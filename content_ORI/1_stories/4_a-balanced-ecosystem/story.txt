Title: A balanced ecosystem

----

Text: We are Black Isle Permaculture & Arts (BIPA), an ecological household, garden and woodland on the Black Isle, 13km north of Inverness in the Highlands of Scotland. We offer off grid tourist accommodation, courses, workshops and volunteering opportunities covering a variety of topics focused on sustainable and regenerative living, such as forest gardening, organic food growing and preserving. The household and gardens are being transformed using Permaculture design and techniques to create a balanced ecosystem for people, plants and animals while also adapting to the unfolding climate and ecological crisis. On the 2.5 acre garden and woodland, we aim to live a creative, sustainable and resilient lifestyle by the three simple principles of People Care, Earth Care and Future Care: a place where people can visit, stay, learn and share.
