Title: Vital role in your mental health

----

Text: I was a bit more conscious about what food I was buying. But I realised that during the height of lockdown with the restrictions on things we couldnâ€™t do, how much a role food played in comfort and providing entertainment - a thing to do in the evening after work with trying new recipes. And it is a privilege to experiment, but for those that can I think food can play such a vital role in your mental health and in trying new foods and pushing boundaries with what you wouldn't eat before.
