Title: Keep local businesses alive

----

Text: I have been a vegetarian for almost 20 years mainly for welfare issues but also because I do not like the thought of my food being pumped with chemicals. Due to the coronavirus outbreak, I have noticed more people are buying fruit and veg locally, myself included. I want to keep local businesses alive. I also feel that my local farm shops have better quality fruit and veg compared to supermarkets, and they are more sustainably packaged too (often coming 'naked' or in a paper bag which I am fine with). It is more expensive but I dont mind paying extra to help local businesses, and if I am getting quality and, in my opinion, healthier products.
