Title: Bee in my bonnet

----

Text: We grow lots of our own fruit and veg, but we're also lucky to have a weekly market in the village with fish, venison, eggs, pork and other goodies. We bake our own bread - I have a bee in my bonnet about the use of glyphosate to dry cereals, so we use organic flour. And talking of bees we also have 2 hives which give us honey.
