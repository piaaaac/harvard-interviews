Title: Community engagement

----

Text: Through lockdown I initially had more time to experiment a bit more with food and cook at home for my partner. We definitely make more effort to be a bit more adventurous with our grocery shopping - we got really bored of the same standardised supermarket things, we've been actively making more of an effort to visit the wonderful diverse array of local middle eastern, continental European and Asian shops in Leith to buy things we have never tried before and giving it a go (and very conscious of supporting local small businesses too). We have been really aware of the privilege of this too, so trying to ask homeless people if they want us to pick up food and supporting national and local food bank charities including the amazing Scran Academy and Social Bite brownies too to our community partners as we've really been missing the usual tea and biscuits that fuel community engagement and relationship building!
