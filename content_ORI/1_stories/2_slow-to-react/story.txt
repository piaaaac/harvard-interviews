Title: Slow to react

----

Text: My experience of C19 lockdown confirms the argument in favour of small local shops and how they reacted much better than supermarkets. Being independent / community-run, they have demonstrated greater flexibility as they were able to respond much faster to the changes and their community’s needs. I was super impressed with the Penicuik Storehouse, how fast they organised and coordinated the collections and deliveries around town. While people were saying they could not get any slots for the ‘big four’, the Storehouse staff & volunteers were working hard in the shop, stocking up, packing, and out delivering groceries every day. They also had a table outside with a plastic screen (at least 2 weeks before supermarkets even started using them!), enabling people to collect orders or make a purchase without having to enter the small shop. The supermarkets were slow to react; first running out of food then overstocking and wasting, also waiting for weeks to receive orders from some distant head office and then take time to implement across the numerous branches, with staff confused, abused and overworked, often on short-term, low paid contracts. This is something we need to remember and demand change to the food system for the future.
