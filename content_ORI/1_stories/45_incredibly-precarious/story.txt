Title: Incredibly precarious

----

Text: We've been trying to highlight to folk for the last three years that our food system in Scotland in the UK is incredibly precarious. And it's only like, one crisis away from people we know, not having food. And what COVID actually did was create a cold, hard reality for people with that. So we found that we didn't have to try and convince people anymore, they believed us. And so the usage of our community fridge shot up, we went from an average of about 63 kilogrammes of food a month went up to 500 kilogrammes of food. What was really interesting was that, as well as the usage of the community fridge going up, the supermarkets were also donating way more food to the fridge as well, because actually, they had a whole load of surplus food, there was other stuff that people weren't buying apart from pasta and bread or whatever, there was a whole load of other food, which they were over supplying, there was way too much. So that came funnelled into our community fridge. And it would go within half an hour, like we would fill the fridge and it would be gone.
