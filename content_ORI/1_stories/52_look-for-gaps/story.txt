Title: Look for gaps

----

Text: Our sales and Nursery greenhouses, which would normally have house plants/council flowers, instead switched to being used for vegetable production – a successional planting scheme was drawn up by our knowledgeable gardener who is also a grower. On top of the overall produce, we also have had continuous supply of fresh salad leaves throughout these months. Due to the isolating nature of the lockdown, the more widely recognised benefits of gardening to benefit mental wellbeing formed the basis of providing seed packets to vulnerable and shielding groups. The “Green Health Packs” were trialled initially in the Badenoch and Strathspey area. They proved to be such a success that we provided to many rural areas thereafter. We were actively seeking out partnerships with diversity of local groups or individuals to create links between our unused resources or newly created supply and outlets that were in demand. The intention was to look for gaps in the local food systems and trying to fill them at least a bit. Thus, we have been able to provide our produce to a local veg box retailer, or a charity Inverness Foodstuff (at Ness Bank Church) preparing meals for those in need. Additionally, due to the connections of some of our staff members to local allotments, after finishing our planting, a surplus of high-quality vegetable seedlings were donated there.
