Title: Huge surge in demand

----

Text: When lockdown was announced the Whitmuir shop and café closed to walk-in customers. The shop was not an essential service especially as people had to drive to get there - and the risk to staff was significant, especially for those staff living with people who were at particular risk from the disease. The business moved online and for a few weeks experienced a huge surge in demand along with supply chain shortages, delivery challenges and a key member of staff being away. Many new customers offered to become farm supporters as a way to secure a delivery and were told that this wasn’t necessary. As supplies and shops returned to nearer normal, many customers fell away, and deliveries went back to around twice their pre Covid-19 level (LWA September 2020).
