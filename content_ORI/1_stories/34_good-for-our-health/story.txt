Title: Good for our health

----

Text: It has been a dream of ours for some years to have our own vegetable patch. Towards the end of last year we built some raised beds, and placed them in the garden. This year was the first year we have had some crops. I think we chose the perfect year to start a new hobby thatâ€™s good for our health and good for the planet. So far, we have grown rhubarb, potatoes, carrots, strawberries, tomatoes, kale, brussel sprouts and lettuce.
