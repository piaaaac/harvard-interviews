Title: Sign of a broken food system

----

Text: I have enjoyed building a community around food in Rosyth for the last few years, accessible to everyone, based on fun, learning and sharing. It is disheartening to see that work had to turn into emergency food aid during Covid, a sign of a broken food system. The system should ensure food is accessible to all and allow the energies of food workers to go into building food literacy, growing local supply chains and community wellbeing instead of purely food provision.
