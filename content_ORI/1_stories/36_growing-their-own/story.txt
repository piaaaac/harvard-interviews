Title: Growing their own

----

Text: I love the idea of the Highland Good Food Conversation and think it's an important one to be having especially at the moment. It's been so great to see so many people enjoying growing their own this year. I find being out in the garden and seeing seeds grow very therapeutic and yeah it just makes me feel better! There are lots of exciting things happening here in the Highlands and I'm really interested to keep learning about it all.
