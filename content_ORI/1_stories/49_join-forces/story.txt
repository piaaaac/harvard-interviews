Title: Join forces

----

Text: The biggest blow is the lack of weddings which is a fair chunk of our income and we can’t see these getting back to normal in the near future. Luckily being a small diverse business means we are able to change and adapt quite easily and these lack of sales gave us more time to look at the wider flower market and how we can work together to reduce the use of imported flowers. The lack of restaurant and other wholesale was a worry as this is important to our business but it coincided with a rise in the use of online food hubs which we were selling to around 200 customers during the busiest time through 3 different hubs. We are looking at setting up a food hub here at Comrie Croft as the farmshop here has really suffered from Covid-19 having to close down for two months and now being short staffed. We hope pre-ordered sales will mean the shop can offer more variety especially of perishable items (like our own) and will be less risky for buying things in. We were also supported by our local baker who quickly had to change their wholesale business to doorstop retail and hubs and we were able to offer salad, other greens and cut flowers alongside their bread which is delivered across the central belt. It was great to see another business react to quickly and positively to the situation and join forces (LWA September 2020).
