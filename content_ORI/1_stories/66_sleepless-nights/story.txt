Title: Sleepless nights

----

Text: I was having sleepless nights when people were being told not to eat at restaurants because that was 80% of our business that was going to disappear overnight. We very quickly managed to realign, and we have been incredibly lucky with the support we have had locally and nationally from people coming and buying from our local shop or ordering online. We are now doing a months’ worth of work every two to three days, but our food service business is still patchy depending on the geography of our customers. Those on the north and west coast continue to be busy however those inland are a bit quieter. We are helping the local community by teaming up with local business who don’t have the same resources as us and making their deliveries for them. We have also been going to the Co-op to collect milk and butter for people that are self-isolating. That way, vulnerable people who can’t leave their homes don’t need to wait for weeks to receive their supermarket orders. We have put in an honesty shop up at the farm to serve the local community and those wishing to travel from further afield. We stock the essentials and try and support other local producers so that they have an outlet for their products. For example eggs from the farm next door (NFFN).
