Title: Eating organic and locally

----

Text: My food story is about eating organic and locally sourced food as much as you can. We use a local organic supplier Knockfarrel Produce who deliver a great variety of veg, eggs, cheese and pork. Over the last couple of years I have got into fermenting food which is a great way to preserve some of the organic veg... I have fermenting chillies and garlic on the go at the moment ready to make my own spicy sauce.
