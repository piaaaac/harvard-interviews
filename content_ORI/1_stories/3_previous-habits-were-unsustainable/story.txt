Title: Previous habits were unsustainable

----

Text: As the country went into lockdown, my family and I had to adjust the way we shop. Before COVID-19, it was so convenient to pop to shops whenever we needed ingredients for dinner. However with a little bit of forward planning, we have went from making daily visits to the supermarkets pre-lockdown, to just one visit to the supermarket per week during lockdown. My mum is a NHS key worker, so we want to completely minimise our exposure to large gatherings of people and risk of infection. As a family it has made us conscious not only of what ingredients go into our meals and how we can use these efficiently throughout the week, the COVID lockdown has made us aware of our carbon footprint through the countless car journeys we would make to get food on the table. Before, daily car trips to get a basket of items – we were clocking up fuel consumption and so, emissions. Making this change to our daily/weekly life during COVID has been eye-opening that our previous habits were unsustainable – I don’t think we will go back to the way it was before.
