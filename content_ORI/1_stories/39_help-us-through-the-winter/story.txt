Title: Help us through the winter

----

Text: Most of us like wild roses and their berries help us through the winter. In Europe and Western Asia it is the native sweetbriar rose (rosa rubiginosa). It is a deciduous shrub reaching 2-3 m high and can serve as an excellent hedge plant. There are quite some health benefits collecting rose hips for your home. They can be eaten raw as berries (though take care of the hairs inside the fruit). Most often they are used for herbal tea, jam, jelly, syrup, soup, wine, pies and bread. Wild rose hips are very high in vitamin C, and as we are facing a dark pandemic winter, we need to enhance our vitamin intake. The hips also contain several carotenoids such as b-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin and lycopene. These antioxidants are very important, especially in winter time. If you have rose hip bushes close by, do go out and collect some. Dry them at home and do make your own tea. Best is to let water boil and put some dried hips into the boiling water and let it boil for a couple of minutes. You can also throw a bit of ginger in there. Enjoy this tea spiked with vitamins and antioxidants. Alternatively I suggest you may want to also use rose hips for your fruit salads, which will give them an additional flair.
