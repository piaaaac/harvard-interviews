Title: I have been inspired

----

Text: I have been pleasantly surprised that on the whole the food system has worked well. I was scared when folks started panic buying but resisted it and thankfully things settled. Flour and yeast are like gold dust but generally I've been able to get everything else. I've bought mainly from the village shop and local farm shops, only using supermarkets 3 times in 8 weeks. Usually I mainly use supermarket. I have been inspired to plant tatties, onions, parsnips, 2 apple trees, 2 blueberry bushes, raspberries, strawberries and rhubarb this year.
