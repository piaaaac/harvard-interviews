Title: Human beings are amazing

----

Text: Covid time with mum age 89. Tubs of flowers planted for visitors in empty streets, see their beauty at every stage  on our slow walks . Polite communications, smiles good mornings as never before in St. Andrews, fresh fresh divinely fresh air and wild bird song. Nowhere for a coffee. Tractors barrelling through North street, why they are going so fast? Emotional? Mum fainted out on a walk with me. Scary. Social distancing evaporates as passers by help. Angels in the shape of ambulance men share their calm wisdom. Human beings are amazing. How fragile life is sometimes, slowing down to make bridges and acting quickly to save things.
