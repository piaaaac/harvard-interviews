Title: Build resilience in the community

----

Text: So for me, the thing that that's kind of interesting about food is what we're trying to do is to kind of build resilience in the community. So that's one by kind of looking at all of the issues across the board that this that this kind of, you know, good food is embedded in there. And it tackles, as we say, sort of everybody's got, what he's got to connect with food, you know, if you eat you're in. And so it seems that it's a really useful tool to kind of take out there as a way of engaging with people, and getting more people to kind of be involved in different aspects of, you know, what's happening in their community or what isn't happening and trying to make that happen. So, yeah, that's the journey we're on.
