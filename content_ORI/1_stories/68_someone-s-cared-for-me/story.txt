Title: Someone's cared for me

----

Text: The Community Council decided that a hot food delivery project was what was needed, because there was some people isolating and some people in povertyâ€¦ it meant a lot in terms of the personal touch and the emotional value - that someone's cared for me to provide this. So it was sort of a different service than the food parcels which was ran by another organisation. But it was a really good insight into, what would a resilient community look like if people need that service? How do we get that food to them in an efficient way? And I think that the local provision came from somebody whose business was under threat, because of losing business because of the lockdown. So, she was able to help out. And I think that sometimes very local provision is better value than some of the big companies that councils signed contracts with, and people can't afford those. So is it just shows how and local knowledge and skills and really contribute to community being brought together like that. So, I found I found that in that that whole situation was really interesting.
