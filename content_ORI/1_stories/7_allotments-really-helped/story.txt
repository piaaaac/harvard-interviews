Title: Allotments really helped

----

Text: Allotments really helped those of us fortunate enough to have one, cope with the crisis. However the other day a father outside the site said to me, ‘My family and I would love to help you, we are willing to dig or do anything’. I asked if he had his name down for a plot but he replied ‘No, there is no point, I want it for my sons now so they can experience how things grow but there is a 10 year waiting list. The people over there have gardens but we live in these flats without anything. It is so difficult at the moment’ . I felt sad. I wittered on about stalled spaces, community gardens and the legislation in the Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015 that local authorities have a duty to provide allotments. I knew that was no real help to him. He wants a patch of ground of his own - now. He wants a place where his children can nurture plants and flowers and be nurtured by them. This is why I campaign for more Allotments - People’s Gardens available for everyone. The experience this year has confirmed more than ever that we need them if we are to survive.
