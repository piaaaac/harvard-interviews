Title: Farms were left with little support

----

Text: March 2020 saw an unprecedented increase in demand for food in the UK, with supermarket shelves lying empty, and rationing systems set up for some essential items. This was not just an inconvenience in our usually convenient system. People lost their jobs and homes overnight and were forced to food banks, with food bank usage nearly doubling in comparison to 2019. Supply from supermarkets to food banks dropped as more food was being sold in store, pushing some food banks to close. At the same time, as much as £20million of fresh food destined for hospitality and schools was at risk of being dumped, and thousands of litres of milk were poured down the drain as dairy farmers lost their markets. For many people, our supply chains broke down, exposing the weaknesses in the global, just-in-time system. As is so often the case, farms were left with little support or security as prices and demand fluctuated. Covid-19 is not the last crisis we will see over the next few years. The climate crisis is now widely recognised as one of the biggest, if not the single biggest threat to food security. We need to act quickly to transform our food system to one that is more resilient, creates decent livelihoods for producers, and is based on principles of agroecology and food sovereignty. Direct sales systems offer one tool to help build the food system that we urgently need.
