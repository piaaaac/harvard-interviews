Title: It was heart-breaking

----

Text: In the east end of Glasgow, the initiative that we started with 20 people got to 3000 a week. And the amount of people that were very vulnerable that we unearthed that hadn't eaten nothing from one day to the next. But they didn't have the methods of communication to get it out. There was no social work involvement. They werenâ€™t neighbourly per se, but they were sitting just on their own and it was heart-breaking, especially the elderly - a lot of a generation that just won't ask for help. And it was really quite upsetting at times.
