Title: Disrupted food chains everywhere

----

Text: I live on my parents farm. And we do sustainable wool. And it's something I'm really passionate about. But then COVID happens and obviously disrupted food chains everywhere. And I'm half Australian. So I saw the difference between my family in Australia, and their access to food, the food chain in Queensland compared to rural Aberdeenshire. And it kind of made me think that probably someone like me, should be making more food for the local area. And it's really been trying to just start out with eggs, you know, and grow my own veg. I tried to work out from there how to feed a local area.
