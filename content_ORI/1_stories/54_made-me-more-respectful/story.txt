Title: Made me more respectful

----

Text: I knew I wanted to buy more locally… and this has sort of driven us to that. It really transformed my relationship to that local food system and there's a whole range of other small businesses that have been brought through to me, or made it really easy for me to go and get food from them…  I think it's transformed what I know about my local community. I think it's made me more grounded within my local community. It's made me more respectful and aware of the key workers and that in the in the broadest sense of the word. And it's introduced us to some great small producers and small brands.
