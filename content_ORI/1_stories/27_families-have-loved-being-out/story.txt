Title: Families have loved being out

----

Text: Transition Edinburgh South, have been supporting local families during COVID-19 pandemic at the Gracemount Community Garden - a beautiful space in garden of Gracemount Mansion House in South of Edinburgh. In the garden there are beds of vegetables, fruit, as well as flowers and wild patches. During the pandemic the project received funding from the Scottish Government's Wellbeing Fund to organise gardening sessions for 15 families. The families have loved being out in the gardens, with activities like ladybird minibeast hunt as well as focused practical garden activity, such as harvesting, weeding, or sowing. Families would gather fresh produce at the garden session. Great to see that throughout the project there was an increase in number of people visiting the gardens and showing an interest in making use of their local green space.
