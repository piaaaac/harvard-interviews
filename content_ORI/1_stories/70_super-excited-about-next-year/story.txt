Title: Super excited about next year

----

Text: I started growing veg in a walled garden for the first time this year. I feel like I had more failures than successes but it was a huge amount of fun and I learned lots. The most important thing I learned is you have to get the nutrients in your soil right. I am super excited about next year.
