Title: Go for it in the garden

----

Text: What I find in lockdown is I've been stuck at home the whole time. You're working from home, my wife's working from home. And it's been very advantageous because although you're working from home, you are also sort of being able to do stuff in the garden. What I found is that we've actually had the perfect storm this year for home growing. Because, you know, we saw the lockdown come in, we thought, well, there's going to be problems with food. But we thought let's just go for it in the garden, let's just see how much we can grow from our garden, we've got your bog standard sort of semi detached tires, the bit in front, the bit in the back. So we basically put down food everywhere. And, you know, it's just of all went very well. And, in fact, it went too well, because we seem to have the perfect mix of rain, sun, no real pests this year. And so far, I haven't bought any fruit or veg since June. I've eaten more potatoes than I think I've ever eaten in a couple of months. I think we've got enough potatoes until Marchâ€¦ supermarkets just really aren't a thing for me now.
