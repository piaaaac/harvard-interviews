Title: Engaged families to grow

----

Text: I live in West Lothian, where the main source of food comes from major supermarket chains. There is very few shops selling locally sourced food. During lockdown, my neighbour created a Garden Co-op. We live in a small rural community, the Co-op has enabled my neighbours and I to share crops from our gardens in a socially distant way. The Garden Co-op has been really popular: it has given households, who do not have vegetable patches in their garden, the opportunity to grow their own vegetables. In the Co-op my neighbours and I have shared crops of Brussel sprouts, tomatoes, lettuce, and more. The Co-op has created a sense of community during these difficult times, it has engaged families to grow their own food thus positive attitude changes towards how we source food. My hope is that the Garden Co-op will continue long after lockdown and continue to promote a sense of community and nutritional food.
