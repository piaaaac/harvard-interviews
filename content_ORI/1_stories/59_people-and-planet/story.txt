Title: People and planet

----

Text: I’ve been in awe of people’s passion and creativity for food during this pandemic. I’ve eagerly watched a friend innovatively – and successfully – grow veg in a repurposed sled in her Edinburgh flat, and seen my sister transform her disused allotment into an organic kitchen garden that’s also acted as a haven for wildlife. This health crisis has taught me that we do need a different food system, one that is more diverse, resilient and adaptable. Above all, it’s shown me that we need a system that is fair to both the people and planet. To me, a system that supports more low carbon kitchen and community gardeners can take us a step closer to delivering this vision.
