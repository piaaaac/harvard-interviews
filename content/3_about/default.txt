Title: About the stories

----

Text:

Welcome to the Scottish Food Coalition’s Food Stories project. This project started in 2020 during
the COVID-19 pandemic. We invite you to explore the wheel to read over 80 Scottish food stories,
from the Highlands and Islands, to the Borders, Fife and beyond. These are the voices of people in
the food system - from farmers and food bank users to community groups and asylum seekers.
These stories showcase the challenges, as well as the opportunities in Scotland’s food system. They
illustrate why we need to prioritise the wellbeing of people and our environment when we’re
making decisions on our food system. We want to keep adding stories to the wheel, so that we have
a rich collection of experiences. This will help us speak up for change. Please click (link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdmZDporYcBNMS6AqcH0X57Q2ECUJrGACGY5Y-a2cdOPSt-nA/viewform?gxids=7628 text: here target: _blank) to add your
own story.
