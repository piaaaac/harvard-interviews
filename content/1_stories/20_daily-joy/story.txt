Title: Daily joy

----

Text: As the world battles COVID-19, the climate and nature crisis, racial and social injustice and beyond, this food story is one of extreme fortune and appreciation while spending Spring/Summer at home in rural Scotland. I went home to my parents house for a weekend, and instead stayed for the for 4 months of lockdown. Privileged with a garden – and filling furloughed hours - growing food became my new obsession. My plant babies (including herbs, tomatoes, leafy greens, cauliflower and courgettes) brought me daily joy. Every time they made a tiny bit of progress, I shared it with anyone who’d listen. I realised just how long it takes for a single bit of food to grow, previously naïve to the laborious process and vulnerability of plants to external conditions – too much/little water, mice, insects, the highly unpredictable Scottish weather to name a few. Each change in the season brought new excitement and challenges with it. In late summer, we ate a meal made entirely of home-grown veggies and my partner commented that it was probably the lowest environmental impact meal we’d ever had. This novice, small scale experience has given me a passionate appreciation for home-grown goodies. Ever aware of how lucky the experience, and now back in my city flat, I am determined to keep a seasonal approach to cooking, with a small windowsill herb garden and new veg box subscription and far more thought about exactly how much time and energy goes into producing each item. I hope the future sees investment in organic, locally produced veggies with a healthier, more environmentally friendly food systems as the norm, rather than a luxury.
