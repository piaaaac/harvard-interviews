Title: 235 CAPE TOWN Unsuccessful Smirnoff (division 7) MTV Smirnoff storm/DiaggioÂ  Project in Alcohol industry

Text: Even with us doing these fillable stuff, it was such a rush, such an incredible rush, and then everyone was just working through the night, and then it sits on people's offices before it goes out for a long time. And that's often the problem with creative process. They ... everybody, even the crafting, like it's important, a good idea can be fantastic. If it's not well crafted, it can fall flat. You can't do it the other way around, but I really really believe a good idea can become a good idea through crafting, except its idea is crafting. But the other way around, you can have a fantastic concept, and if it hasn't got a good budget, or you haven't got the backing of the organizing, of the ... which leads me to a bad project. It looked quite successful, I think. Overall it was successful. It was successful. But our process was, like, I think the workers, like, I was incredibly overworked for that time, because everything was very badly managed in the way of communication. You know, things would, we had like, an idea, and it was presented, then it came back, it just stayed in the system for a long time. Like they bombed it. And then in the end there was only very little time left. That's often when the process goes, 'cause then you haven't got the time that you needed for it. If you had the same kind of idea at an event company doing it, they'd have years to, or six months, or whatever, doing a big project that has a lot of logistics and ... you can't just do something quickly, and then ... You know, and that project often felt so much miscommunication, 'cause also Smirnoff thing, it was Division 7, and was this promotion with MTV Base and Smirnoff Storm. And yeah, I just ended up being, like, taking so long, I mean, for, actually for stuff to go ahead, and I actually started working on stuff before we got the go 'cause I knew that, like, there's no was I was actually doing this thing in the timing if I don't start. I still worked on staff, I'd already had the deadline without having any briefs on my desk. And then, I mean, there wasn't briefs, it was so badly, it was so badly done. And it was just miscommunication and things not, it was too much work, too little people. That was actually the problem, I'd say. We're being understaffed. And you can't just get something out. It's not about, you know, if we had to brief someone outside to quickly do a design thing, we'd give them proper time. You know, you'd give them ... but in house, if you do something in house, you can't just, you can't expect it to happen here and do the same quality. To have the same crafting time. Often. We had the same thing happen with ... there was another project the other day ... it was very frustrating ... had everything already down the line. Ooh, it was actually, that was a bad project. Actually that was worse than Division 7. Ooh, it was bad. It was another billboard. I did quite a lot of billboards in a row. It was another billboard, so between the Division 7 thing. And at the time we were quite understaffed. So our traffic lady was doing like, traffic buying as well as ... our buying and traffic. And that's nuts. You can't do all of that. And with that project, it was very embarrassing because our time was incredibly tight. This one was also too tight, the timing. It was too tight. And what happened was she was ... after we had, because we had to go along with the process, and the client said we have this much. So we got a nice photographer from London to come out. She used to live here, but then she came through. But then, in the end I had to cut the thing by less than half, something like that, which was insanely ... it's a very very bad way, we couldn't cater, we couldn't warm the pool, we couldn't ... it was actually quite embarrassing. It was terrible. That's actually happened quite a few times. Cutting budgets suddenly. It's really not cool. It's them. It's suddenly realize they have less money. That's hap-...
