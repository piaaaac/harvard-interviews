Title: Successful Temaiken Zoo Project in Travel/tourism industry

----

Text: Yes that went well, the process went well, we presented three different campaigns. That was the first work we did for that client and they were graphic campaigns, and they immediately approved one and they trusted how we were going to produce it. We produced it in a very particular way with some miniature modes were we made the animals and people who visited the park, it was like a cartoon they looked like toys. Which is a process that the clients have to trust because you can’t visualize it until it is done. But they trusted us and they models came out very well and the campaign was out on the streets, it was very talked about and it won several awards in the Creative Circle Festival which is the most important one in Argentina. It was a very good process; it was good from beginning to end. The ones we dealt with were marketing or advertising managers, and the final word, even when we didn’t have any contact with her, did come from the director of Temaiken, we did not have any contact with her. She was not in all of the process, they are the directors at the highest level, they are almost the owners of the company, they do see it in a more advanced process. Oh inside our team? Yes, they were very good. Yes, that is very important that the relationships inside the team are also good. Video, yes, they had chosen the agency because they liked the creativity style of the agency, so then they trusted the ideas of the agency, they were very open to move on with this resolution, with creativity. n the end there were some dialogues as if the animals could talk, because in children’s imagination animals can think and talk, it was like a dialogue between the young kid, the little boy and the animal. I believe that they both said the same thing. In the sense that they allowed the process to flow, I mean when a client has a very good relationship with the agency, they are open to recommendations and ideas from the agency and also open to trust what the agency is telling them is good for their brand. Also, let’s say we are open to corrections of what they think is necessary. I mean they know the brand, but when the process is good, everything is constructive. And that was the case. Good. I mean they also supported the campaign we presented they also worked toward the same goal, they also had a good relationship, they played their part with the client. They made the client feel comfortable too. It was a good process in general.  Well, that we all agreed and we all worked together and it was very clear to us what we wanted and, yes we all worked together toward the same goal. It is a relationship that happens, if it is good, it is good for all of the projects. It is important for it to be good, I don’t know if there is anything else you would like to know about how good it was. It is not that they all say, “Okay it’s fine” to this and that but that the discussions and the insight, I mean it makes the work grow, that is what a good relationship is.
