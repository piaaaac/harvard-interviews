Title: Drop in sales

----

Text: Currently, and despite Covid-19 and lack of outdoor markets, we have many customers already looking ahead to the winter sales. However, there’s likely to be a significant drop in sales to community orchard projects due to lack of funding and ability for community projects to run. As a result I’m potting on quite a lot of trees for sale next year (LWA September 2020).
