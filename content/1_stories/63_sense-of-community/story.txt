Title: Sense of community

----

Text: I think in my locality people in general have been very helpful towards each other. And we've got to know neighbours we didn't know before, especially when we were clapping for the NHS. And, you know, that brought about a sense of community. And as far as our local group is concerned, we're trying to liaise with the council to plant apple trees in areas of east Craigs, which we hope will be of use to the community and maybe expanded on – I’ve been reading a lot about urban growing.
