Title: 231 CAPE TOWN Successful Smirnoff Pitch Project in Alcohol industry

----

Text: Well in the time that I've been here, we were working on a pitch, a spinoff pitch. And me, it was really great to work with quite a big team. And quite a big team that are quite experienced and have had a lot of experience because then, their ideas obviously become our ideas. And I gained a lot from that, personally. Yeah. We're still waiting to find out what the outcome of it was, but yeah. To me, it was very complete. It was broad. It was [inaudible 00:06:33] it. It was in the case of we just did it. It was ... we pulled a lot of ideas, a lot of thoughts, a lot of actual physical doing the work. And then we came at it from a very objective angle. And just to make sure the whole time that we were on track, that we were on brief. That we had the right thing. And it was very exciting to see how it had evolved from a small idea to actually quite a well thought out, massive thing. [inaudible 00:07:08] in terms of strategy, creativity. Yeah, and what we had to offer the client. Yeah, what other ... I think in the time that I've been here, each job has actually been quite successful in itself. But it's probably because I'm still a new broom sweep clean. Cause everything's great. Yeah.   Absolutely. And that, I think for me, as well as being able to pitch the work that you do. Have somebody able to actually sell it at the same time and be confident and energized and vibrant and excited about the stuff that we do. Which is cool.
