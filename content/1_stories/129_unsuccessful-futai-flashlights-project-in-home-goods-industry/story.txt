Title: Unsuccessful Futai flashlights Project in Home goods industry

----

Text: For me, I'll pick Flash. The flashlight project. It didn't go well at the end, but it went pretty well, content wise, while I did a [RHF 00:30:19], but while I did [RHF 00:30:21], I was super tired and then I felt that project wasn't well managed at all. And also, it's not sketched proper as well, so it's really like chicken and egg because based on the quality of the content, we didn't have enough resource. , I feel I need to take beautiful roles and then finish all the things just by myself, and that was super tired. And then, during the project, also because lack of resource Then, maybe Andy can tell you more story about Flash because he handled the last bigger bit which is we had to determine the project because our client didn't want to pay. The thing is, because they didn't really have budget, so they could only afford three weeks of research, so that means one week preparation, another week to do the research, and the third week is to synthesize plus the documentation. And then, because it's for the U.S. market, so we need to go to the State. Also, because short of budget, only me can fly to the State to carry out the research. At that time, I need to find another partner in the State to help me do the research because we have to have two people instead of one people to go to people's house. So, that's the case. Supposedly, two, but during HF phase, they didn't really give any feedback and then the key client, he actually fall asleep during the presentation, although I believe it's not boring at all. Then, he just like fall asleep, so that's very annoying. he actually fall asleep during the presentation, although I believe it's not boring at all. Then, he just like fall asleep, so that's very annoying. That would be ... Besides me and Jesse [Ofair 00:36:09], was also involved, because I think Jesse, as the Project Manager, he's a very good engineer, but he's a very unexperienced Content Manager in the HF phase, so he's more like a budget controller. He can barely give any suggestions, or very few suggestions how to make decisions in terms of HF. Zero. It was actually very funny because when they came to us for those two flashlights, they all described and said they want something very unique. Different from anything in the market and for the open ended one it would be have never seen before, so that's what we did and then we realized first, for those really open ended ones, we didn't really have experience to make judgment, so basically their judgment is based on their vendor. Their buyer, so they expected the buyer will give them the feedback; however, buyer were not capable of doing that. When the buyer sees those very open ended ones, because they're also not really mentioning two people, they just give very negative feedback. t was actually very funny because when they came to us for those two flashlights, they all described and said they want something very unique.

When the buyer sees those very open ended ones, because they're also not really mentioning two people, they just give very negative feedback. Oh, yeah. Mentioned about testing. Originally our assumption is they're going to test those concepts with their buyers, but because they just gave our rough TD drawings to the buyers and the buyers, usually the only thing they saw were the concrete physical products, so they felt oh, the concept really sucks, and they couldn't understand those 2D drawings, too. So, we were joking and say oh, yeah. Probably we need to pick a really strange time to talk to that guy so that guy will thought we were calling from the State. Both of them were really tight. The client didn't accept that because he regard as more like from a manufacturer point of view rather than a service provider, so we didn't put anything forward at the end. And then, during the project, also because lack of resource, I feel I need to take beautiful roles and then finish all the things just by myself, and that was super tired. Then, maybe Andy can tell you more story about Flash because he handled the last bigger bit which is we had to determine the project because our client didn't want to pay. Originally, they respected us in the hope we can help them to earn three hundred billions back by selling on flashlight, so they regard to work with us although we were expensive, but it going to be a very profitable investment. At the end, they hate us, and they feel we were cheating them, so our relationship just sucks. Andy probably can tell you more stories because the client yelled to him and say lots of dirty words. Anyway, we did refine this and, I guess, add part of a engineering effort to it, but at that time, the client started to argue about the fee because they said they asked us to decrease the money because we are not going to deliver the other one, that extreme open ended one. For our perspective, yes, we can charge you less because we're going to do less work, but not the one. The work has already happened. From the actual point is from the people's behavior, so we studied the user's in the State and realized this is a very friendly shape in terms of where to give this stub a home or a temporary home because it's not rounded. It won't rolling around in your drawer. It was real interesting because while Jesse, our Project Manager, called the buyer and tried to do the same thing, he basically used 13 minutes to convince the buyer that we are not IDEO counterfeit in China. At the very end, the buyer say okay, I believe you. You are legitimate company, but he still didn't believe we were IDEO. but he's a very unexperienced Content Manager in the HF phase, so he's more like a budget controller. He can barely give any suggestions, or very few suggestions how to make decisions in terms of HF. Supposedly, two, but during [HF 00:35:29] phase, they didn't really give any feedback and then the key client, he actually fall asleep during the presentation, although I believe it's not boring at all. Then, he just like fall asleep, so that's very annoying. Then, we also realized the client didn't understand our process at all so probably that would be a offset scenario. At that point, the client just go really crazy like oh, no, IDEO really sucks. You need to re-done all the projects. All the flashlights, and then at the end, first of all they drop the extremely open ended ones because they didn't know how to deal with it and then, for that traditional flashlight, they couldn't really find a buyer to give a legible feedback or useful feedback so the buyer just ... Their buyer, so they expected the buyer will give them the feedback; however, buyer were not capable of doing that. When the buyer sees those very open ended ones, because they're also not really mentioning two people, they just give very negative feedback. We felt surprised because we didn't expect that's the way he going to interact with the buyer, and the buyer only had two minutes to look at those things, so the buyer didn't really have time to think about how they are going to use those concepts. I heard one other business model IDEO, in the stated, was the Chinese manufacturer will find the IDEO in other location and then leverage IDEO's fame and then while they pitch to those buyers, there was oh, by the way, IDEO is designing for us, so that gave them the credential.  So they go really like panic and then we tried to explain our process to them. This is iterate process and you need to give feedback and refine the concept, but not jump to the end in one step, but they couldn't' understand that and didn't want to accept, and they don't want to cooperate as well, so that's why we failed.
