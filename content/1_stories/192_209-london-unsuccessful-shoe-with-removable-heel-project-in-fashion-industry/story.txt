Title: 209 LONDON Unsuccessful Shoe with removable heel Project in Fashion industry

----

Text: Our project [inaudible 00:18:46] was properly a disaster. That was... we were designing, stupid idea, shoes, right? Women's shoes. This is like, here was this inventor who'd been carrying this idea around since university that she wanted to design shoes with interchangeable heels. So you could wear them in office with one inch, and then go out at night and stick a three inch on, or whatever you want to do. And we took this project on in a bad time, I think, as well because we weren't doing very well financially. So we took this thing on, and it was just a nightmare because it was her baby, she'd loved this thing since she was eighteen or whatever, she had all these funky ideas of what we would've wanted to do, and we did the whole process. We went out, we had a few women, and we found that nobody wanted them. Everybody thought they were a shit idea. Women don't want one pair of shoes that change heel sizes. Women want twenty pairs of shoes, all different colors and all different heel sizes. She had an investment from a nester, she had about 90 grand or something, and she ended up, not suing us, but basically not paying us. Not being very unhappy with the delivery and all that stuff. We didn't even finish the project actually because it was [inaudible 00:20:37]. We told her, we were very honest about it, we said look, we don't think it's a good idea, we don't think you should pursue it, we think you should go somewhere else to get this done. We can give you this bit now, we can give you the user insert bit, and call it a day, and she's like, no, you're the designer, I want you to finish it, I want you to make a model, I was just like, ah, fuck it, we don't believe in it. We don't believe in it, that was the problem. So it's hard, when you get a client who wants something they're getting and you just don't believe in it. It's really fuckin' hard to design it. I mean, I guess that might... There was no point, the things that we told her, she didn't agree with as well. She wanted to go in at the very high end, into the retail, she wanted to sell these in fuckin' Prada, you know what I mean? And we're just like, why don't you just sell them at Top Shop for like $9.99? Exactly. And she just had it all wrong. She had this whole fuckin' idea about licensing it to Prada. It was a complete dream. It was a dream. It was a sham, because we shattered it for her. I have no idea what she's doing now, so So we took this thing on, and it was just a nightmare because it was her baby, she'd loved this thing since she was eighteen or whatever, she had all these funky ideas of what we would've wanted to do, and we did the whole process. So, we really didn't get any inspiration, and it was an engineering nightmare. You'd imagine, it's not where a foot goes from there to there, there's some very, very freaky engineering problems to deal with if you're talking about support and clicking this heel in and all this stuff. The [inaudible 00:20:15] changes dramatically. And it just went really badly. We can give you this bit now, we can give you the user insert bit, and call it a day, and she's like, no, you're the designer, I want you to finish it, I want you to make a model, I was just like, ah, fuck it, we don't believe in it. We don't believe in it, that was the problem. There was no point, the things that we told her, she didn't agree with as well.

And we're just like, why don't you just sell them at Top Shop for like $9.99?   She had this whole fuckin' idea about licensing it to Prada. It was a complete dream. It was a dream. It was a sham, because we shattered it for her. I have no idea what she's doing now, so.
