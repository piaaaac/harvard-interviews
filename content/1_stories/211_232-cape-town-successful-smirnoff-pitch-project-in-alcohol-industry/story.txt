Title: 232 CAPE TOWN Successful Smirnoff Pitch Project in Alcohol industry

----

Text: What was so great about it is the fact we came, we addressed it from a South African agency, so we kind of incorporated the Joburg agency quite well into it. The Jo burg Creative Director came down, and then he was actually presenting the work to the client, because Con was away. Because of that happening we pulled all the Joburg creatives as well as the Cape Town branch ones. And then halfway into our tangent we stopped and we presented to the MD, Jim. And we presented Cape Town's ideas. Then Dave, the Joburg Creative Director, presented what the Joburg guys had done. It was really interesting to see the Jobug's ideas in comparison to ours. There was a lot of overlaps, we had come up with similar ideas. But then it was kind of picking out what was working in one, and what wasn't working in the other, and then just kind of merging the two as best as possible. Which I found quite interesting, and it was also nice to get an outsider's, or look from an outsider point of view at the same job. If you know what I'm saying. And how they approached it. And then looking- [crosstalk 00:01:39] Cause then it was interesting for us cause then we could then obviously see what was working for us, and then also see what wasn't. Similarities were, for example we had come up with the idea to have this club. A card club, that was consistent in both of them. And obviously the card offered those things. What else did we have that was kind of similar? Basically a lot of the elements, the mechanics of the campaign were very similar. Kind of coming with two different concepts, one was very much based on respect. The other one, our one, was based on stepping into a different environment. So that was cool. I'm not too sure, actually. Perhaps, it could be just the creatives themselves, who ever briefed them, how they perceived the brief. How they understood it. It's supposed to be quite elite, but subtly so. Or accomplished, let's say. And we approached it from more like you're accomplished but you don't mind letting your hair down at the same time. Whereas they didn't maybe take that step further and go like we're letting our hair down although we are accomplished. It just kind of stayed at accomplished. I don't know if it's perhaps becomes the time that one is given, where creative thought processes stop or have to stop. That maybe refers back to what I was saying about things not really starting, it just is a cycle and you stop where you're told to stop so to speak. We then picked it apart, addressed what was working, what wasn't working, and then pulled it all together. For once, before the picture actually got like too many ideas we learned that having too many good ideas is as bad as not having anything at all. So kind of picked it apart and then embraced the areas that we thought Joburg was doing well at or better that us at. And then took our own theme and created our own which we finally pitched. And I think that was pretty solid in the end. Yeah, that was quite successful actually. It's cool to have the interaction between the opposites. I find being part of something gives back, gets people, I don't know, I get a lot out of being a team. I think knowing you've got more people on your team striving for the same ideals, and the same motives can be quite successful. You feel like you've got more of an impact perhaps. Because of that happening we pulled all the Joburg creatives as well as the Cape Town branch ones.
