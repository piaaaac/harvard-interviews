Title: Who defines what food is

----

Text: Itâ€™s interesting to hear about some of the work that was happening around the engagement of different socio-economic background Scotland. The whole good food agenda has, to a certain extent been accused of being a very middle class thing. And where the representative cross section of Scottish voices is not necessarily being involved in the debate. And, and there's a second thing, which is you can provide food, good food, but will people necessarily engage with it? And by people, I mean, everybody. So there's, there's quite a lot of variables here, in terms of who defines what food is, you know, my concept of food of someone from the far north of Scotland, is very likely to be very different to what's happening in an urban context, and even some parts of Edinburgh or Glasgow. So it's more than just this this sort of, I suppose, concept of the right to food. There's quite a lot of bigger issues around it.
