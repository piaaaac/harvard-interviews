Text: Yeah. And we were working on so many different disciplines, the planners, the strategics people, the logistics people and it was really like no one slept for months. It was crazy but you didn't mind at all because you knew the outcome of the event was gonna be so big. It was this game in different cities in like Portland. And it was just crazy but good crazy because no matter the long hours or what not, you had so much passion working for it because you knew it was good. There was something really good. It was a lifetime opportunity to do something great, so I would say that was the most, just because you started something from the very beginning and saw it all the way to the end result, and it was thrilling to work on that.

It was a lifetime opportunity to do something great, so I would say that was the most, just because you started something from the very beginning and saw it all the way to the end result, and it was thrilling to work on that A lot, but the good thing is that we had like one lead had the last call and everything. That was good because you could have many people thinking different things, but at the end he would make the final call. It was pretty risky because nothing, not many companies had done anything like that, so he couldn't quite, it's hard to measure the results and the outcome of it. It could really flop or be a success. So I think they took a risk by doing this. They were just trying to target teenagers, like make it cool for teenagers. No, because this was pretty cheap. Although it was complicated, at the end of the day we just needed to, Quest needed to provide us with cell phones for the kids that they would return back that same day. The inflatable animals weren't expensive. Couple of city permits to lock down some streets and our hotel data base room for thing. No, it was pretty cheap. Well, ups and downs between us and the account people and different disciplines, like you would laugh, yell, cry, everything. We were just beat and tired. The source of inspiration. Well, it was really a team effort. I think that was the only idea. Usually just walk in with one big idea and you feel so strong about it that take it or leave it. Sometimes you play it safe and you show the edgy idea and then the safe idea. Sometimes you just go with one and it's really a team decision between the creatives and the accountant. And I guess the more you know your client the easier it gets eventually to read them and anticipate how they're gonna react, etc.   Like supporting what the creatives wanted to do, question for ideas, getting things done on time. Well, they'd won awards, so. The whole game thing and it was with cell phones. There were these codes in the streets and as you take a picture of the code and send it to our base and they would get points. It was really complicated but exciting game for them to play, so I don't know if they could even research that beforehand.
