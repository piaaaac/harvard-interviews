Title: 75 BUENOS AIRES Unsuccessful Temaiken Zoo  Project in Travel/tourism industry

----

Text: T-E-M-A-I-K-E-N.  I believe that in one of the native dialects from the Indians in Argentina means Land of Life. It’s a zoo.  What happen is that they are all autochthonous animals and some in risk of extinction.  We did a campaign that was very successful with that client.  So you get an idea – it was very successful, the people that went to the zoo to the execution and suddenly they changed the manager and the next campaign was a torture.  The bounced back all the ideas.  That campaign was with cartoons and the next one e wanted to make it with drawings, to have it illustrated and he said no, that he didn’t like the one we had published. So when you have a new client and he tells you that everything you did isn’t any good, it’s hard to deal with. So that also generates frictions within the team because the account person who is with the client all the time, wants to stop fighting so he comes and ask you for things and you’re like, “There’s no way I am doing that.”  It’s hard because there are relations where the process gets very complicated.  It was awful. The bounced back all the ideas.

It was awful. Good in the beginning and then what I was telling you about started happening.  Logically, fights start appearing when the process starts getting more complicated.  You say, “You are an idiot, you can’t sell anything.  I’ll go.” Yes, I was telling you about the account people.  No, in general there is very rare to have – it can be that someone woke up in a bad mood one day and – it can happen to you, we all have bad days.  You wake up against the world, you want to fight everyone and that happens; but in general everything flows within our team.  The thing is that with we did have friction with the account people.  Not at the beginning but when the problem starts growing and there is always someone to blame.  “It’s you.” “No, it’s you.”  Nothing that couldn’t be resolved.

Yes, because one person can complicate the entire job even internally because the mood – imagine, you have presented many campaigns, you go and present again, and again, the third time they bounce it back you want to fight with the account person, with your team because you don’t know what else to say. Logically, fights start appearing when the process starts getting more complicated.  You say, “You are an idiot, you can’t sell anything.
