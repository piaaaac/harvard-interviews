Title: Unsuccessful HP project Project in Home goods industry

----

Text: Oh yeah. HP project. I mean, it went very well in the end, it did have a really nice final, it was [inaudible 00:31:15] program, and then overall I don't think unsuccessful project at all, I think it was very successful project. Simple product but it was like Phase 0, Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3. So it was really long, six months or seven months this project, and we spent almost two months to research in total organization of HP rather than get to the real customer. So, I think only that first phase was very, unsuccessful. Yeah. Because it was very hard to understand that whole weird politics side and then messing up the natural design. I don't think we figured it out very well. So how can we make these things, how can we make expensive one look more expensive, and how can we make cheaper one look more cheaper? But they're sharing qualities, thinking about the core technology, it's the same! I mean, the thing is, really the customer service is not really customer don't even [inaudible 00:32:53], it's more about distractions in your market strategy. So, we spend like one or two months, on just in this whole internal situation, in order to get to the customer. Actually, I don't think that anyone in HP can figure that out as well, because it is not something make it better or something make it right, it's all about it's touchpoint was just wrong. Yeah, so that part was very unsuccessful and unpleasant. Make it look like, just like good looking or like a market message or brand, can help them to be or look like [inaudible 00:35:43] or something like that. So, I don't know how other guys can deal with that, unless involved in the strategy side. So, I think although it's close to [inaudible 00:36:00] work, I think while I'm [inaudible 00:36:06] very slowly like, their blood or DNA cell is not really to somebody else, go back to [inaudible 00:36:17] and how can we improve this whole [inaudible 00:36:21] and how can have little [inaudible 00:36:26] like that. So, I do like my job. So how can we make these things, how can we make expensive one look more expensive, and how can we make cheaper one look more cheaper? But they're sharing qualities, thinking about the core technology, it's the same! I mean, the thing is, really the customer service is not really customer don't even [inaudible 00:32:53], it's more about distractions in your market strategy. So, we spend like one or two months, on just in this whole internal situation, in order to get to the customer. So, I think only that first phase was very, unsuccessful. Yeah. Because it was very hard to understand that whole weird politics side and then messing up the natural design. I don't think we figured it out very well. Because HP is big company, and they make tons of product, and internally they've got lots of political and stuff going on. And imagine you have printer engine, you have one single mechanical inside, but you have different cosmetic on there, and then you just add different gimmicks and then you sell all different prices. And internal market strategy. So, we give them pretty much right answer, but I don't think politically its good thing to do. But, if you had to say oh it's not right thing to do then, well you can do it that way, but it's not really make the world prettier.  So, let's say you're working at [inaudible 00:35:19]. So, [inaudible 00:35:19] was to be well-being company. But when you know this tool is not working at all, but you need to package it.
