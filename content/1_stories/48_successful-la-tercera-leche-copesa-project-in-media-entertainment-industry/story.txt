Title: Successful La Tercera (Leche)/COPESA Project in Media/Entertainment industry

----

Text: From there – a specific case was that in a moment we established that La Tercera would go after the truth. It would be the diary that told you the truth and everything went in that direction and we did beautiful campaigns. All institutional communication had to do with that and I looked at that after five of seven years and today it is Mercurio’s biggest competitor. Mercurio had to take down a lot of things. It has a lot more readers, we reached young people at that time and nowadays it’s a different paper. It’s a serious newspaper and everybody reads it. It’s a model. But what I like the most is that the construction started with the agency and of how you can reach people with creativity, and for me that has been my most complete case. More than a specific case it’s one that I always talk about when _________. I don’t know if this is useful for you. There are several. I have a project – I managed a paper in another agency called La Tercera and I got to take it when it was a bad diary, yellow press, yellow headlines, visually ugly. I got to go through all the story from the point when the client wanted to compete with – you know Chile – I want to compete with Mercurio, I want to be on that level. I lived that entire process during five years where I had a client and I really experienced really being a partner with the client. We had really good discussions. I think he understood that his road was creativity, and like you said, everything we did worked really well with what we wanted as a future brand. From there – a specific case was that in a moment we established that La Tercera would go after the truth. It would be the diary that told you the truth and everything went in that direction and we did beautiful campaigns. All institutional communication had to do with that and I looked at that after five of seven years and today it is Mercurio’s biggest competitor. Mercurio had to take down a lot of things. It has a lot more readers, we reached young people at that time and nowadays it’s a different paper. It’s a serious newspaper and everybody reads it. It’s a model. But what I like the most is that the construction started with the agency and of how you can reach people with creativity, and for me that has been my most complete case. More than a specific case it’s one that I always talk about when _________. I don’t know It was a directory that had – first we had a marketing manager, a general manager, the CEO was even in the important meetings and besides them two people more. But the quick decisions were made by two people. Yes. There were people working under them, of course, in order to do things quickly but yes. Two high level people and on bigger things like the campaign, all five of them would come. Yes, high. When you talk about people who are different – they would take – and it’s not that they felt they were taking a risk. They felt that there’s where the difference with Mercurio lay, speaking of ______. The exposure x piece will have in the media. How many times – if it’s a brand with a lot of money, I put the spot on TV and play it over and over. That’s a lot of GRB. There are brands like La Tercera, where they didn’t have a lot of money for their exposure so they understood that creativity was going to make the consumer pay attention to the message. It was going to get their attention because it had less plays than another brand that can play it and play it and the message gets in because of that repetition. In that sense they understood that it was better to have a media strategy. Few impacts but on shows that had a high rating and with a message that would catch people’s attention, and we build everything from there because we didn’t have a big budget in that sense. A context, a moment where things happened. But the most important thing for me was the team. The talent that they had. In terms of the relationships with them? No, it’s just that. It was an issue of trust, of trusting each other and respecting and saying, “Yes, you are right.” Sometimes it was arguing and explaining to the other side as well as accepting when we were wrong too. They were very good. I think they were above average because they didn’t just work, it also transformed into our social life, a team. I don’t know if that was very good in the end, but at that moment we did our best pieces and as a result La Tercera is what it is today. That team went everywhere together, we saw each other a lot and we also loved each other in the sense of respect. Yes, we didn’t have those old limits where – I saw that maybe because since it was more of a boutique, it had a lighter structure. At the beginning we tested until we stopped doing it because, as I tell you, it was a trusting relationship. “Oh, you are the experts, you understand…” And they understood that sometimes testing kills things with no sense at all. Too low. Institutional campaigns had normal budgets, but little GRB. Do you know what I mean by GRB? Several things. It happened that at that moment we had a very inspiring agency. Working at that agency, with that people, at that place where we worked. It happened that for a moment a lot of people who loved each other very much came together. There was a lot of young talent under us and one of those moments happened where for two years people that thought in a very similar way came together in that agency; we had a lot of ideas, the place was ideal, we had a very good relationship and I attribute that wonderful job to that because an ideal team came together. Very much a partner, very trusting in that we were the experts on this matter. That team went everywhere together, we saw each other a lot and we also loved each other in the sense of respect.
