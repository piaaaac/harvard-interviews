Text: Well, we were lucky, [inaudible 00:00:40] but we didn't have to deal with such, one of the ladies from Shanghai office was overseeing it. She's lovely. But, again, I think the conflict between Creative and Account Service comes from there being details coming from both sides and them having to deal with it in the middle, this, kind of, us having no input, so it was fine, she was really kind of just an admin role, I guess, saying this has to be done and this has to be done. The truth, how many times do you go to, like a milk bar or where you get something, you go to get a burger or something and you look at the foods they've got there and there's fifty different drinks, and you're like, fuck!   Difficult dealing with the photographer and re-touch up because they are in Singapore. Me and my partner can be very cheeky and sarcastic, just joking around, I doubt that just kind of [sound effect] a lot of the time, so we found ourselves, `no, we're joking, we're joking.` It was very funny. But that was quite tricky, especially when you scrutinize over the details and it goes back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. But I almost feel the need to sit in the room with someone and talk to them.
