Title: 79 BUENOS AIRES Successful Halls Crunchy/Cadbury Project in Confectionery/sweets/gum industry

Text: The video that explains, “Halls launches its new product.” That might be good to have the case, at least. The tolerance was high because obstacles come up during the process that have to do with the direction of the actor, in this case it wasn’t a cute guy. He had the virtue of doing a thousand things with his mouth, which was what the spot was about. So h wasn’t a cute guy, he wasn’t a typical advertising guy. He was sort of tan and over here people of a darker complexion are of lower socio-economic background. In fact, this guy lived in a very poor neighborhood of the city. So from accepting this person to be on TV and making a website with the costs and risks of doing something they had never done before. They didn’t even have an institutional website. They trusted us to do all this part which we had never done before, so their tolerance was very high regarding the work. We developed a very good relationship with them and they still ask us for a bunch of things, which they didn’t ask before. It was from this job on that they – the brand manager went up to regional manager and the executive manager went up to local manager. It meant an advancement in their career, as well; not 100 percent because of us, logically, but our work did help in the success process. So that’s why it was good; the risk was high and they handled it pretty well. The project was from medium to high. It wasn’t a very big budget but it wasn’t a budget that wouldn’t let you do anything. It was a medium to high budget; it was a good one. Yes, normal. If take the whole project into account, it developed in about three months. It was everything, from the moment we thought about the first spot to the moment it went on air and the activations and events took place in public spaces three months went by. Yes, narrow-minded. That. But it was very good. We started very well. All the presentations were very fun; meetings were very informal. That’s something we propose from the start of a meeting, to have something that is not as rigid. We say that we can have fun and do a good job at the same time. That’s why the meeting has to do with that, with doing a good job, having fun and making the process a good process leading to a good job. The example was – you can see that because the meetings were very fun, the shootings too, the web development happened very naturally and it was very fun. I can tell you today I had a meeting at Halls and I saw the brand manager who now is the regional manager, she is now pregnant, and I saw her and we hugged each other as if we were best friend. “How cute, you are having a baby.” It’s a very beautiful relationship that creates good results in the end. It’s not that it wouldn’t happen any other way, but at least the process was fun and I give the process a 100 positive evaluation because of that, because it was personally very beautiful to have worked with them and the result, beyond just business, it was good as well. _______. They trusted us to do all this part which we had never done before, so their tolerance was very high regarding the work. So the idea started from saying, “Well, what happens if we put someone like that with a candy and he starts chewing it and then sounds start coming out?” It was sort of playing with your mouth because the other Halls you couldn’t bite it, you could only suck on it. In this case you could chew it and you had some more freedom with – The relationship with the client was very good from the start. The client was someone very interesting, intelligent, open-minded. That was the brand manager. The one below that, the executive manager, was not as liberal, he was more – how do you say it?   That’s something we propose from the start of a meeting, to have something that is not as rigid. We say that we can have fun and do a good job at the same time. That’s why the meeting has to do with that, with doing a good job, having fun and making the process a good process leading to a good job. The example was – you can see that because the meetings were very fun, the shootings too, the web development happened very naturally and it was very fun. No, it does matter but at the moment when they have to talk to the client it becomes a complicated job from that place. They are the fuse between the creatives and the client, so they have to answer to both sides and sometimes they lose sight of the fact that they are working for JWT and not for Cadbury. So sometimes they think they are working more for Cadbury than from JWT.
