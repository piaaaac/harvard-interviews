Title: 197 JOHANNESBURG Unsuccessful Kellogg's Glycemic Index brochure Project in Food industry

----

Text: I have to say ... what was something that they changed it so much? Okay, yes. We did this project as well, it was going to be a very awesome brochure for Kelloggs, a GA brochure. Unfortunately, due to budget ... I wouldn't say budget, and I'd say client, it got cut, and it wasn't done anymore. I did a shit load of work for absolutely no reason, and that's how I'd say it was disappointing. It wasn't the fact that the work was disappointing, it was the fact that you do all this work, and it gets cut down and you don't get to produce it, which is very, very disappointing. So, I'd say that's a disappointment. No. Well, it was supposed to be this huge launch of it in South Africa, and they made such a big deal about it. Then suddenly they just canned everything. So, it was supposed to be a big brief, but it turned out that they made it into a small brief. No, we were going to make a stunning brochure that was going to twirl and stuff, so I would have said the risk factor was quite ... they were willing to take a risk on it, definitely. I'd say medium, not like in they willing to blow the [inaudible 00:26:20], because it never happened, but at first they were very excited, and then they canned it, which sucks. I was looking at a way ... it's a lot of information to put on one brochure. I was thinking of how could we make it fun and interactive, yet informative. I think that's what inspired me, is the trying to appeal to people, but with so much crap of information, with so much information. So, I'd say that inspired me, and also some ... obviously looking at how you can make a brochure fun. Usually a brochure is a piece of paper. Good, as in, good relationship, but in the end it got canned. So, I wouldn't say it affected the relationship, so I'd say good. Money.   It wasn't the fact that the work was disappointing, it was the fact that you do all this work, and it gets cut down and you don't get to produce it, which is very, very disappointing. So, I'd say that's a disappointment. I also think that the priorities were different, and that their priority wasn't on this, although it should have been. That's how I think it got canned. Because it's an understanding. They didn't have money. We just sucked it up, shed our two tears, and walked out the door. I think it was because there were so many people working on it, and so many people having to make decisions, that it's starting becoming this, `Okay, no, no, no. It's important for me. No, no, no. It's important for you. No, no, no, no, no. We need ...` and then, I think, through too many people in charge, having too many people in charge, it fucked up that way.
