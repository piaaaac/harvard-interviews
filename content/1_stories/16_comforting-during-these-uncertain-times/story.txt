Title: Comforting during these uncertain times

----

Text: My family have always loved home-baking, it is a great way to bring families together, it has always been this way. During lockdown there has been notable shortages of certain ingredients at the supermarkets, forcing us to get creative with what we make. Particularly, we have struggled to get yeast and bread flour. Our neighbour had created a sourdough starter and gave us a jar, it has been a great addition to our kitchen. I love the idea that we will always have a readily available source from which to make bread. The sourdough starter has really expanded our horizons in home-baking, showing us, you can make just about anything that we would previously have bought the mass-produced version from the supermarket. We have made delicious fresh bread, bagels, cinnamon rolls and fruitcake. Knowing that our food has been made with humble hands in our own kitchen is so comforting during these uncertain times.
