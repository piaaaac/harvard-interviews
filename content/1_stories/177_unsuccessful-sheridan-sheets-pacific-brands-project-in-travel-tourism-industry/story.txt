----

Text: Probably a Sheridan TV ad that we did. It was kind of set up as a big potential, big creative opportunity, we did hundreds of scripts, all really good, taking the brand in new directions, which is what they wanted, because they were doing a huge launch. It ended up that there was [inaudible 00:07:35] to the brand manager, that knew what he wanted right from the beginning, so there was really no point in us doing all of that work because he just kind of came up with the idea and said do it. In the end, we didn't have very much creativity at all, no freedom, we made it the best that we could, but it was a lot of hard work, like a good three months of just ideas and concepts and big brand and then it ended up [inaudible 00:08:09] he wanted. It was pretty disappointing.

It was pretty disappointing. The brief is good, the proposition that it started with didn't end up being, it was kind of one of those ones where you get discouraged [inaudible 00:09:17] you work to that and you are [inaudible 00:09:21] all year, ideas are on brief but really, it's not what they want. We kind of went away from the brief, to be honest, once we had a chat to the client and they told us what they really wanted, the brief didn't really exist anymore. That was quite annoying too. d. They thought they were giving us freedom, but really they were just squeezing us into one little box and we couldn't really get out of it, so we kind of had to do what they wanted. It did cause a bit of friction creatively, because there were ideas on the table that were much more creative and could have taken the brand places, but they were kind of ignored. They were going through a lot of changes management wise and there was a lot of pressure on them for this campaign and they kind of took that out on us and just were really, really prescriptive on what they wanted. They thought they were giving us freedom, but really they were just squeezing us into one little box and we couldn't really get out of it, so we kind of had to do what they wanted.

The idea wasn't exactly a mind blowing creative idea, but we tried to make it as beautiful looking as we could. Working really closely with the director and everything, we just tried to salvage what we could and make it as good as we could.

Not great, because they were quite a new client, we didn't really have any established trust or anything. There was a little friction, because they kind of got slapped on the wrists saying we need to just keep this client happy and so they were a lot of pressure on them and they kind of put that down on us as well, we kind of were fighting with internal and client for a lot of it, so it was hard.
