Text: And we'd written this spot ... which we felt was really good and then, client had a problem with it and they wanted it changed- the ending? I'm just- First thing I can think of now. It's not a major thing. I mean, but it's just maybe an example of how things can, in my eyes anyway, go a bit wrong for no reason. It went backwards and forwards quite a bit, like the spot was in a- We kind of had PeeWee [inaudible 00:40:30] at the beginning but near at the end, `Are we summing it up or whatever? We're not like totally convinced and stuff`. The arguments that they had, what they wanted to do, it was almost like explaining- Like, we kind of wanted to lead it in the listeners mind like `fill in the blank` kind of thing whereas they just wanted to spell it out, you know, spell out what we're trying to say. That just became so dumbed down for us and it was like- And we fought about it for awhile and backwards and forwards and try to do it a different way but not their way. It went back and forth, back and forth. From then, we just said it's actually not worth it. Let's just finish it up because we have to record like, tomorrow or whatever and it just- Yeah. So, I think that's a very frustrating thing that sometimes happens for me, especially because I love radio so much and like hear about it and stuff. You want it to be right 'cause the thing- You're gonna hear it yourself on the radio and then when you hear it and it's not right, then it flippin' irritates you and it's like ... so. That was a big thing and that came from- And that I can't explain to you why that happens. I seriously, I mean- among ourselves, we've got like this `This client is just flippin' stupid` and like `They're never gonna get it` and I don't know how to explain it to them that they get it. It's kind of a way we feel, that they should trust us because we're supposed to specializing in this and like, it's communication. It's like, we're not there to spell everything out to people. We're there to involve them and to reward them for listening to our radio ads so ... it's like `Ah, I get it` you know? That's kind of what you're looking for. You just get clients- and this happens a lot, it's not just this client- where they don't get that. They just don't [inaudible 00:42:17] but no, you must tell them. Tell them what we've got to offer them and whatever. You gotta be more subtle than that. You gotta be like, kind of, trust that they've got a few brain cells and they can work it out for themselves, you know, 'cause then they feel like `Oh!` They feel involved in this thing and like, you know, for us it's kinda like basics. That's like 101 that they teach you. Don't complete the circle for the public, or for the listener or the viewer or whatever. Just leave something so that he finishes the thing. So, it's that kinda thing that kind of happens and ... I can't explain why. It's like you'll get a client who's just like dead set and they're just like `No. We want to say this and we will say this and then that's it.` That's the best example that I can think of right now You gotta be more subtle than that. You gotta be like, kind of, trust that they've got a few brain cells and they can work it out for themselves, you know, 'cause then they feel like `Oh!` They feel involved in this thing and like, you know, for us it's kinda like basics. That's like 101 that they teach you. Don't complete the circle for the public, or for the listener or the viewer or whatever. Just leave something so that he finishes the thing. So, it's that kinda thing that kind of happens and ... I can't explain why. It's like you'll get a client who's just like dead set and they're just like `No. We want to say this and we will say this and then that's it.` That's the best example that I can think of right now. And it ruins it, yeah. Especially when we get the opportunity to do nice radio and creative radio and they don't get it. That's kind of frustrating. We don't really handle- I mean, we kind of argue in words with client service. 'cause they have the liaison. They will go and speak to- We never actually speak to the client. Well, rarely actually speak to them about it. Client service would come back to us and say `Your client says they don't get this, they won't say this and this` and we'll have a little, like `No, but you gotta explain to them that this is what we're doing. This is what we're saying. This is why we're saying it like this.` That's where diplomacy comes in, where you've seriously- and I've got a lot of resect for them, that they have to do that ... the client service, go back and- be the middle man between this whole thing 'cause it's not easy. You gotta kind of, then, go back to them- to the client- and kind of ... it's all about diplomacy I think really. You don't wanna- it's such a fine line between dissing them, like making them feel stupid or whatever, and convincing them that what we're trying to do is the best thing for them. It's kind of in their interest to do this way and not that way. So ... like I said, we don't personally- We, to the best of our ability, try to explain the reasons, like `Step 1, 2, 3` or whatever, to client service and `Okay, look. This is what you're saying their problem is. This is why we've done it this way. This is why we think their way is gonna detract from this way` and ... Maybe their option seed is like `Okay. We can take what they've said and kind of try and implement it or we can change it slightly or whatever` but kind of, I think- The feeling at the end that we try to get back to the client is that we're really working hard to make it the best for this job for you. It's not because we're trying to be funny or whatever. This is what you're paying us to do. You're paying us to sell this product or do this thing. Let us do our job basically. So, yeah, but that is, I think ... It's probably the most frustrating thing for all of us and ... but it's part of life, you know. ... that would be ... I know who it was but it would've been one person 'cause it was ... a very hard-headed person. They got, yeah- but it's also they got involved in the details. I mean, they were happy with a thing- like the script and whatever. Then they got involved in like the little details- At the ... giving it back to them, yeah. As for the brief, they weren't still happy until they got the script. Then they saw like one little detail and they were like ... freaking. Then it was a bit of back and forth and created options. I think, like, various different options of what we can do now after hearing what the problem was. We tried to- We went back with, I think, three or four different options to the same script and just changing- No no no. We pushed for- We gave the options back like kind of, fiddling with it and [inaudible 00:49:34]. We still backed our original one the whole way through but then we would say `Okay, if not that then maybe this` or whatever. It kind of went back and forth and we said `No, maybe try this, maybe-` it kind of went like that for awhile. They kept changing their minds as well, you know, like `Eh ...` or they would send one back and say `No, no. We've thought about it again. Like, maybe we should say this at the end` or whatever. So through that process, we kept fighting for what we believed in until, like I said, at the end it just became a time issue where it's like `Well, we gotta go and record this thing now.` Actually, we were sitting downstairs in client service, when client service- The person when Rachel came back again and said like `[Brian 00:50:18] does not sit ... this again` and I just said `Okay, that's it.` I'm all for fighting for stuff or whatever but it was just like, whatever you can't try and explain something so many times. Oh yeah, yeah. Just like- Flip, you know, 'cause- it's also, the thing is that we were going- especially since Doug let- we just, we've gone into this time where it's ridiculously busy. So we constantly juggling ten jobs or whatever and this thing keeps coming back and keeps coming back and whatever. It was just like `We don't need this right now. We've tried! We really tried but it's gotta go.` I think client service kept it quite- I mean, we were kind of ... but that's why we never speak to them- Rarely and from my ... I was getting angry or just like, you know, just please get this thing done so we can get on with it. I think client service kind of just shields them from all of that. They never see that or they never ... so I think that the relationship was pretty good. I mean, they just saw this like ... conversation or whatever. I don't know. The radio one. With accounts, it was fine. It was like ... you know, we discussed the problem. I mean, she was the liaison personnel [inaudible 00:53:25] and ... she always saw our point, which is good. She understood what we meant and kind of went back to client and try to explain it to them as best as possible. So, yeah. I think that relationship was- I mean that's quite enough normally how it goes, you know. Whenever there's ... you know, we kind of communicate internally and she was always there, she always understood and she always went back and tried something. That's all you can ask so ...   Strategy was good. [Russell 00:54:00] ... Yeah. Relationship very good, Russell's brilliant. He gave us all the right stuff that we needed and whatever and ... Yeah. No, strategy's always- since I've been here- we've had two strategy guys and they're both really brilliant.
