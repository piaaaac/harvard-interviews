Title: We share seed

----

Text: It’s a really cultural thing in the West Highlands this way of doing it (planting potatoes in ridges with seaweed). And in Ireland the Gaelic word for potatoes is buntàta = tatties. It’s done using seaweed which makes the potatoes nutritionally denser. They are very old, these ridges I mean. These were made by the old guys near me a long time ago, but made using the same method. In the village, we share seed. I’m delivering some today actually to three other crofters. The type I’m sowing in the video is the Lumper, the type that failed in the famine.
