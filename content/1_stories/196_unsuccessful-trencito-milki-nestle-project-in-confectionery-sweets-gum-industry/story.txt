Title: Unsuccessful Trencito Milki/Nestle Project in Confectionery/sweets/gum industry

----

Text: No, it was a launch. I love the commercial. It’s my first commercial and I love it and I think it’s the most fun thing around. But the process was terrible. I hated it. We presented 30 scripts. 30. We were working for three months and we had to go and make the commercial in one week because it had to be on-air right away. Everything was a rush, everything was terrible, everything was ultra-tested, we had a bad relationship with the testing agency, so they tested everything wrong. The questions that – I would go to the tests and accounts would go with us and the creatives did as well and we would see that they liked the commercial and they would say, “No, but in reality they really don’t like it.” “But they are saying they love it.” “No, but it’s not what they say because you then psychologically analyze what they are saying…” It was all wrong. . The brand manager of Trencito is incredible. His vision is like this, 360 degrees and the guy is incredible but his boss is tragic. So we couldn’t move forward and we tried to sell the idea and then – in one of the meetings when we were on script number 15, for example, he said that we would come up with commercials and just stuck the product on the back, like with a bubble gum. So that is very insulting for us because you take the product as the starting point. So the second time he said something like that I got really mad. The brand manager of Trencito is incredible.

I love the commercial, but I think that Nestle has a very archaic vision of advertising. You see the reel of Nestle commercials and they are all the same; they are very pretty and the entire family is happy and it’s perfect. It’s about perfect couples and perfect children. For them kids never rode a bus, never touched the subway, and they do millions of tests and then they don’t care about them. I think they are very scared of innovation and for example the client in particular – the brand manager of Trencito because Trencito is a chocolate that takes this new version of Trencito Milky.

So that is very insulting for us because you take the product as the starting point. So the second time he said something like that I got really mad. He’s the sort of people that don’t give a personality to the brand. They want to see the giant product because the product is gigantic and otherwise people won’t see it. For example, he once told us, “Do you know what? What I want for the commercial is to have a group of kids at a plaza who are talking about how incredible the chocolate is.” So that’s the commercial he wanted to have. The degree of frustration with that project was incredibly high. Having presented 30 scripts of which, by the end of the process, only one was approved and the boss said, “No, I don’t think kids will like this.” “But we tested it.” “Yes, but I don’t think they will understand it.” “But we tested it; they loved it and understood it.” “No, I will think they wont.” None. It was terrible. “You might like…” “No.” They budget was – it’s complicated because I think they gave us a lot of time but the decisions were taken – I mean I think we had six months to work on the commercial but out of that we spent five months thinking because they didn’t approve anything, so in the end you look like a failure because you can’t present something that is logical. I don’t think any of the commercials we presented was something that I wouldn’t have liked to see on TV. So I think that the time they gave us was good but it was very badly distributed. I can tell you that script number 30 inspired us. What inspired us? I think there came a point where we didn’t know what to do. We had ideas for everything. I am telling you that we presented 30 scripts but those 30 scripts came from 90 ideas before Experience. Something very personal for me, I am the oldest of all my cousins and I have all very young cousins. I think I went to their houses every weekend to see what they did, how they moved, just to get an idea. I think that we read a lot or at least I read a lot of planning studies because Nestle does a lot of children studies and I think that we got a lot of ideas from that about how the moved, the environment where they moved, what they were thinking, what they liked, what they didn’t like, why there was a commercial they hated and why there was another one that they liked a lot. We were very careful with that because, for example, we discovered that they are very critical so that in half of the commercials they try to put a character that looks cool and has that cool stereotype, sort of a jockey with ultra big sneakers and uses a skateboard, and it’s not like that. The little kid cannot relate to that, so discovering who was really that kid in the class and remember ourselves when we were in school, but trying to get there in those studies and in our own experience. We also went to the streets. I remember that by the end of the project it was impossible to be in a room in here and we would take the entire afternoon and go to Providencia for a cup of coffee and just observe, “What if we do this? And if we do this other thing?” And we would see the kids go by and we tried to do those things because it wasn’t flowing anymore. I think we got along very well with the brand manager. I think that the other one has a certain personality where he needs to impose himself. Do you know what? He’s that type of people that has to see the negative in everything. It’s not that they are really wrong, but in order to impose his authority they have to be wrong. That’s my perception, of course. So he didn’t justify – his vision was very subjective and that is very complicated for the relationship because we tried to be very objective beyond us liking the ideas, we showed him references and everything and he understood but he was very subjective. So by being subjective he didn’t give us space to respond because in the end in came down to “I like it” or “I don’t like it because I like it or because I don’t like it.” There wasn’t any other answer. So with him it was a very complicated relationship, with the brand manager, Felipe, nothing, perfect. I think that the relationship with accounts was very hard because I think that the client was pressuring them a lot to have the project done, therefore account pressured us a lot and there are things that you can’t rush. If they are asking you all day long about what the new script is, you’re like, “I have presented 10 scripts and I need to go somewhere else to think because I can’t think of anything.” And they were like, “What do you mean that you can’t think of anything.” So it was a very tense – “No, but it’s not what they say because you then psychologically analyze what they are saying…” It was all wrong.

What I want of r the commercial is to have a group of kids at a plaza who are talking about how incredible the chocolate is.” So that’s the commercial he wanted to have ittle kids – and we made him a commercial like that with little kids talking and they said, “Hey, have you seen the new generations?” And the other one would say, “Yes, and now they go online and play on the Internet. In my time I would play ball.” They were little kids talking, “Yes, have you seen that now instead of drinking their milk they eat it?” Because it’s solid milk, so the other one says, “Yes, I don’t know what we are coming to.” So it wasn’t as boring but because it was a little shinny and the product is not…” We felt like hitting ourselves in the head with a bat. he degree of frustration with that project was incredibly high. Having presented 30 scripts of which, by the end of the process, only one was approved and the boss said, “No, I don’t think kids will like this.” “But we tested it.” “Yes, but I don’t think they will understand it.” “But we tested it; they loved it and understood it.” “No, I will think they wont.” “But we tested it.” “Yes, but I don’t think they will understand it.” “But we tested it; they loved it and understood it.” “No, I will think they wont.” He said, “No, I don’t think they’ll like it. They won’t like it.” “We tested it.” “No, no.” “But we have all the graphics.” “No, they won’t.” What can you do? None. No risk-tolerance at all. Zero. I mean I think we had six months to work on the commercial but out of that we spent five months thinking because they didn’t approve anything, so in the end you look like a failure because you can’t present something that is logical.

So with him it was a very complicated relationship  Good. I think that there were a lot of contributions that helped us move ahead with the project because then it all was done in a rush and we needed the support from the entire team, much more than just the partners. We needed everybody to get in on it because we needed to support that particular project that week, and we all went to the shooting of the commercial and we had a great time. It was very fun. “I have presented 10 scripts and I need to go somewhere else to think because I can’t think of anything.” And they were like, “What do you mean that you can’t think of anything.” So it was a very tense –
