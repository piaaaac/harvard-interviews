Title: 118 SYDNEY Unsuccessful Kellogg's Sunny Bright Project in Food industry

----

Text: We just put in work for it for like nine months, and they loved it. They loved the idea from the beginning, making sure of the presentation, we had the room designed to get them in the mood for it and everything. It's about a bar, kind of blokes, kind of boys to men thing going on. Guys who really don't care about getting their feed, getting their meal. So it's like blokes on the go, men on the run eat this bar, we don't really care what's in it, we just eat it because we're men. So it's going to be funny. So we did this whole thing about headlines, like you know, it was really funny headlines, real blunt headlines like, `Food, 10 out of 10 doctors recommend it`, and some other stupid kind of stuff, it was really funny. Like the kind of stuff that kids would find funny, teenagers. Yeah, the media people didn't book their media properly, the account planning didn't fill us in. They must have known as well, they did know, they just didn't tell us to stop working on it, so we did that all good. So yeah, that department should've been communicating with us more I'd say. Media should've been communicating with them more, or with us more, and the client should've been telling us also, from the get go, that, `We didn't have a media space for it, sorry`. Instead of us spending a thousand hours developing it, which is pretty silly. Because it would've been really interesting for Kellogg's, like Kleenex-y kind of thing. It would've been really different for them. At the end of the day it was just a series of posters that was going to be run and billboards and stuff. But the brand hasn't been advertised before, Sunny Bright, so this would've been their first launch. So I'm just saying, it's a big deal, but it's not T.V. or anything, it was only posters. Was better than ... it wasn't that good, but it was okay. There was just a bit of lack of communication going on. And they loved it, and then we were off making it, hundreds of different headlines and posters. Because they're very headline driven we had to design them really nicely, so we got a really good designer on board, making them and then they just canceled it. They said, `sorry, the media isn't happening this year`, and they canceled it. And then, they did it again three months later, they said, `No, it's back on, let's get ready again`. And then they said, `No, we want a new direction`. We went a new direction again, and then they went, `Oops, sorry, can't do it anymore`. So that was just pretty like, `What the hell?`. Media should've been communicating with them more, or with us more, and the client should've been telling us also, from the get go, that, `We didn't have a media space for it, sorry`. Instead of us spending a thousand hours developing it, which is pretty silly.   Whereas most Kellogg's things don't reek opportunities, there's really stunk of opportunity, we could do something really fun with it.  There was just a bit of lack of communication going on.
