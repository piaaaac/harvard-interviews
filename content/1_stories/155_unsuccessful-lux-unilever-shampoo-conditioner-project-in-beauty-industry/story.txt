Title: Unsuccessful Lux/Unilever (shampoo + conditioner) Project in Beauty industry

----

Text: There is a few. Right when I came in, my team was working on a project for Lux. It was during a time when Unilever was trying to change the image of Lux. They were trying to move away from the more gossip magazine, more into the very glamorous, they were trying to move away from the stardom of Lux. Unilever won't quite sure of what they wanted. We weren't quite sure of what they wanted. We had a huge project to handle. It was back and forth all the time. We were getting some very vague feedback from them. We weren't able to develop based on those feedbacks. Communication was very bad. We worked on this project for I don't know maybe three months. When it was almost ready they pulled out the project. We never managed to actually hand it in. No, it was for three kinds of shampoo for repairing colored hair. We were asked to do two TV series. One for shampoo, one of conditioner. The brief asked us to target each color separately in the ad. We had red, black, and brown. That was the brief. Yeah, very ... They introduced something new in this brief. They wanted to have magical reality in the ad, but it wasn't very well explained what they meant by that. At the beginning when the brief came in we were having some good ideas as you usually do when a brief comes in. You usually go a bit crazy on it waiting for feedback. Then, every time we went back with something, they just completely changed everything, or asked us to change everything. By the end of it we had something completely manufactured. It was very bad. At that time very bad. The communication just wasn't there. Still good. We still worked well, yeah, considering that the morale was a bit low. Yeah. I mean account service, we have to understand they have a hard job trying to please the client and at the same time trying to deliver the blows in the soft way to us. It was a bit touch and go. First better communication between client and the agency, not just the creative department but the account servicing as well. We didn't get a clear brief. They should have gone back to client and made sure that the brief was very specific. Also, I don't know, maybe a bit of creative training with the client. We've been trying to do this for ages, trying to get them into a little creative training, creative workshop because I mean, they don't understand what the creative process is. For them it's a switch that you switch on and off and you come up with as many ideas as you want. It was back and forth all the time. We were getting some very vague feedback from them. We weren't able to develop based on those feedbacks. Communication was very bad. We worked on this project for I don't know maybe three months. When it was almost ready they pulled out the project. We never managed to actually hand it in. They introduced something new in this brief. They wanted to have magical reality in the ad, but it wasn't very well explained what they meant by that. I think it wasn't just a problem with that brief. There was problems before. In that particular brief, the communication just wasn't there. The feedback we were getting was not specific enough. They weren't happy. We weren't happy. It wasn't working very well. Same I think. Yeah, I think planning wasn't really understanding what the client wanted as well, so it wasn't getting well translated to us.  First better communication between client and the agency, not just the creative department but the account servicing as well. We didn't get a clear brief. They should have gone back to client and made sure that the brief was very specific.
