Title: 219 LONDON Successful UBS (embedded) Project in Financial industry

----

Text: Interestingly enough, the first project with that bank, it's funny because it was a very high manager in the bank said, `I'm interested in innovation, and I'm interested in our bank becoming more innovative.` IDEO usually says, ` Great, we can help you become more innovative.` There, I've stopped saying innovative. Anyway, `We can help you do that. The best way to do that is to start with a project as an example. Let's do a piece of work to show you how our process works, how we are innovative, and how it could be relative to you, and then we can start thinking about changing your organization to be that way.` We did this project on credit cards with them. There was a very high-level sponsor who was keen about IDEO, keen about innovation, and keen to try the project on credit cards. They're the ones who selected it. Meanwhile, the credit card guys, down several levels in the organization, were kind of like, `What's going on here? Why are you bringing in a consultant? I'm doing my job just fine. We're making lots of money. We're successful. Why are you having someone come and innovate my area?` And so in fact, they were quite passive-aggressive and negative clients, come to think of it, in terms of being supportive of our work, or giving us research information, that kind of thing.

The project ended up being, I think, quite successful and unique, because we were able to come up with something that was very, very different. It was interesting, because they wanted us to be disruptive. I've learned since then that the word disruptive in a banking or a business context is not necessarily good. Disrupting a market is, I guess, good, if you are the disruptor, and you're well prepared to do it, but it's hard if the disruption is actually to your systems or if the disruption isn't quite ... I mean, if you were one of the established players in a market, disrupting the market isn't necessarily very good, absolutely, and so we learned a little bit about that, but we basically came up with this unique idea, and to a layperson, it doesn't sound that unique, but to the Swiss market, it was pretty interesting. Because of our relationship with the higher level management, we were able to get them to commit to trying it out in a market, in the market. It's been really successful that way, in that normally, they would have analyzed this new idea and said, `We don't have enough data because it's so different than everything else, so we can't actually analyze it. Therefore, we can't create a business case. Therefore, we can't do anything about this. Therefore, thank you very much for your work, IDEO, but we're going to put this on a shelf.` Because of our relationship with the higher level people and the sponsor, basically, for the project, we were able to get some traction, and they were able to try things in a different way, and say, `Okay, they have no precedent for this kind of thing. We can't make a business case. We're a bank. We usually only make business cases to do projects. We're going to try things differently.` It was a big organizational lesson, a big process lesson, that kind of thing, and it's in process. I think the hard part is this stuff takes a very long time. It took us 12 weeks to come up with the idea and present it quite nicely, and then it takes a year and a half to put it into a pilot, a test market, where 300 people try it out, because a banking product is unique in that it's not quite like, `Oh, here's a piece of technology. We've made a prototype of this recording device. We'll give it to 100 students and see how it goes.` It's more like, if it's a banking product, it has to actually work. A credit card has to work in every machine in the world, and it has to be a real credit card, so prototyping, or piloting something like that, is quite a lot more traumatic than you first think. That's been an example of something that's been quite successful. Then of course, that project has snowballed into other projects with the same client, and because we're little by little learning about different parts of their organization, we've had a lot of success that way. The other project we've done with the same organization is on their customer service experience, basically. That has been very different in the kind of project it is, because it's about a one-on-one service that you provide. As you can imagine, with any organization, especially a large bank, if you are providing a one-on-one service, and you have thousands of employees, and hundreds of thousands of customers, the number of one-on-one types of service that people get is millions of different kinds of experiences, and trying to design a consistent experience, or trying to design a conversation between people, which is essentially what it's coming down to, is how do you get trust with your client or customer? It's a very abstract problem to try to design, actually. What we learned with this project is that fundamentally, the whole bank needs to decide, `We're going to start to treat our customers in a different way, and we're going to try to meet their needs in this new way, and we've all decided to do this, and here are the way we're going to try to do it.` That would be the truly most successful outcome of that project, would have been, the whole bank says, `Hey, we've got a whole new way of talking and listening to our customers,` but in fact, that kind of initiative, that would be a pretty big deal for a very large bank to take on, everything from their outward-facing advertising down to how do their employees interact with their customers? Most organizations have undergone other initiatives like that, and also the market, in case you haven't been aware in the last couple years, has not been very good for banks, and so for them to focus on something other than the fact that the world's finances are going down the toilet No, I think they've been generally very successful, given the constraints. I mean, like with the customer service project with UBS, I mean, UBS is at the top of the list of banks that were in trouble for a while, and getting a lot of negative press, and in fact, still the most profitable bank in the world, but still getting a lot of negative press with the credit crunch and that kind of thing. The other thing that could be interesting that probably not a lot of people have talked to you about with UBS is that all along, all of our work with them, there's been this underlying interest in how do they become more innovative as an organization, and the problem is that banks are fundamentally not that innovative. They're about conservatism, especially a Swiss bank. It's about privacy and conservatism, and control, and innovation requires openness and things out of your control a little bit, and trying things before you know if they're successful. All of the attitudes about being creative are not very Swiss bank, basically. The overlap between those two is not big. All along they've been interested in being more innovative, and so all along we've learned from this series of projects about how they conduct their work and why they aren't creative like we are, because they are so driven by numbers. They're so driven by presumptions around numbers and business cases, and that kind of thing, and they don't really know how to quantify people needs and people attitudes and that kind of thing. Yeah, they do bring in people into the equation, but they use typical, traditional quantitative market research, where they try to take all of the nuances and complexities of people and turn them into statistics. `33.5% of people said that they might somewhat be more interested in investing more money, or would be interested in this kind of new credit card or that kind of new thing as well.` Well, the credit card project, let's see, here it was just a core team of four, and in terms of decision-makers, I guess just me as the project leader. When it comes down to it, the project manager is effectively making a lot of the decisions. Now I'm in the practice, so you can go to the practice for questions or support or guidance, if things are going wrong, but in general, you can take their advice or not. That sounds quite extreme, but that was a successful project, and the practice was very supportive, and so everything was going well, and nobody disagreed, so I guess in terms of decision-making, everybody was sort of in line with tone decision that we were making Well, the credit card project, let's see, here it was just a core team of four, and in terms of decision-makers, I guess just me as the project leader.

Then with the client's side, we always had a very clear sponsor, the person who's paying for the work, but then underneath that was the group who was responsible for implementing credit cards, who didn't really feel comfortable that we were on their turf. I'd say that they weren't the official decision-maker on our project, but they would have a lot of influence, so I'm not quite sure exactly how you'd divide that. I mean, if somebody very senior says, `Thou shalt try this new credit card,` they would be like, `Sure, okay,` but in a real passive-aggressive kind of, `We're not going to put too many resources on it. We're not really going to provide you with any real data. We're not going to help you help us.` They can make a decision which is taken by somebody else not successful because they don't want to participate or collaborate. There were too many people who disagreed with the direction of that project, and so there was a lot of conflict in house. I haven't talked too much about that. I'm sure somebody else has, but there was a bit of conflict on that project internally at IDEO because it was very fuzzy. It wasn't really clear what we were going to deliver. The project manager tends to work in a very abstract, fuzzy, `The answer will come at some point,` kind of way, and then the other senior people on the project wanted to work in a more rigorous sort of, `Let's figure out what we need to get done and when,` kind of way, and those personalities clashed quite significantly on the project. I'm a huge fan of the embedded team member. They're difficult. They're a pain in the rear. They require a lot of hand-holding, especially at the beginning, and then especially at the end, when they were sort of mentally checking out from the project, but in the middle, I think they're one of the reasons our relationship with UBS has been as successful as it has been, because they, one-on-one, were able to see what it is that we do and how much passion we bring to the project work, and how we are working really collaboratively and strategically to help them be successful. And so in fact, they were quite passive-aggressive and negative clients, come to think of it, in terms of being supportive of our work, or giving us research information, that kind of thing. `What's going on here? Why are you bringing in a consultant? I'm doing my job just fine. We're making lots of money. We're successful.
