Title: 140 SINGAPORE Unsuccessful Real estate office building Project in Building/construction industry

Text: Well, I can think of one, again, in recent memory and without getting into the agency. There just wasn't enough time given to us on that project. We were given just three days to do a major campaign. And the brief was not bad, it was reasonably good, as good as could be under the circumstances. But creative was not given enough time to flesh out the whole thing, and given the importance of that project as a pitch, they should have had more than one team on it. There was just one team and I was 50% of that team. We came up with something good enough, but I think we could have done more and better and perhaps and more ... No we did actually two different directions, but it would have been nicer to have had more than one team working on it, so that there could be more ideas and better ideas. And again, there was not enough brainstorming that happened on that. So it was on the other end of this other project that I talked about, that there were 15 people involved, 16 people involved, and here there were only three people involved. Obviously, and the time was not good enough in terms of three, four days to turn it around. So it was just me and the art director and the creative director and just three of us. And the creative director had his own things to do, so he was not there all the time, he was vetting and approving the broad ideas. So basically, just me and the art director we felt both pressured as well as not enough brainstorming and ideas, not enough people to bounce ideas off of. Well ... No because the agency didn't win the account, so it went to somebody else. Time was tight. Budget, there was really no budget to this because it depended on the idea, they would find the money for it. It was not lavish, it was enough to work with. And like I said, really there was no defined figure because it was a pitch in the campaign. It all depended on the idea. Well, there was not much time or room for inspiration because we just had to get on with our job. So I think it was just myself and the art director and the creative director sitting together and brainstorming. Of course, we did have a couple of meetings with the suits on as well, the downstairs people. But I think the brief would have been the single last source of inspiration in this case. And of course [inaudible 00:40:51] what was happening elsewhere in the market for property and everything else. Yeah. Basically there was no time to sit and get inspiration. In this case, honestly, I wouldn't know because I was not ... I think the client was a first-timer, we had not done anything for them before. Although they knew the agency, but I don't think the agency had done anything for them really, not at that point in time. But again, I did not have any direct meetings with the client. Because again, this was a freelance project I'd done. Normally, freelancers don't go and do presentations. Naturally, they are not fronted with a client because they are here today, may not be tomorrow. Yeah. And also ... I think one of the key things that we were told at the beginning of this project was ... It was implied, I guess, that there was not much confidence within the agency about that project, and the fact that we can't reverse. I think it was done because it needed to be done, for whatever political reasons that can appear [inaudible 00:42:25]. When I think back on it, it could have influenced us somewhat, knowing that our heart is not really into this piece of business, the agency saying that implicitly, not explicitly. And we are doing this presentation because we need to make a presentation.   No, I mean the relationships were good, the interaction was good. It's just that there was not much time to elicit or interact and develop it together as a team. There was a planner involved, and she had contributions to make. But again, we were all fighting for time.
