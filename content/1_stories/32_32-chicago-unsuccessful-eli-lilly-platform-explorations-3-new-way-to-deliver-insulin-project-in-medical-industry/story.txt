Text: Okay, so I want to be modest, I don't think that I have ... In my two years experience, I had like projects going bad, not going [inaudible 00:21:08]. I mean, having ... I think I had projects that met client needs, client expectations ... The very positive thing was, we provided a [inaudible 00:24:56] or a starting point from them to apply some of their market analysis. The bad thing is that, I think that, because of the breath of the project, because of complexity of the project, because of the moment, or the specific moment in the [inaudible 00:25:24], this project, this exploration was, I think not developed in a way that could really benefit the project itself. It was a good way to justify money, like to push money around because of there's X amount of money [inaudible 00:25:44] is investing with us or how we can, you know, make project ... it's money, so if not this, at the end of the fiscal year, will go at the end of the, outside the window, all this kind of things. The project could have been much more impactful, but and it ended up being good, but I think, I don't know how it's going to support and improve the actual final implementation. I think that's the biggest risk, especially when we have with big [inaudible 00:26:23] client, we're trying to be very strategic and we're trying to look at bigger pictures and sometimes we lose the importance of the detail, or the importance of how we can really be impactful, but this is very much a big conversation that comes up pretty often. I think it's because the type of projects we're doing is changing, and like for example, I think this Thursday is pretty well with a very good project that I believe we did is like, the two projects are back-to-back we did for Ford. It was, I mean, what IDEO has being doing for the past eight years is very, very risky, it's a lot of money they're investing. Risks tolerance, I would say very high, [inaudible 00:58:41] unexpectedly very high. That's been very much the core of our business, like a lot of ideas [inaudible 00:59:00] especially, like medical devices, and doing research and talking to people. I mean we have so much knowledge about the topic of diabetes. No, it was all right, I think that any kind of design work, or additional work that IDEO can do for Lilly, it's a good thing, so honestly, whatever we would have come up with, it would have been good for them, would be helpful. That's the problem, the fact that it was unfocused. No, I mean we forced ourselves to try ... again we forced ourselves to try to deliver something that would fit timeline of the bigger projects, so it could inform later phases of the bigger project. It was all about IDEO's effort in trying to constrain itself to be helpful for other IDEO's team member in a later phase, so very much important is the awareness of what is going on around, right, beside you project. Again users, and I think it's previous experiences, the history of the project, personal design and personal design opinions, but especially with those projects, with very longer, very big projects when basically, a lot of has been experimented, I think that the most important factor is being aware of all the works being down before. Inspiration would be do a thorough read and exploration and understanding of the previous work. To be aware how you can build on it and not to repeat something that has been before. Well, the client see all of them, but we agreed on a direction all together. It's very good, I mean, there's so much history and they're so used to see some of the faces involved in this project, I think. It's really [inaudible 01:03:54], but probably [inaudible 01:03:55] talk to Travis that now is owning the [inaudible 01:03:59] relationship and it is, you know, when you work together with a client for several years, it's good. I mean that actually, it's obvious like, let's try to make our life less complicated, that is already stressful, let's play nice, which there's no ... I don't think there's a hidden agenda, so it's pretty much everything on the plate because I think everybody recognizes the complexity and the difficulty of the work. Pretty uneventful, it was like okay, but it wasn't extremely passionate or it wasn't extremely exciting, pretty standard. It's like, `Okay, let's get the job done.` The bad thing is that, I think that, because of the breath of the project, because of complexity of the project, because of the moment, or the specific moment in the [inaudible 00:25:24], this project, this exploration was, I think not developed in a way that could really benefit the project itself. The project could have been much more impactful, but and it ended up being good, but I think, I don't know how it's going to support and improve the actual final implementation. we're trying to be very strategic and we're trying to look at bigger pictures and sometimes we lose the importance of the detail, or the importance of how we can really be impactful That's the problem, the fact that it was unfocused. It was all about IDEO's effort in trying to constrain itself to be helpful for other IDEO's team member in a later phase `Okay, let's get the job done.`   Okay, so I want to be modest, I don't think that I have ... In my two years experience, I had like projects going bad, Okay, because if I look in perspective, all the things that could have work well, it's because, either because of inexperience
