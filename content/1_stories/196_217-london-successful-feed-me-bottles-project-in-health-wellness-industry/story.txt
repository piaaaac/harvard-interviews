Text: And at that second one here, we showed them four different options in terms of design, building on what they told us in the first one and we deliberately had the same people come back in so that there was a continuity there. They could see the development. And then we just got their opinion on the positives and negatives of each one we showed them. And then we kind of took that [inaudible 00:17:30] that information down to get to the direction we actually end up in the end. Of course, with I suppose the outside ... if this is all user stuff, we also ... coming into it, we had other inspirations outside of just talking to the consumers like, what's good out there at the moment in that marketspace, but also in other marketspaces, so you don't have to just look in the marketspace you are actually designing for. You can get inspiration from other ones just as easily. I suppose one thing we do here, typically anyway, is the core team focused on one project at a time, so in this case, there was a few part-time team members, but their job was more going around working on multiple projects and reviewing and adding in. The core team were focusing on the one project, so you can get really deep embedded knowledge. We were experimenting with ways to kind of make it easier to work across multiple projects, 'cause I know a lot of other firms you'll see are working on multiple projects at a time. And that's something, historically, we haven't really done, because you get so in depth, you're like living in your space with your team. You kind of live that product or whatever you're designing for that many weeks. Cause the other projects, the one that I would say didn't go as well, was where, it was kind of even an experiment and I was working across two projects, for the same client. It was just two projects. That one I just felt like I never really, in the right space at the right time. I was kind felt like I was always catching up on things as it went along, so that was the one I probably didn't feel was as inspiration as it could have been 'cause I didn't feel I had the time really, to be inspired. Decision makers, well I suppose we all are on our side really. We also had one main client we were dealing with. But there was also three to four of his team as well, but it was really helpful 'cause he was obviously the main decision maker and the meetings where we had ... he was the one we were talking to the whole way through. The meetings were more like our opportunity to present and convince the others that this was the right direction and luckily we were on track a lot of the time. They were happy with how we were going. It was really one key decision maker, client side. And he was passing on the information of what we'd been doing to the rest of the guys. We just used the meetings if they were concerned about something, then we'd flag it up and we'd all work on it and make sure we're happy with the decision before we left the meeting. And then our side, I suppose what worked well in this team is ... 'cause we weren't, obviously we weren't all ... some of the people were doing this part-time alongside other things, because it was such a small project, we had to get such a lot done. There was several tracks of things happening at times, so for instance, there might be a business factors conversation happening with them meeting a client when I'm not there, even though I'm project managing because I have to do a design by the end of the day. There's the design element, then there was the engineering element, and these were kind of all happening together. And not all of us needed to be in all the conversations, as long as at certain points, we'd have a meeting, whether that'd be a physical meeting or email, to let everyone in the team know what was happening. If I hadn't been in this conversation, but then I had to have a meeting with the client, I still knew what had been said in that meeting. That means, we could be really productive in terms of the time, because everyone was really good about communicating in the project teams. It's really important in order for you to be able to kind of move forward quickly. I think that's what worked really well in this particular case. But the brief for this particular one was good type brief because partly down to the nature of the fact that they came to us with something and knew if they wanted a direction in terms of three different strategies, from where they came to us with. In that case, it wasn't like, `What's the future of blah.` It was like, `We've got this particular idea. We are convinced it's good and we want you to help us develop it.` Whereas some of the ones in the past, like for instance, some briefs totally change as well, like I'm working on the project a while ago. It's like, `We want a new packaging shape, box.` We were like, `Okay, well, that's fine but we don't really tend ... we tend to work on broader problems than just that.` And when we started looking into it, we realized that it wasn't necessary. They just needed a new shape, 'cause anyone ... you can put it in any shape. You need to have a reason as to why you use that shape, if it's gonna be a good idea. And we were saying, `Well, actually, what you need is, you need to position your brand slightly differently and create a new category for yourself within this particular aisle.` And so we kind of ... we gave them a new shape and everything, but we also backed it up with a lot of thinking about why this particular shape, why we think it's a good direction to move in and what they would also need to do with branding and communications in order to create the story. It was more, we think they need a new, a further in terms of helping push the brand, giving it a story, and showing that through a new packaging format, rather than just giving them a new shape. Do you see what I mean? Sometimes it's a bit more tricky. It was just iterative in terms of meetings, 'cause we don't really know ourselves until we've gone out and actually seen how things are working. We'll go out and once we've figured out that it's not quite exactly as we think ... basically you've got to all the time, think about what you think the client needs and then flag it up at the next available time, whether that's over a phone call, through the meeting lined up, you just say ... we kind of pave the way for it in a lot of the presentations anyway. And then obviously the client's got to agree that they think that's the right direction you've got to be moving in 'cause otherwise they'll be upset if they come in and at the very end isn't very collaborative with the clients in terms of if we feel the brief needs to slightly change in steering into a slightly different route than ... What inspired us? A combination of a lot of things, really. The user co-creation sessions were probably the biggest source of inspiration, but also the idea we were working with was a great idea, so that helped a lot. Yeah, just the team. The team was a great team on this one. We worked really well together, because we were different specialisms. Or like we'd, I don't know, go and get a few printouts and put on the table and go, `What do you think, guys?` And be like, `Okay, I like this one and this one. I like this one.` `Fine, make a decision and move on.` So, it was very kind of quick. It produced a lot of stuff very quickly. I think that allowed us to get much further down the path, much sooner, so we could spend a lot more time on the final direction that we gave them. Good. He was very supportive, very willing to hear our arguments for various things, to get us involved in all different conversations that were happening, really get in the meetings in terms of ... 'cause obviously he'd be our main contact so we'd keep him in the loop about everything and then he'd be telling his team, so he's very of us in the meetings and all along really. So, yeah it was a good client relationship. I was kind of joint ... 'cause basically, Suzy was also doing the engineering. She was kind of supporting me a bit, when basically there was weeks of high production, when I was very sucked into the design, she'd be there. She was basically leading the engineering conversation with him, 'cause he's much more experienced in that side of things as well and I know nothing about that side of things. Yeah, she was kind of helping doing the project management as well. I think it was very good. I mean I felt it was very good. You can ask Ben. I think you're speaking to him as well. I thought ... because we were doing this kind of track, doing everything, it was quite nice 'cause you kind of could feel it, so I think the design as well, it was more like working together is very much more like that. It's not really very hierarchal, however you say that. It's not like art director type role. It's much more like with it embedded in the team in terms of the design, so we'd work together. I suppose the main core difference with the project leadership role is that you've gotta know what's happening all at the same time and make sure that everyone understands what they have to be doing in that particular time so they feel productive, 'cause we were moving so quickly. But also, making sure that we did have ... that we were very good about talking about what was going on and what happened makes people feel confident that they know what's happened to them when they're put in a situation in front of the client, they can answer questions. I suppose it was a combination of good communication, all the time, even with people who weren't necessarily in the space with us all the time. Kind of relaxed working environment in terms of, I get on really well with both the guys who I was working with in terms of design. Anyway, very kind of relaxed, in terms of open to sharing ideas and being critical of them as well, like objective criticism, not taking offense if someone says, “Oh, I don't really like that.” Stuff like that. Also, I suppose the key difference with the leadership was also you're speaking ... you're the main point of contact for the client. Making sure that if there's issues, even if it's maybe not on your track that you're working on, that you can kind of talk to these guys and take that on board and then talk to the client and get back to them so that they feel like something's been done about it, so problems don't grate or where you ... they're brought to the attention of everyone. You can just deal with them as they come. I think if you do all that, then if it was like it's moving along and things are being dealt with rather than left to fester. And then have fun as well. Have a laugh. Have music on. We have things like Disney hour. Or requesting hour, where people ... we'd have the music on, the people in the project space next to us would request songs across the wall and we'd have to play them. So, just stuff like that make it fun while you're doing it. I think if you do all that, then if it was like it's moving along and things are being dealt with rather than left to fester. We went out initially, researched shops to understand the market. It was slightly different in this case. I don't know if it's the best example, if you're looking for idea generation tips because we were approached with a specific idea and asked to build on it And then, instead of doing more in home interviews, we then asked the users to come in to workshops that were kind of in the project, like those two milestones. And we basically, they were like co-creation sessions and with the users, They could see the development. And then we just got their opinion on the positives and negatives of each one we showed them. And then we kind of took that [inaudible 00:17:30] that information down to get to the direction we actually end up in the end. And that's something, historically, we haven't really done, because you get so in depth, you're like living in your space with your team. You kind of live that product or whatever you're designing for that many weeks. cause I didn't feel I had the time really, to be inspired. uckily we were on track a lot of the time. We just used the meetings if they were concerned about something, then we'd flag it up and we'd all work on it and make sure we're happy with the decision before we left the meeting. Well, he came to us with something ... he's kind of an inventor guy, so he's kind of able to describe that's what he wants. `Okay, well, that's fine but we don't really tend ... we tend to work on broader problems than just that.` And when we started looking into it, we realized that it wasn't necessary. The user co-creation sessions were probably the biggest source of inspiration, but also the idea we were working with was a great idea, so that helped a lot. Yeah, just the team.
