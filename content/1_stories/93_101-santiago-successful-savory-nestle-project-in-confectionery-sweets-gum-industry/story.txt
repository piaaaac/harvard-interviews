Text: I get a brief, I read it, if I have questions I go to the account department or with the people in planning and we talk about it in detail. A lot of times I go with my partner or with the art director and copy in charge of the project. We talk about it and from there we go see if something inspiring arises from that moment so we can start working and then I let them work. I, on my own, deal with other things, look at it from different angles. If we don’t solve it at the moment, I go home thinking about it. When I get home I leave it outside my house. That’s how we work; that’s how I work, at least. A project where it all went well? It was with Sabori, ice cream. It was a very interesting project because we had never done it like that. It was a great experience. Our client told us that they had a problem. Each summer, in Chile at the beginning of the year, Sabori launches a product, which will be their great sale of the summer. They had normally had promotion or things of that sort and they asked us what we could think of. We thought about the Top Ice Cream from Sabori, which are the extreme ice cream cones. We came up with two different cones during the summer, and we came up with the idea of them being two cones, we came up with the flavors, their names and everything. We did all the communication; we really did it all. A project where it all went well? It was with Sabori, ice cream. It was a very interesting project because we had never done it like that. It was a great experience. The project was very interesting, it flowed well and the creativity was great. Plus, we were the best of the best in advertising efficiency in Chile that year. No other product sold so much as was as efficient as that one in every field. All other Sabori promotions were surpassed by 500 percent, all their previous sales for the last ten summers in this country. That was very pleasing, having that product and being involved in the client’s business, the way we did it was very gratifying. We worked really hard at it but in the end all of that was transformed in incredible acknowledgements. Very few times had I felt that happy, despite the fact that creatively we didn’t win anything, I thought that creatively it wasn’t a bad campaign but the commercial results were fantastic. I think that was impossible to beat. The project was very interesting, it flowed well and the creativity was great. Yes, absolutely. They were taking risks because on top of everything there was a worldwide concept for Extreme, which we were not respecting. It was a very tight concept and if we stuck to it, we were not going to make to where we wanted to go. So we went outside that box and we thought freely. Sabori took on a risk with that because they have to send this outside and report on what they are doing; but since it was so successful – like everything in life, it sold very well and was very successful so when they reported on it there wasn’t a problem. They didn’t reprimand them, on the contrary, they congratulated them. Had it not been that successful, they would’ve been sanctioned.  I think it said what it had to say. It was open, we had to come up with something because it wasn’t a specific product; something that was the big new thing this summer from Sabori, which sold as much as the previous summer. Those were the standards. It was very open. I think it said what it had to say. It was open, we had to come up with something because it wasn’t a specific product; something that was the big new thing this summer from Sabori, which sold as much as the previous summer. Those were the standards. It was very open. It was clear. I think it was clear. It was open but clear. Plus, we worked almost as a team, that was the best thing. I think that from that day on we achieved a relationship with Sabori that was great. One of the keys in our business is winning the client’s credibility. Once the client believes you can go and sell him anything. So nowadays that client believes us and that’s our ______. There isn’t any backstabbing or anything. We are friends. They were normal, yes. There’s an assigned budget and we didn’t go over it; and the time we took on it was the time we normally take on this type of campaigns. Yes, very good and from that moment on they were even better. After we had an evaluation – Sabori evaluates us and we evaluate them once a year. We have a system called Appraise and after having not-so-good evaluations, I think that was the beginning of amazing evaluations from then on.   In the agency? It was the best period. Very good relationships based on trust. We all respected each other opinions, so maybe the only conflict at the time was that I had a different creative director, who didn’t believe in this idea in the beginning. We presented this when we wasn’t with us, he was on vacation, and when he came and found out what we were doing and that it was already approved by the client and that it was already being produced, he didn’t agree. That was the only conflict but that wasn’t like a bad relationship either. “I don’t agree.” Now, had he been able to reject it before presenting it to the client, he would have done it. But since it had already been presented and approved by the client, he had to go with it. So we went outside that box and we thought freely. Sabori took on a risk with that because they have to send this outside and report on what they are doing; but since it was so successful – like everything in life, it sold very well and was very successful so when they reported on it there wasn’t a problem. They didn’t reprimand them, on the contrary, they congratulated them. Had it not been that successful, they would’ve been sanctioned. Once the client believes you can go and sell him anything. So nowadays that client believes us and that’s our ______. There isn’t any backstabbing or anything. We are friends.
