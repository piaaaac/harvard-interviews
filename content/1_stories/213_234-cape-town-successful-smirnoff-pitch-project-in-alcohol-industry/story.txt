Title: 234 CAPE TOWN Successful Smirnoff Pitch Project in Alcohol industry

Text: What happens off that, they presented and then the next day it was really, seldom happened. As a creative person you got like a little, you need to be nurtured, and looked after, so if you put in a lot of work, you know we work the whole weekend, it's great when somebody comes back to you immediately and says, you know, this is how it went. I mean, that's really important. And the next day we've called everybody in the whole agency and sat down in the board room, and they basically pitched to us what they had presented. So, that was really nice because for me, although you've got the creatives working on it, and the ideas, and we're making movies, and doing all the creative bits and pieces, you've also got the strategy guys working their asses off on case studies, strategy, that kind of thing. So, for me to see that portion of it was quite exciting, and beneficial, and appreciated, so yeah it was just, we all come out of the meeting, what they pitched, remembering case studies of things that we've done before, and just reassuring everybody here of what we are, and what we are trying to achieve, and I think unless you've been here a long time, you're gonna walk away from that going you know this is really dull. I think the majority of the people came away like, yeah, you know, excited about who we are as an agency and what we do. No I wasn't. But basically yeah, apparently very positive. They already good relationships with the brand managers at Smirnoff and JWT, cause we're doing both the [inaudible 00:04:30] at the moment as well. So, it's basically pitching for the below the line stuff. So, yeah ORD basically lost the below the line account, so we are at the moment, are doing a bit of the work as it stands, as we are the above the line agency. But then still have to pitch for the below one. I think we're one of five agencies that pitched. Hardy Boys been one of them. I think they were just so happy and impressed with what actually, with how it went down and the work that we put into it, that it was kind of like, we need to show everybody. I think that - I would say that they have, because we do above the line stuff, and have done a lot of work for them and have that relationship, they are pretty open minded and pretty secure in us as an agency and what we have to offer. Yeah, they kind of employee us to do our job, where, and times before in the past we've experienced, that we're employed to do what they want us to do. Why spend the money employing us when you're not going to use our ideas, you're going to still make us do your ideas, which is kinda of defeatus isn't it? It was interesting in the sense that kind of, because there was so much, so much stuff and so many ideas, it was a case of like constantly challenging it, going is this the right thing, is it the right, you know making sure it is on brief and on key. And I think because there were so many people involved and attacking it from different angles, that was key. Because sometimes you have a small bunch of people who have to do a lot of work, and then you just end of charging them in the one direction because no one's actually reigning you back to actually go have you look at it subjectively. So I think that was very key to the outcome, in the sense that the creative people would get cracking on it. And then you get, so then the strategy would come and check, we'd present to the strategy guys and then they would start asking us questions and make sure that we had thought of our. So yeah, and then from there as a strategy and creative team it was then presented to the MD. And then looked at it objectively again and then presented. You know what I'm saying, so it was constantly revealed and then challenged on a day to day basis, which was you know - Apparently it was good. Apparently because, all because we've done so much work with them in the past, that the relationship's already there and pretty cemented which is definitely beneficial. I think ... I think there's a competitive thing that also happens as you say, we've got the above the line guys, and the below the line guys, I think the competitive nature between the two of us, like that's almost you know, dissolves itself or it could be geared up or used to be benefit. Because we'll do something on our side, then they'll do the exact same thing, but their way. so yeah it was just, we all come out of the meeting, what they pitched, remembering case studies of things that we've done before, and just reassuring everybody here of what we are, and what we are trying to achieve,  where, and times before in the past we've experienced, that we're employed to do what they want us to do. Why spend the money employing us when you're not going to use our ideas, you're going to still make us do your ideas, which is kinda of defeatus isn't it? No one was impartial to it, and said `oh no we don't want that`. It was a case of we don't really know what it is, or no one has really given us a valid reason to drink it. So it was almost kind of based on validating it, you know, what is it and why you should drink it. And why. So basically, that's the brief was.   It was interesting in the sense that kind of, because there was so much, so much stuff and so many ideas, it was a case of like constantly challenging it, going is this the right thing, is it the right, you know making sure it is on brief and on key. And I think because there were so many people involved and attacking it from different angles, that was key.
