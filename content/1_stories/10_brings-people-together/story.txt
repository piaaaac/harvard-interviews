Title: Brings people together

----

Text: I coordinate the Intergenerational National Network. And one of the things that I feel very strongly about is that one of the most powerful ways of bringing people together across generations, is food. And so, I suppose in a sense, this is almost a bad story rather than a good one. Because obviously, that is one of the things we just have not been able to doâ€¦ I don't know if people are familiar with the work of the Citadel in Leith. But they do a load of really, really wonderful stuff. And one of the things they do, they do an intergenerational project called new spin, which brings people together on a Friday afternoon and people across generations, primarily young people and older people, but very much open to anybody. And what they do, they eat together, they eat and run tables. So there's no sort of sitting in your own little group. And then they do activities together. And it's been going for 10 years now. And it is just amazing. And they always make too many seedlings, they always make far too much too deliberately so that everybody takes food away from the weekend as well. You know, and it is about that, you know, everybody takes it away from the weekend, doesn't matter whether you're in need or not. And of course, that just hasn't been possible during Covid which is quite frustrating.
