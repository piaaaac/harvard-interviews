Text: I don't know if this is a good example, but once I walked so hard for, I don't know, one month or two months on the one brief, and we were all so tired and I did once for another client something three years ago and I thought `oh great. I could do exactly the same again because they didn't took the idea` and we presented it to the client and the client knew that from three years ago or something. He knew the idea that somebody has because they know each other; then we had a lot of problems because of that. And he told me- I was very young- `no. I know when I am finished` and he gone and that was advertising and I thought okay and then I called my Embassy and tell yeah the photographer is gone because he's the best, he know when [crosstalk 00:20:13].   And then my agency said it's okay. He's really so professional. If he say we have it, we have it. Six weeks after that, we had the presentation to Paesani. It was not enough. And then I spoke with my creative director and told him `look, the client is now really disappointed` and he told me then `yeah it's your fault`. Like why I told you. If you are our director, [inaudible 00:20:54]. It was fine And then my agency said it's okay. He's really so professional. If he say we have it, we have it.

It was a new client from Japan and, you know, I was too young to know more about the relationship between the client and the agency. And then I spoke with my creative director and told him `look, the client is now really disappointed` and he told me then `yeah it's your fault`. Like why I told you.
