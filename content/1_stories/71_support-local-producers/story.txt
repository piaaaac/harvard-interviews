Title: Support local producers

----

Text: We source our fruit, vegetables and eggs at Black Isle Berries at Tore. We have a garden full of apple and plum trees as well as berries. We tried growing vegetables this year and have winter veg growing. The only red meat we eat is local venison. We are trying really hard to not shop at supermarkets and support local producers. I also run a zero waste market which promotes local produce and plastic free shopping
