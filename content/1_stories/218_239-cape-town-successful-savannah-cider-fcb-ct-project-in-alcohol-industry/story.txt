Title: 239 CAPE TOWN Successful Savannah Cider [FCB CT] Project in Alcohol industry

Text: Yes. In Cape Town. They're also global. It wasn't one project. It was a long project but was a great piece of work to be involved in. It came from a really good strategic place. What they wanted to say was quite clear. All we had to do was think of interesting ways and different ways to just sort of actually ... the radio was probably the best part because there was a TV campaign which was [inaudible 00:08:04] was quite well established. But radio's always a tricky one for them to crack. They'd never done radio. The campaign worked well on TV but they couldn't translate like this was another agency before they came to us. They could never try to put that into radio. Just didn't know how to do it for radio. Some of the humor's funny to look at but to hear it's quite tricky as well. Jokes on radio sometimes aren't that funny. They think they're funny but they aren't. Well, the co director who was Francois and us two but we kind of ... the kind of people we understood quite well. We both had kind of quite dry humors. So we slotted in quite easily. So a lot of the stuff we'd do anyway because we knew they were funny and they were good and they were alright. But yeah it was just the two of us. I mean occasionally you'd get some help from Curtis would throw a line or two and you could make that into that. There was a little bit from the side but generally it was [inaudible 00:13:38]. I think the trick with that job was converting the humor from TV onto radio. That was the trickiest part. That was the part that had me [inaudible 00:17:04]. The other part was the best part. [inaudible 00:17:06]. On that one was very good, exceptional. They bought almost everything we did. There'd be occasional ones where they'd say that's too risky. We can fight it. Whatever. Whatever. We'll do once or twice for you guys but ... Well, just some of the humor was just a little too close to religious issues. We did a couple of those. So yeah, but they ... they were generally ... they were great. They really were great. They never ... they kind of let us do our own thing. I mean we knew obviously when you present which one's going to be a problem, if it's going to have religious or sexual issues or whatever you know or to upset. You know when you're passing the bar. But they were very amicable. They were very keen to work with us. They understood what we were doing as well. Obviously to make a joke, you have to piss somebody off. You can't be nice all the time. Some of them I don't think anybody, there probably were complaints on one or two but there was probably the risk the brand was willing to take because they were to be out there ... they had to be noticed. And you can't do anything with wallpaper. They were fine. We were fine. They were fine. I mean we had a better understanding of the brand than he did. His background, his cultural background was quite different to ours and his sense of humor was quite different to ours. We kind of left some to show where he didn't always get it. Well, I mean obviously there are when the spot is too risky and you can't do that. Try [inaudible 00:19:51] and we'll take that as a backer and that kind of a thing so, yeah. I think his background was very different to ours, even though he was a [inaudible 00:20:00] person, we came from different ... he was Afrikaans. And he was quite [inaudible 00:20:06] and young. So we kind of got it a little quicker than he did. I don't think they were [inaudible 00:20:30] but I don't remember any stumbling blocks in that brand, especially with client service. I think everybody ... oh yeah. I think it had to do with that it was such a fun bit of work to be on. Everybody kind of shared in it. You know? Just [inaudible 00:20:54]. Just didn't know how to do it for radio. Some of the humor's funny to look at but to hear it's quite tricky as well. Jokes on radio sometimes aren't that funny. They think they're funny but they aren't. But he'd get it wrong. It was quite funny. They were a little bit rude as well but [crosstalk 00:10:36] the rude ones. And they'd be sexual because they're quite funnier. People like that. Yeah, that was a huge campaign. I think they did 35 radio spots hat he used to ... a little [badge 00:10:46] front. A little bare jingle and it's, `Welcome to another session of [crosstalk 00:10:52] Barman Larry.` [inaudible 00:10:58] yeah that was great for us. It became huge for the brand. They still do them. And that was quite a coup for us because they were like doing ... conveying their humor from TV to radio was ... hadn't been cracked yet. Nobody had done it. Even when it was with Hunter Scott, they hadn't done [inaudible 00:11:33] a respected agency would manage to do that. So it was a really cool first. It never won any awards unfortunately which is always a bone of contention but it's still good for the brand. You know it's good for me. They still use it. Well, the co director who was Francois and us two but we kind of ... the kind of people we understood quite well. I suppose his superior who and it was one of those brands as well where there was a fair amount of success already. So if you tamper with something that was quite established would be very silly. So it just let itself go quite easily. We would ... I think we just bulldozed it a lot of the time because is was [inaudible 00:19:30]. Yeah I think and also it got to the point where kind of he trusted we knew what we were doing. I think his background was very different to ours, even though he was a [inaudible 00:20:00] person, we came from different ... he was Afrikaans. And he was quite [inaudible 00:20:06] and young.   I don't think they were [inaudible 00:20:30] but I don't remember any stumbling blocks in that brand, especially with client service. I think everybody ... oh yeah. I think it had to do with that it was such a fun bit of work to be on. Everybody kind of shared in it. You know?
