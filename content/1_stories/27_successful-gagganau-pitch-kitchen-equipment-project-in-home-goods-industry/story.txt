Title: Successful Gagganau pitch (kitchen equipment) Project in Home goods industry

----

Text: The brief came in. We had a lot of freedom in this brief because it was a pitch. We had to portray Gagganau as a premium brand, but at the same time they wanted to have a poetic and artistic touch to the ads. We had to do a set of print ads for mostly magazines, and we had to come up with ... It was like a trader's magazine that would go to retailers and stuff like that. For me, it was very [inaudible 00:07:28] because I had the freedom to actually write the poetry for this and to come up with visuals that would work together with the poetry, talk about the art of cooking and talk about, you know, yeah food and the goodness of food, but in a very professional way. It was pretty cool. It worked quite well. We got the pitch. Yeah. It was cool. I used this work to get accepted now in the young [inaudible 00:08:03] festival. I was very surprised, because it's a German company and it's a premium German company. We were expecting the brief to be very tight and to be very restrictive. But it actually once. It had actually been a pitch, and you usually have more freedom to do what you want. You still want to get the account. Yeah, it was quite a surprise. We had quite a lot of creative freedom, which was pretty good. More or less normal. Budget, for a pitch, it's usually low, but we had quite a lot of time to work on it, so it was fine. We didn't really see the client. I personally didn't meet with them. I think only the RECD met with the client. It was more the account servicing people meeting with them. We got feedback from them, but I didn't get to meet them. It was good. I was relatively new in the team. Yeah the relationship was good. They took in all of the ideas I had. I think I worked well with the ideas they had. I [inaudible 00:13:32] well. For me, it was very [inaudible 00:07:28] because I had the freedom to actually write the poetry for this and to come up with visuals that would work together with the poetry, talk about the art of cooking and talk about, you know, yeah food and the goodness of food, but in a very professional way. It was pretty cool It had actually been a pitch, and you usually have more freedom to do what you want. You still want to get the account. Yeah, it was quite a surprise. We had quite a lot of creative freedom, which was pretty good. I lived in Germany for a while, so I was kind of used to being around those kind of materials, those kind of utensils that they have there. I love cooking and I love wine and things like that. It helped me a lot. One of the ads we did was, I wrote a little something about Pinot Noir. It was very inspired.  Again, it was okay. I think everyone was well aligned in these projects. That's why it worked pretty well.
