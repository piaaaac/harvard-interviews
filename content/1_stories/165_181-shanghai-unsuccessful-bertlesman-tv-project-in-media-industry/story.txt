Title: 181 SHANGHAI Unsuccessful Bertlesman (TV) Project in Media industry

Text: Bertelsmann. B-E-R-T-L-E-M-A-N, sorry, S-M-A-N. And I was brought in, mainly to try and rescue because the team had kind of lost faith, it being one of these long nightmare projects, I can't even remember what the brief was, oh to come up with two forty-million-pound-generating TV concepts. We had a project manager we brought in from outside, and we had- No, it was mainly because we didn't have anyone internally that had any experience of generating TV concepts. A lot of the reasons were that, she as a Project Manager wasn't supported, in terms of knowing exactly how things work in terms of, resourcing how hard you have to put your foot down to get the team that you want and the resources that you need, and she was also very, she was struggling to learn the IDEO process and talk to the client in IDEO language, whilst also learning how to navigate IDEO as an organization, as well as navigating the client as an organization A lot of the reasons were that, she as a Project Manager wasn't supported, in terms of knowing exactly how things work in terms of, resourcing how hard you have to put your foot down to get the team that you want and the resources that you need, and she was also very, she was struggling to learn the IDEO process and talk to the client in IDEO language, whilst also learning how to navigate IDEO as an organization, as well as navigating the client as an organization. It didn't really come together, and I don't even know how we actually finished it, I think we shared them with the internal team, which in the end we didn't actually share them with the CEOs like we were supposed to.

It didn't really come together, and I don't even know how we actually finished it, I think we shared them with the internal team, which in the end we didn't actually share them with the CEOs like we were supposed to. The interesting thing there was someone internally had his own hidden agenda, that wasn't revealed until a lot later on. Client, yeah. So basically he patented some technology. The interesting thing was, we had another project for Bertelsmann running simultaneously looking at CRM systems, managing customer relationships, and that team had the stronger team ... the other team was slightly, I kept ended up coming to help, was slightly behind. The other team was almost setting the bar higher than the, for the client differently, and not all talking to the other team, so there were two, generally we had three teams, but we were very cautious, I think we learned from Bertelsmann that you've got to make sure you're delivering at the same level to the same client at the same time, because if one of you is delivering at this level and one of you is delivering at this level, it's really hard to justify that to the client, whereas if you just delivered the same kind of format, it makes a lot more sense. So I was brought in to help with the formative research, which, once we've got some ideas, taking them out and showing them to people, trying to get the teams to build the ideas, so to get consumers to help us build the ideas, refine them, and kind of try and make them as human [inaudible 00:05:00] desirable as possible. We had these concepts for something six propositions, so I kind of came in and was like, “Right guys, we've got to finish the prototyping,” and they were like, “The client doesn't like any of the ideas.” So there's kind of this whole tension where we needed to move forward, and the client, you know, “I don't like any of the ideas because I don't understand them, and I don't have the time to try and understand them.` But the interesting similarities with this project here is having that change of team internal, kind of IDEO team members in the middle, also a lot of information was lost, so that made it even harder to then try pull things together, because I came in and I was like, `What's this project about?` And they pulled the other person off, so that had kind of created really nasty friction ... I don't know what to say now. the client's hidden agenda  and also the lead client who was meant to be our point of contact wasn't particularly good at corralling the internal team or media creators, they all thought they were amazing, round to make one decision. I think it's a lot harder with newer clients, if we can get through that stage with clients than it tends to kind of develop into more efficient relationships, that's the one thing that can be a problem. A lot of it comes down to how the project is scoped. It's like we've been doing in London is almost having a team of people, that as you've got the team doing the project you have a second team of people making sense of what it means to the client, and helping facilitate the internal, having conversations, someone with IDEO having conversations with all the internal stakeholders about what they think is the answer, and then helping create almost a way in, making sure that when the ideas come up, we've almost got a process for crafting that feedback, and [inaudible 00:09:58] that feedback. It can, but it's a lot of resources. The interesting thing in China it seems, it's a lot harder to justify the size of the budgets for those kinds of projects, especially when you are working with what the flashlight was, a kind of local Chinese, more manufacturer, they're making flashlights, they're not a multi-million pound media company with money to invest. The projects where we've done that looking in, making sense, you can do that really easy with a big company, because you justify that they're really hard to understand. The interesting thing, when I was interviewing people and trying to work out what was the right curriculum for the project leadership program, virtually everyone that was Chinese that I spoke to all said the most important thing was knowing how to introduce yourself to people, and build rapport and build credibility with the client, so that they see you at the right level. That's one thing that we've got wrong on some of the projects we've done out here with Chinese clients is, certain team members were introduced, and they're not seen as [inaudible 00:14:19], they actually are, or their role is not as explained, and then they're perceived as less credibility than actually they deserve. And then it happens across offices, because our guys think in Chinese, when they're put onto an American, they do have English skills, but they're not able to articulate themselves quite so concisely, so people just assume that they're not as intelligent or not as capable of doing the job, which actually it's not the case. You put them in front of a Chinese client and they talk in Chinese, you know that they're talking a lot better than any of us could, even with an interpreter. It was awhile ago so I don't actually remember how much money it was, but it was a big hefty budget, I think they were like a million pound, million euro programs each. I think they were like 16 weeks, the kind of, from opportunity-area scoping and trying to find potential opportunity areas, through to actually prototyping some rough solutions. The interesting thing was, considering the scale, the client didn't react as badly as they could have done, but I think a lot of that was because they knew that they had thrown so many spanners in the works, and luckily the other project was hugely successful and they've decided to implement double, we offered I think two or three solutions, and they were going to choose one to take forward, and I think they're taking two forward. That kind of helped balance all the not-so-nice- stuff in the other project. The interesting thing, when I was interviewing people and trying to work out what was the right curriculum for the project leadership program, virtually everyone that was Chinese that I spoke to all said the most important thing was knowing how to introduce yourself to people, and build rapport and build credibility with the client, so that they see you at the right level.

It became really unhidden towards the end.

But the interesting similarities with this project here is having that change of team internal, kind of IDO team members in the middle, also a lot of information was lost, so that made it even harder to then try pull things together, because I came in and I was like, `What's this project about?` And they pulled the other person off, so that had kind of created really nasty friction ... I don't know what to say now. In other countries, just from what I've seen with the projects that have been going on here, in the UK it seems a lot easier for people regardless of actually who they are to actually get in to the people they need to speak to. Whereas in China it seems, you've got to really justify who this person is before they're allowed to speak to that person, not just being from IDO is enough, they've got to be the right person from within IDO. I think Shanghai is still trying to work out how that can happen, with the limited resources we have. It was an experiment that didn't work. A lot of the reasons were that, she as a Project Manager wasn't supported, in terms of knowing exactly how things work in terms of, resourcing how hard you have to put your foot down to get the team that you want and the resources that you need, and she was also very, she was struggling to learn the IDO process and talk to the client in IDO language, whilst also learning how to navigate IDO as an organization, as well as navigating the client as an organization.

The interesting thing there was someone internally had his own hidden agenda, that wasn't revealed until a lot later on. Also, anyone in a team can actually do it with the smaller projects, but unless someone kind of takes it as a role, “I am going to take responsibility for this,” I have seen it kind of get forgotten and then cause things to hiccup. It's not the only thing that cause [inaudible 00:11:28]. I think, for me it's made me realize that, that's one of the hardest things we often come up with is when the client comes to us with a problem, and a very specific design challenge, but actually the reason they've come to us is because they can't work out how to come up with the right answer themselves, because they don't know what they want. And when they've come with such an explicit design challenge, sometimes it can slip by that they don't know what they want, and they might have asked for something that actually isn't right for them, and isn't actually what they want.   We had these concepts for something six propositions, so I kind of came in and was like, “Right guys, we've got to finish the prototyping,” and they were like, “The client doesn't like any of the ideas.” So there's kind of this whole tension where we needed to move forward, and the client, you know, “I don't like any of the ideas because I don't understand them, and I don't have the time to try and understand them.` I think because of that, the change of team members, the fact that we did have this external contractor, and the client's hidden agenda, and also the lead client who was meant to be our point of contact wasn't particularly good at corralling the internal team I don't think we did the best to give him the tools to actually manage that, because I think he came across as very capable, so we just assumed that he could get the right kind of feedback from his guys. And I think with the flashlight it's the same, we didn't think about how showing them the ideas and getting them to grab some feedback, how difficult that could be, hadn't thought kind of far enough-
