Title: 144 SHANGHAI Unsuccessful Sumitomo [make wire harness for automobile] Project in Transportation industry

Text: Yeah, this is also this ... for my previous company. And also for the same story. So we want to develop some parts for Japanese customer, but is ... we have no Germany side involved, only Chinese team and the Japanese customer in Shanghai. The project is like this. It's a very simple project for cars. Our company is for car. So Japanese customer comes to our facility. And this guy, he worked for Honda, for Honda before, and he left Honda, joined tier one of Honda in Japan, and he comes China. He's very young, but in his team, he's the senior, the most senior people. He come to us, and he gave us the design he make. And the things is, he only do the design by his point of view. It's just for ... to have all of the requests from his side. But the things we ... I am the supplier, I have to make tooling to make this part. So the tooling actually have a lot of the issue. Sometimes, it's one structure. It's very easy to be finished in it's really [inaudible 00:43:41] remodeling but it's difficult to build. So for these other things, he ... how to say? A lot of the trouble in these kind of things, and we try to support him to keep his original thinking because this is very important for Asian people. So if you say that I want to, oh, you are my clients so I needed to keep your [inaudible 00:44:06] so if I say, `Oh, I don't agree with your design because it does not work.` I mean, a feasibility issue, and this not very good. You should express this in a very ... this way. Yeah. And we try first to keep his original design, and he very happy about this, but finally we think this is not good. We treat him in wrong way. We should have told him directly or told him much more stronger. So finally, his design is being modified a lot after tooling launched. So this cost us some extra money, make him not happy. So that's [inaudible 00:44:51] Yeah. This is interesting. Budget is always tight, but the schedule you can see is endless, can be extended. It means customer requested very strongly and strictly in the beginning. But anyway, there comes to some compromise so we modified the schedule again and again. So partly of the reason is from ... because these parts is finally to GM Shanghai. So GM Shanghai changes schedule, so we have [inaudible 00:50:24] this. And the other issues is from some our own sake only reason we have to adjust the schedule. So it seems very strictly and very tightly in the beginning. And actually, after we finish the project, we take a review. It's two times longer than planned, the plan. Yes, actually this is two things. One things that were ... the customer's engineer, they have their own experience and they saw a lot of the solution before. So we are a little bit specialist in just one narrow field. So from this [inaudible 00:51:21] our customer gave us some suggestion for design. This is one thing, and that thing is we get some good idea from our tooling supplier, because they make tooling and they finally is ... they fixed this real life. So they figure out some issues and they estimate some risk, in other words. So one side is from clients, also from our supplier we get the new idea or get the inspiration. Actually, it's quite well. It's quite pretty well in the beginning, and also after the project ends because he know we help him a lot. The things is ... the normal thing is that we treat him well as well, and the [inaudible 00:55:01] things is we try to save money for him and we make him know we make a lot of effort to do this, and make that very clear to him. So this is from two things. One thing is from the new design from our suggestion. We suggest it for you change a little bit in your design, this way it will save how much money. So this is one thing. Another things is the mistakes that already happened, tooling already make. We have to make it ... repair it. Or [inaudible 00:55:38] client. So we just send a description of this ... how this work cost, and we don't [inaudible 00:55:46] for long term relationship. So this make him very grateful for us, because actually, if his boss know this, will make him better performance something like this. So these things, these kind of efforts make the relationship very good. And finally, after one year when we pay our visits on their headquarter in Japan to do something and they call seminar. And this guy also take part in the seminar. And just after this meeting, he bring his section manager and his technical director to us. He said he want to involve us into some new project because of the excellent job we have done before with him to get. So you can see from if you try to keep a long term distance and you can use your company resource to save clients money and maybe sometimes to cover the mistake they made. This is very helpful, because they know they can trust you, they can depend on you. This is quite smooth because we are in the same culture. All the team is a local team in Shanghai, and team member is young so have no any family lot, so he can work overnight or even work on Sunday or Monday. What I can do for him is I keep him refuse the repeating work. I try to reduce the workload for him, and also try to create some chance for him to visit the supplier, to go into ... to go to take the technical training and maybe a business trip to Japan, these kind of things. Everything make him feel happy and feel ... be respected. Problem is like this. The main reason, I have to say, is the engineer from client's side is not so experienced. This is very normal in Japan, because Japan ... Japanese want to separate work in very detailed. Detailed [inaudible 00:42:31]. If you do this job, you just do this job in your whole life maybe. So they did not have chance to make ... to design a wider range of products, so their knowledge is very deep but very limited. So it is a problem. Actually, it's our client. So in this field, in the subcontract, or tier two, for automotive industry, not so much tolerance from client's side for innovation things. They also ask for safety. Make sure existing solution. Yeah. This is useful for two things. One thing is useful for quotation, and the second thing, is useful for us to prepare in advance. For example, we needed to buy the material they requested, and from their supplier. And also, we used this spreadsheet to figure out how much the workload will be, and we tried to keep the resource of [inaudible 00:53:30] for the design work. And also, we needed to negotiate with our tooling supplier in advance, because some schedule issue. Because our supplier is very busy, so we needed to talk with them. Oh, in the next two months we need to launch this tooling. Please keep [inaudible 00:53:48] for us. Something like this. He said he want to involve us into some new project because of the excellent job we have done before with him to get. So you can see from if you try to keep a long term distance and you can use your company resource to save clients money and maybe sometimes to cover the mistake they made. This is very helpful, because they know they can trust you, they can depend on you. if his boss know this, will make him better performance something like this. So these things, these kind of efforts make the relationship very good. PROJECT ID  you are my clients so I needed to keep your [inaudible 00:44:06] so if I say, `Oh, I don't agree with your design because it does not work.` I mean, a feasibility issue, and this not very good. You should express this in a very ... this way.   eah. And we try first to keep his original design, and he very happy about this, but finally we think this is not good. We treat him in wrong way. We should have told him directly or told him much more stronger. So finally, his design is being modified a lot after tooling launched. So this cost us some extra money, make him not happy. So that's [inaudible 00:44:51]
