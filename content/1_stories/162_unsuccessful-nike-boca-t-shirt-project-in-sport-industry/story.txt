Title: Unsuccessful Nike Boca T-shirt Project in Sport industry

----

Text: A project that didn’t go well? Projects don’t go well when you have a TV script and you don’t have the budget to do it as you would like, so you end up with a half produced idea. Yes, a thing about another project – it was also a project for Nike about the launch of the Boca t-shirt. So we came up with a digital experience, which was really good. It was a guy who was ____ the Boca t-shirt. It was to present the new shirt and we came up with a web where you could go in and you could see how everyday they would be signing the shirt until you finally saw the new Boca shirt. So it was approved by the local Nike client but it was never approved from the outside. So when it came out and people logged in from Spain and England and the person responsible for Nike in the U.S. learned about this and there was a problem because he hadn’t approved it and we had to take it down. We couldn’t send it to any festivals or anything. Yes, what happens is that it was very fast and there wasn’t any time to approve it because – I don’t know why but there was a deadline or the guy over here liked it and he was afraid they wouldn’t approve it. The website and everything went well, what happened is that we couldn’t benefit from it in festivals. We weren’t able to send it anywhere. Yes, it went public but what happens is that then they tell you not to send it anywhere because – No, we did it but you need to have their approval. In this case in particular, we then sent whatever we liked, but Nike didn’t let you send – No, we really didn’t have any problems. When they approved something and we started producing it, we didn’t have a lot of bumps in the road. Too small. The budget was for a graphic announcement and we did the web and that – He was very insecure and – In this second case they had a new French guy in Marketing and we didn’t get along very well. He was very insecure and – We didn’t get along because he was very insecure So we crashed a lot. For example, he didn’t know anything about soccer here and we did. So we crashed because he was very stubborn. He wouldn’t say, “Oh, you guys know.” He wanted to have the work done his way, not ours. So the relationship worsened. He wasn’t in this process; this is why it went so well. He was very much more like Nike was at the beginning. __________, he always leaned towards that. Very simple, not saying much more than, “Just do it.” He wanted to take everything to that side and we always wanted to do new things. So we crashed a lot. For example, he didn’t know anything about soccer here and we did. So we crashed because he was very stubborn. He wouldn’t say, “Oh, you guys know.” He wanted to have the work done his way, not ours. So the relationship worsened. He wasn’t in this process; this is why it went so well. Yes. Yes. If you have that guy who is the first approval filter, he can because you can’t go any higher. When you have someone that works with you, he will go higher and – It was also fine because it was working smoothly. They let us work so the processes were very well established. So it was approved by the local Nike client but it was never approved from the outside. So when it came out and people logged in from Spain and England and the person responsible for Nike in the U.S. learned about this and there was a problem because he hadn’t approved it and we had to take it down. We couldn’t send it to any festivals or anything. We didn’t get along because he was very insecure and saw advertising very differently than we did.  So we crashed because he was very stubborn. He wouldn’t say, “Oh, you guys know.” He wanted to have the work done his way, not ours. So the relationship worsened. He wasn’t in this process; this is why it went so well.
