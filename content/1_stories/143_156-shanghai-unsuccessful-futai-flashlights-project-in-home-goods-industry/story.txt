Title: 156 SHANGHAI Unsuccessful Futai flashlights Project in Home goods industry

----

Text: Basically, I have to say it's unfair, 'cause we lost money on this project. Partly, because of the way client works, and also because of the way our understanding of how client works. I mean, from IDEO's perspective, I would have said client didn't really take their responsibility as majority of the reasons why this project failed. You wanna listen to more details about this project, right? Quite simple. The the client makes a flashlight. They are like contract manufacturer, [inaudible 00:26:06] term. They make flashlights, and they show their design to buyers from the American supermarkets. Yeah, I definitely have my own perspective on that, why if you expand project on bad experience. Client came to us with a big investment for they want IDEO to do some magic design, which bring them more money. That's their ultimate goal of working with IDEO. They come to us, ask us to design two products, amounting to product categories ways to mass market product. That basically means older product, it can be appreciated by [inaudible 00:27:22] average consumers. The other one is unique category, which is the product needs to have some, either unique shape, or behavior, functionality, features, no matter how unique it is. What defines the unique? That's the probably, actually, for this project, because it's not defined clearly what's uniques, what makes unique. Starting from the first step we made a mistake. Understand a client's perception of a uniqueness, it's really important about, I don't think we did a good job on that. Mainly I think 'cause of their buyer turned down the concepts, that's the reason they're angry about us. They thought they spend this money with us and didn't give them the result which satisfies the buyer. That's the striking point to this relationship gone really bad. That's the story. Really low. We never do that. We can't guarantee, 'cause it's innovation process. No one can guarantee [inaudible 00:34:54] success. Yes, it's appropriate. Time, it's tight. I mean, at the end of the day it's just flashlight, right? It's just about illumination, easy to use, easy to store. I think their expectation was too high, maybe. That's the reason. We don't believe it's a completely failure, 'cause it's completely failure, 'cause it hasn't been done. It's just concepts. We haven't done any refinements yet. They didn't get it. That's the big argument [inaudible 00:39:39]. That's also why we were in such a bad relationship, 'cause we can convince each other. That's means, `Okay then, we don't give you design and we don't get money back.` Yeah, even it's frustrating. People, I mean trying to share the responsibility across the whole team, instead of blaming, `Okay, you a bad designer.` Review the bias of senior designers. We do believe their opinion comes a bit more than young designers. Then relationship became really bad, because they refuse to take the concept, I mean [inaudible 00:38:04] they take one concept from mass product, which they like, for the unique they don't like all of the, and they ask of you to redesign. We don't wanna redesign, 'cause we don't have results and we don't have budget. I fixed a faked project, we design, I mean we lost money on the project, so we don't wanna redesign. We were trying to trying to convince them, `Okay, can you give us some more specific feedback, which feature you like? Which you feature you thin is bad? That we can refine those features and make that better design.` That's their argument. Our designer team is actually quite international. There's German designer, American designer and Chinese designer. We don't think it's a big deal. That's their talking point. Mainly I think 'cause of their buyer turned down the concepts, that's the reason they're angry about us. They thought they spend this money with us and didn't give them the result which satisfies the buyer. That's the striking point to this relationship gone really bad. That's the story. Definitely the stories of how American consumers use flashlights, and also a bigger box of samples, which Christine bought from the American. All kinds of flashlight designs. I mean, it's true, it's true, sometimes people don't really use flashlights. Some people use a certain [inaudible 00:36:02]. The design's kind of boring. Not too big variety. Last week, I just sent out a final, 'cause we finished our design, the mass product, we finished the design refinement. Right now it's just them. We're hoping they can give us outstanding, and [inaudible 00:40:13] that we can hand over the deliverables to them. If they don't give us to us any fee, we wouldn't give them the design. That's the end of the story. We send out notification of this statement, but make statement clear statement. `Okay, you pay amount, then I give you what we done. You don't pay, we don't give.` Usually was good, 'cause the client took IDEO as a shining star that they showed off respect, I guess, 'cause I wasn't involved in [inaudible 00:36:49]. That's my guess. Initial respect IDEO, they rely on IDEO, totally. I guess they were hoping IDEO can deliver something magic. We cut of a unique concept, therefore we actually revised our design fee for the design concept regeneration, that also design refinement, but for research, we didn't want to reduce the design fee, because we think the research is about finding out user behavior, and user needs. We didn't intend to divide the research result into two categories. That's the reason we wanna charge full price for the research fees. Our client, they have different understand of that. They said, `Okay, we cut off one category. We just shouldn't compress into half. Half for all the phases.` Really low. I mean, they actually wanna, once I do to current team, that sells performance, they wanna sign an extra contract with IDEO, like a loyalty contract, `If the product sells well, okay, you get benefit. If it doesn't sell well, okay, I only pay maybe half of the design fee to you.` Christine finished the research on then brought back a bunch of opportunity areas, the design principles for the designers to follow. The designers just generate some ideas based on what they learn from Christine's stories. We were hope to look at the concepts and pick one concept from each category and based on which we can find a design the make that final product design. That's basically how the process went. [inaudible 00:29:23] design, it didn't make any comments that it brought a design to their buyer. They showed the concepts to the buyers. Buyers, they [inaudible 00:29:35]. They need to convince buyers this designs are good, then buy the product from them. That's the way they make money. I think they got some bad comments from clients, and they just came back to us and say, `Okay, those designs bad. I want a design for the American market. This products must be designed the American designers, 'cause they can roll out with flashlights. You Chinese designers, you rarely use flashlights. How do you know how to design a nice flashlight?` After the turning point of the whole project, the relationship pretty comes pretty bad. We were trying hard to convince them those concepts are good concepts, they are promising, and that they are showing something new, and some unique feature. It doesn't have completely new, quite interesting if you're compared to some existing products, but clients he didn't get it. They come back to ideas saying, `Okay, you guys just copy some existing products, but we didn't.` Not yet. Actually, before this final official notification, I've sent out many emails. They never got back to us. Then, we send Christine. She was in charge of user research, consumer research in the America, talking to a bunch of American people. The market of our client is in the America, the one that's designed products for the American market. That's the reason we send Christine to it. They have an American talking to some American consumerist, try to understand their needs for the flashlight. They got to find a new opportunity areas. Also, send out a notification of project termination, `Okay, if I don't receive any feedback from you, response from you within 30 days, written document, stated in a legal document, if I don't receive any feedback within 30 days, we consider this project terminated.` Did do a good job of communication. We did a project debrief, basically laying out all the feelings we think finally land a project into a big failure. It's just about a lesson learned. Nobody really sulking, usually take responsibility of this. Personal relationship, it's definitely still good. We're still team. That's what I like about IDEO.   Yeah, we didn't have one dictator making one dictator making all the decisions.
