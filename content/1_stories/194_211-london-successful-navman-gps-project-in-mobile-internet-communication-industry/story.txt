Text: It's just a very good, big, big project to get your teeth into. And I learned a lot as well, so learned good. But not too much learning, cause that's not smart. On the client's side, it's usually someone who's my mirror in a way, like their project manager. And then, I don't know, it depends on the organization. These plans look like it's just a mess, and the latest client, the current client, is just a mess. We've got about twenty CEOs and CTOs that all have something to say and all have some decision to make. It's just a fuckin' nightmare. It makes the project a nightmare because everything takes five times as long. So, I don't know, there's about ten people who have a say in what happens, which is a pain. But listen, there, I know there's like, nobody will like decision-maker [inaudible 00:03:46], so some guy at the top will say something all filled with rude, so like, someone who's a spokesperson to communicate that decision. It's rare that I'll be making some sort of communication with the main guy at my tack. It wouldn't happen. But his decisions come through the team. Yeah. We're usually dealing with... it depends on the company. I mean, Navman and SKT, well Navman's a good example because Navman only do... the only people we were working with was the in-car device department, if you want to call it `department`. But, so they're the only people we're dealing with. We're not talking to the CEO of Navman, the actual whole company, because they're dealing with [inaudible 00:04:51] to do all sorts of different types of nav-piece devices. No, they're just sort of risk-averse. And it pisses me off, cause they're [inaudible 00:05:53] right? They gave us half a million pounds, right? And they go, right, we want the best this, the most innovative this, and no, we want... And they've obviously got massive aspirations, but then [inaudible 00:06:06] showing something, right. The feasibility of films come on, and they're just like, bang all the ideas. [inaudible 00:06:10]. And they go oh, we can't do that. So, it's well, don't do that, no, it doesn't make any money. Oh, can't do that, people won't like it. This is like project-miser, this is what the project's like. Yeah, they always do. It always changes. I don't even know how to answer. The brief changes so many times, it's kind of unbelievable. Especially with Asian clients, they're just, you show them something, and dunno, it changes. You're always having this argument, saying look, this high that I'm dealing with now, the miracle [crosstalk 00:08:19] is like, this isn't part of the statement of work, it's old-school, we're not doing it. Time's never the problem, but yeah, I guess so. I mean, you do what you can with the time at the end of the day. It's always tight, it's always very tight, yeah, it's all very tight. Some of these old designers, right, is that they're never satisfied. So we're all completely anal, and you polish diamonds forever, and it's never shiny enough. Do you know what I mean? And you're always unsatisfied with it. So, we're in this constant state of fuckin' miserableness because nothing's ever good enough for us, and you always wanna do better, and you always try to do it better, so you always feel like you don't have enough time and enough money to do the job. So, but I think that's one of my roles, I think, as the project manager, to just go look guys, you've fuckin' done enough. Send it, cause it's down in the little things, there's nothing left. Clearly, there's people that you can't get on with sometimes, but there's a professional air about. It all has to be professional. But there's plenty of times when we've done lots of things together in Taiwan in the middle of the night, getting cobbling drunk together. So yeah, good. Why don't we connect? Just cultural, I mean. It's just very difficult [crosstalk 00:12:29], especially in Korea, where it's very hierarchical, and everybody looks the same. You go over there and like you design everyone. Nobody has an opinion in Korea, you have to be very senior before you have an opinion. Otherwise, people are very scared of being criticized for their opinion, so they don't say anything. You don't have an opinion, cause you might get criticized. And they don't wear anything different, or they don't look different. So that's quite hard. It's a massive conflict with us. If you pack your bag now and go an live in Korea, you can imagine what it's like. And this isn't when you work with clients, this is big cultural differences, one of which is obviously that they [inaudible 00:13:16]. But it's a very different approach On this one? It was cool, it was really good. I mean, it depends on what role you take as a project manager, really, because clearly you have some people on the team that are very experienced, and then you have other people who are less experienced, maybe there's even juniors, straight out of university and stuff, so you have to put on a few different hats. You just project manage, but to the really inexperienced people, you're a kind of mentor, so there's a bit of teaching as you take them through this new thing that they're doing. And you have to support them, but I think you have to be firm as well if they do things wrong, or if they're not doing exactly what's expected of them, then you have to be a bit school teacher-ish. But then there's the other extreme for that is the really experienced people who are possibly even intimidating because they might be more experienced than you are. And they have a very specific way of doing things, and you have to debate whether that is the right process with them. The best way to get around all this obstacle course is to have a very open conversation right at the beginning with the whole team and just ask every team member, get them all to go, what's your goals? What do you want to do in this project? How do you want to approach it? What are you insecure about? What do you think you might need help with? All this kind of stuff. Just have a big conversation, right at the beginning, because that lets everyone understand that if you get into trouble halfway through the project and somebody's underperforming or it's not going well, you don't get on with someone, the least they feel they've got someone they can come and talk to, like the project manager. Or these are the systems here that we've got if things start going wrong. I dunno, I mean you hear about it all the time, there's people that don't get on, clearly. We don't all get on with each other. And there's times when people bitch and complain. But I've seen worse in other companies. For some reason, our deal employs the sort of people that can be adult about it and professional about it. We have had people here before who've been sacked quite quickly who can't deal in a professional ideal type work, stuff. And they haven't lasted very long. It's just an attitude thing, you have to try very hard when you employ people to understand that they're the right type of people. It was fine. I know we had one guy who had just joined. He'd had a long job before that, it wasn't a job, he was kind of self-employed before that. And he was just like working on his own for five, six years before he joined Ideal, and he was very difficult to bring into the team because he was very into it, he worked in [inaudible 00:17:27]. And that was tricky. It was very hard for the rest of the team to connect with him because he just wasn't around. He'd just go off somewhere and nobody knew what he was doing. I made quite a big point of sitting together, everyone sits together in the project space and you have to get on with them, so everyone does get on. You can't have people that... you just can't allow it. We've got about twenty CEOs and CTOs that all have something to say and all have some decision to make. It's just a fuckin' nightmare. It makes the project a nightmare because everything takes five times as long. And they go, right, we want the best this, the most innovative this, and no, we want... The feasibility of films come on, and they're just like, bang all the ideas. [inaudible 00:06:10]. And they go oh, we can't do that. So, it's well, don't do that, no, it doesn't make any money. Oh, can't do that, people won't like it. selling these things to women, make it more unisex, and how we can take the device out - what happens when you take the device out of the car and into your lives? So that, you know, that's nice. So they're asking for all this stuff, and I'm the one that's changed the brief, because it is, they're asking for stuff. They go, oh, are you doing this for us? We were expecting to see this, and yeah, you have to just say, oh, man, look at this statement of work, that's why it's here, there's the work [inaudible 00:08:40]. They still are going to write that at the beginning, with people that don't know what they're fuckin' doing, because you're just getting completely screwed by the client if you don't have a very concrete, very well-communicated statement of work at the beginning of the project. It's always tight, it's always very tight, yeah, it's all very tight. Some of these old designers, right, is that they're never satisfied. So we're all completely anal, and you polish diamonds forever, and it's never shiny enough. Most people are quite unhappy with the shit that they buy. you shouldn't be doing it, because the world's full of shit already, and you don't need to put any more shit into it. But it's more difficult with the Asian clients culturally, cause it's just difficult to connect with them. You just don't connect as well. Why don't we connect? Just cultural, I mean. It's just very difficult [crosstalk 00:12:29], especially in Korea, where it's very hierarchical, and everybody looks the same. You go over there and like you design everyone. So that's quite hard. It's a massive conflict with us. If you pack your bag now and go an live in Korea, you can imagine what it's like.   And that was tricky. It was very hard for the rest of the team to connect with him because he just wasn't around. He'd just go off somewhere and nobody knew what he was doing.
