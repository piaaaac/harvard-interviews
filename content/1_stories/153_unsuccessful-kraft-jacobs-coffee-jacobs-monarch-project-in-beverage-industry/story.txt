Text: With me, personally, I have to run from a client and I mean I really have to run off the account because ... and now, we've got a group doing this stuff because somehow I got really ... I really got into getting crazy because it was so strangely organized on the client side. It's not the client service side but it's their own thing. They never know what they want. They have a lot of disrespect to the agency. They're trying to compete their agency. There's a very good book that was written by a guy. His name is Johnny Gatardo and the book is called Advertisement Beats Working for a Living. It's a very small book but on the other side, there's a lot of very nice stuff there and these are like ... They have seven deadly sins of the client and seven deadly sins of the agency. These seven deadly sins were committed ... All of them were committed by the client. They had a very tedious general marketing director. She's a very strange lady. Estranged I'd say. These guys were competing with us. They were giving us a brief and at the same time, they were trying to think of something on their own every time and all the other stuff that they were doing. I had to run from it because somehow I really started falling ill with them because when ... We are soldiers sort of. We cannot get ourselves in the situation wherein we're not performing. We're trying to perform all the times and if it never gets any life, it's like you are losing your function. This is something which puts me in an asylum, you know. This is the moment I just threw the towel, and maybe that was childish but I said, "Well, you know, it seems like I can't work on this exact account because it beats me. It defies my ..." Yes, yes. When came to the agency and I found out that this account, this client ... I mean this product has such a badly built base and they still have so little visual material that we can show and all sorts of things. I was beating the whole thing. I said, "Well, I've got a lot of ideas how we can improve, and I have them." By the end of the day, I said, "Well, you know, you've killed me, guys." Which was not professional and it's still a big fault of mine I think. I don't like myself for nothing for this exact story. Zillions. I mean from our side, we have a dead team because they couldn't work anymore and when I came, they were still on the project but they were like dead so I picked it up myself which I shouldn't have done. It was me and the strategics and their client service and somehow ... No. We ended up three people doing this project now. At first, I just couldn't put anybody there, and I had to do it myself and this is where I maybe I burnt my fingers. Well, basically, it's funny because there are four or five minion ladies and there was this main lady. Also, we had the network. It was doing strange things to us because we couldn't show anything to the local client before the networks use it. The network is not very cooperative on this thing. It wasn't. It wasn't. Somehow that was maybe something else or some sort of personal thing there. So, basically four I think. There was one main lady that didn't take credits of the fact that she is ruling the main market for this product except for Germany and she didn't take the responsibility. I mean she could have used it to be more decisive and she didn't, and this is a pity. Yeah. It was funny. At some moment, I was so negative. I said, "Look, guys. You are actually biting all our fresh leaves off." I said, "Why, why?" I just feel we can do it this way." All of a sudden, the client said, "Okay. Let's go into research." This is where we should have stopped ourselves and said, "No, no, no, no, no. Let us decide here exactly what we researched because if you're going to interfere on the preparation stage, we're not getting a right answer and it means like you're mostly framing us this way." But still they did research and the research went out. It has come out as all the research is happening with this client because they are advertising one thing and they are trying to research another because they have male-looking product and they are trying to get out warmth but they never put into the ads. So, it's funny. They're trying to collect something that they don't ... It's like when you plant, I don't know, peaches and try to collect oranges, expect to collect oranges. "Wow, we're getting peaches. We're getting a lot of peaches here. Why?" Because we have a peach tree for God's sake. It's funny. Well, exactly how I described it previously. Trying to get warmth into a very cold and otherwise unfriendly brand, which is the market leader to some extent but we never know. Maybe we should get more warmth into it but then we'll ... Because we are not getting warmth as a ... It should be friendly and sort of amicable, and all of a sudden, this thing is not friendly and amicable. Who in hell decided that if a brand called Monarch could be friendly and amicable? But we ended up trying to do it. Well, I think if not to take the technical issues, they never pay. Well, they do of course but they're not paying time. But that's some sort of their own thing. Yes, I think it was adequate. I haven't done anything. I just run away. But we've done something now and well, I don't know. You should ask [Jima 01:01:36]. He's okay with it. The other- When you get together with the smaller ladies, they were all very nice but all of a sudden, when she entered the room, everybody started being very mean to us. I would say they're mean. Now, it's much, much better because they never ... They never renewed the contract with the old lady so she had to leave to another company. Now, I think everything is better but still they're trying to compete with ... Also, the network is trying to compete with us. They didn't like us doing original work somehow, which I find a little bit of ... Not a law, of course, but I find that in other networks. I didn't see a lot of very generous networks. I mean they all want results and money, and of course, they don't want to take risks or they usually say, "Why don't you take our work?" They were okay but of course they got pissed off when I left. That's all. Of course, since the client wasn't very clear, they sometimes also broke your mind because, of course, they convey a lot of things that the clients sort of invents. Usually, it ends up with everybody's brain damaged. This is the moment I just threw the towel, and maybe that was childish but I said, "Well, you know, it seems like I can't work on this exact account because it beats me. It defies my . I mean this product has such a badly built base and they still have so little visual material that we can show and all sorts of things. I was beating the whole thing. I said, "Well, I've got a lot of ideas how we can improve, and I have them." By the end of the day, I said, "Well, you know, you've killed me, guys." Which was not professional and it's still a big fault of mine I think. I don't like myself for nothing for this exact story. At first, I just couldn't put anybody there, and I had to do it myself and this is where I maybe I burnt my fingers. eah. It was funny. At some moment, I was so negative. I said, "Look, guys. You are actually biting all our fresh leaves off." I said, "Why, why?" I just feel we can do it this way." All of a sudden, the client said, "Okay. Let's go into research." This is where we should have stopped ourselves and said, "No, no, no, no, no. Let us decide here exactly what we researched because if you're going to interfere on the preparation stage, we're not getting a right answer and it means like you're mostly framing us this way." Actually, this is what happened because she said, "Let's go into research" but they tweaked not because they wanted us to fail. They just tweaked it because they felt like it should look like this. We should have researched what we want and it tweaked. That tweaking, I think, to my feeling, tweaking has also obscured the results somehow.  I think, in Russian at all." It just doesn't. Then in a year or two or three, once you were doing good work, they start listening to you and that's nice. But usually, it comes through a lot of tedious explanations.
