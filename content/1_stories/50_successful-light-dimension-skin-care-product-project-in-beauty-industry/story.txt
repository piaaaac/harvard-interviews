Text: And after that I need to have client to get the design into production. To make sure my design is realized as the way it was designed before. To make sure the quality and delivery, and logistic, whatever, to be perfect fit to the client's requirements. That's what I'm doing here. Yeah, so this project the client is a startup company in Palo Alto. So we help them from the design, from the user research into the mass production. So it's a company built project. So I think we did pretty well. I mean from the design to production. We help the client to efficiently design, understand the user, and find very good supplier, which is including Pudong in Shanghai. Help them set up the manufacturing process and assembly line. Finally, we got the product shipped to the market. So I think we finished the project under budget and with very good quality. So I think it's very successful, yeah. Not very willing, yeah. [crosstalk 00:13:41]. We were satisfied with what we did, and how much we charged them. We help them to keep very good relationship with the supplier, because they're a very small company and IDEO is a company with very good reputation. We help them to build a relationship with the supplier. Without IDEO I don't think the supplier will work with this company. Every time we had some request we just responded to the client very quickly. Because the client don't have an engineering team, so IDEO always have some engineers available for their quick, how to say, short time notice. Kind of yeah. I mean in Shanghai, we're just a small team here, we can get on with each other very well. And in Palo Alto we have another team, they are... in IDEO maybe you don't know, manufacturing team, most of them are very experienced and they're very respectable and high tiered in IDEO. On this project, the team in Palo alto is very strong, and they are very old. Like 50 or 60 years old. They can get along very well, and they respect each other very well. Every time we have some disagreements, just sit down with each other and get it fixed. On this project, the team in Palo alto is very strong, and they are very old. Like 50 or 60 years old. They can get along very well, and they respect each other very well. Every time we have some disagreements, just sit down with each other and get it fixed.  So my responsibility here is first to help the designers, the ID or mechanical designers, to make their design more manufacture-able. Sometimes when they design products, they just randomly design and get some ideas. But it's very possible when they finish their design or when we review their designs, we find oh it's not going to work. We cannot make it. So I need to help them to make sure the design is feasible, it's make-able. And secondly, I will have the project clients who look for and locate confine suppliers in Asia area.
