Text: But yeah it kind of went really smooth, I think it went so smooth because we ignored the brief, we went back to the client which is usually the wrong thing to do, you need to answer the brief but we didn't because we couldn't find anywhere to go with it that was interesting, and they bought off on the idea that yeah these are people who weren't generally confident, it gives them confidence, they could make sense to their brand. And it all went through pretty well.

And it all went through pretty well. We got a great photographer on board, probably Australia's best portrait guy, so that helped, the fact that he was really confident and could deliver. That really helped in the client meetings, and the fact that we were really excited about the idea. I think the general excitement from the team made a big difference in selling it to the client, but I think the key thing for it was the client wasn't too attached. Because I think the product was on it's way out anyway, ad they cold afford to take a chance on it.

Because I think the product was on it's way out anyway, ad they cold afford to take a chance on i It wasn't like their leading product and if it went wrong they could lose millions of dollars but really they had nothing to lose so they kind of let us have our head and the ads came out and a lot of people commented on them, actually don't really know if it turned the product around, but probably didn't actually, because a couple of years later we didn't see any of them around anymore. But yeah, from a creative point of view it was lots of fun and we thought it was successful, the creative heads around the world in the JWT network agreed that it was good work, they rated it on our creative rating system quite highly, and yeah so for me that was one that was quite successful. I supposed you hear a lot of comments that too many cooks are spoiling the broth in the advertising industry and stuff, and the fact there's a lot of overthinking of stuff before it even gets on the table. It's kind of we want you to think in this direction and don't really stray from there. I don't know, maybe I'm just jaded about being in this industry about 10 years and I feel quite constricted about what I can do and then when you do come up with something that gets you excited, it gets over analyzed and internalized and the thing that keeps the screen that people see is generally something that's been waves and doesn't really make a lot of sense anymore. The relationship's were really good, they enjoyed the process and I think they were actually quite excited about doing something a bit out of the box as well. There was a mixture of excitement and nervousness I think. I think they were kind of... it sort of felt like they were in unchartered territory for a while there, and not really... because there wasn't a process anymore, it had become a creative thing that we were just sort of winging a little bit towards the end, trying to get the right people. There was a lot of discussion and angst about were they too out there, do they look too weird, just generally trying to manage something that was becoming more unmanageable by the day. It's a little bit of nervousness I think. Planning was interesting. They were excited to be part of the project, and I felt like they were playing both sides of the fence really, really gunning for it to be really different but then trying to placate people who were a bit nervous about it. I think they were kind of caught in the middle, to be honest. They're probably quite ballistic thinkers and that's how it felt, they were just trying to appease everybody and still get the best result, really.
