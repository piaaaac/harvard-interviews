Title: 182 SHANGHAI Unsuccessful Bertlesman (TV) Project in Media industry

Text: There was a client team of six or seven. And so it was ... they tried to get questions slightly by consensus. So it was ... [inaudible 00:00:33] was meant to be one [inaudible 00:00:35]. It was kind of again a very tiered organization so we had to get the buy-in from the core team of seven people what ideas we would take forward to show to the CEOs. And so we were showing things to two CEOs, two different divisions, and then that ... and let the executive board and that executive board was going to decide which one they took forward. And so because of that it was ... we weren't allowed to show anything to the board. Some of the people that knew were close to the board. So we weren't allowed to talk to the board but our core team, once we got them to agree, then had to ... they had people they wanted to convince things to and then they passed those messages on to the people around the board. And the board only ever saw the final [inaudible 00:01:49]. So even though we were trying to design for these kind of ... to get the buy-in, we had to get the people around these people that almost protected to try and make the decision, which was slightly strong. So once these guys were getting to know the board where the final ideals were going to, their ideas, and they were helping bridge that link between our core team we were working with and the core with an extra pair of eyes into this pen of executive board and CEOs that were actually going to make the final decisions. So there were, on the IDEO side there was, I think, two people, three people that were having regular reviews, critiquing what the project team was doing. There was also a business factors person who was very much had a strong opinion of what was right. So I suppose you could almost call him a decision maker. And he was really flying the 'look we can't suggest that to them because it's never going to make them any money.' He was slightly closed to coming up with creative new ways of making money but it was more of a 'that's not going to make money.' And then we also brought in a third decision maker towards the end to help push it forward. So one, two ... four, five key decisions makers in a team of eight. Well there was the project manager. Well it kind of changed. There was the project manager, and there was a team of one or two ... in the project team there was the project manager and a business factors person. And then outside the ... there was people meant to be doing the sense making but that wasn't to feed into the actual project being delivered. It was always like a third piece of work that was actually completely separate. So once they were learning things, none of the learnings were really being considered what was the right way it was more of us helping them write a pipeline of innovation and then set up for the global company rather than the two separate companies that we were working with.   So I suppose you could almost call him a decision maker. And he was really flying the 'look we can't suggest that to them because it's never going to make them any money.' He was slightly closed to coming up with creative new ways of making money but it was more of a 'that's not going to make money.'
