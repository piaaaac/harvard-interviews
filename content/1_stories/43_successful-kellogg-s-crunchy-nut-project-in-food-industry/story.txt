Title: Successful Kellogg's Crunchy Nut Project in Food industry

Text: Yeah, I think, because they probably give that a bit more leeway, the way that it's meant to be ludicrously tasty, so it's meant to be ludicrous fun. But it's still quite controlling on that, they're still quite afraid to do anything too mad. There's no risk takers, really, in this. Yeah there is, but you always finish...there is, because the whole idea is like one taste is meant to be ludicrous, he tastes, it's meant to be a ludicrous idea. So in the end it's got to be ludicrous. But then they're always...put a massive restraint on that. Not too ludicrous, not too ludicrous, it seems. Yeah, we wanted to shoot three, actually, so we wanted a bit more money and they wouldn't give it to us, so we had to shoot the third one for like next to nothing, so, the budget was... No, we shot that one when we got home, we shot it with a different director. It was supposed to....it's a bit of a long story actually. We thought the director that we got to shoot the two of them were gonna shoot the third one for next to nothing. When we got out there, we realized they weren't actually up for doing that, and we...I was quite upset by that actually. Got into a bit of an argument over it. I feel that was our producer's fault. It's a bit of a long story, really. I think our producer panicked, because they thought...all their job was to do was to get this thing signed off. But the way it was is that our favorite ad was the third one which the client -- was kind of the riskier one, which the client didn't want to shoot. They said do you think you can get that shot with the others, that's fine, but get the two shot that we've researched and that we like. If you get the third one shot with them that's fine. ...yeah, we're already out there and the first time we met, we'd never met him before. Spoke to him on the phone, and we got there, he's like, well...Craig said, actually, he's like well, you'd just said that, then we might not have gone with you, and we might have chose someone else. And that was the first time we'd met him, and he's shooting the next day and he's like, ahhh...But we were so upset by it [inaudible 00:37:59] Yeah, but I don't think it was their fault. I think it was the kind of thing that happened, I think our producers sort of misled it into thinking they were going to shoot it. Our producer here. Because I think she just wanted the job signed off. Because the client didn't' care about shooting the third one, the third one was more for me and Craig. Yeah. So the one that we really liked is the one that didn't get -- but then when we got back, we got someone else to shoot it. Yeah, seemed okay. Again, Kellogg's, they're quite conservative really, so, you don't really agree totally with what they're saying. But I think a lot of that probably could be sorted out if you had more contact with them. And that just doesn't seem to happen Yeah, always good, yeah. We always stick together on teams, so... So we never picked anyone, even the same in the case of the Crunchy Nut ads. And actually we start messing with them. One of them will come back over from Canada to do the grading and stuff in Soho. In the end we took it, we started changing so much, he said I just want my cut and I want to go back home. He sort of left it with us. That's happened quite a few times, but that's the way it goes. Yeah, [inaudible 00:42:26] the producer that was responsible, she organized the third one, so it got shot in the end, so it wasn't the end of the world and it turned out okay. I'll get them for you, you can look at them. It was kind of an obvious thing, it was kind of blatant really, what they were doing, but it was [inaudible 00:33:45] because it was so blatant, because they're obviously saying eat more, so, spend more money. So we just caught the line, it's like, get home and have some. It's just about people getting home as quick as possible so they can have their Crunchy Nut Cornflakes. To get home in sort of ridiculous, ludicrous ways. And that was quite enjoyable and that got bought pretty easily. But it's still quite controlling on that, they're still quite afraid to do anything too mad. And our producers gave us the impression that our directors were up for doing that. Then we got out there, they said no, there's not enough time. And then we got into a bit of an argument about, oh, if you had told us that... Craig said, actually, he's like well, you'd just said that, then we might not have gone with you, and we might have chose someone else. And that was the first time we'd met him, and he's shooting the next day and he's like, ahhh...But we were so upset by it Again, Kellogg's, they're quite conservative really, so, you don't really agree totally with what they're saying. But I think a lot of that probably could be sorted out if you had more contact with them. And that just doesn't seem to happen No, it never seems to happen. You don't get enough contact. I don't blame the clients for being sort of suspicious of us, because if you've never met someone, then why would you trust them? Yeah, that was kind of weird. I think it got there in such a panic situation with the producer, and I don't think she realized how much we wanted it. It was just a funny, well it wasn't funny, it was really annoying at the time, but that's the way it goes. Because you're always under pressure aren't you?  We still had those, two other ads to shoot, so, the next day we were shooting the two other ads, so it was kind of just a bad way to start the shoot, really, because it was like hold on...I don't really know, I don't know to this day how it happened. We were totally under the impression, Craig and I were under the impression that this other ad was gonna get shot. So it was a bit of a shock. No, I think that they turned out quite well, the ads. I don't think the directors knew, we haven't really shot with anyone which we thought, that's brilliant, we'll use them again. We've always been quite critical of...whenever we shoot and ad, it's often like, when you see the first cut, we're never happy with it, and that's always like...you turn on, you see, that's really disappointing. And we saw a mess of it a lot. Yeah, and if you put them in a room with strangers and they think, well what should I be saying? [crosstalk 00:43:55] put mums together and they all think...
