Title: 119 SYDNEY Successful Kleenex TV spot Project in Home goods industry

Text: On the other hand, which was exciting because Kleenex, we've changed the brand. We changed a 15 year brand for one T.V. spot, which was interesting. Normally it's all about fluffy ducks and being happy and cutesy-wootsey you'll see in wallpaper advertising? But with this one we decided with people, it's all about facial tissues and people crying, and I don't see how fluffy ducks is going to help with this, so we had intense moments of people like ... really sad moments. And we've got this really deep montage of this happening, and the brands gone to that direction, instead of fluffy ducks, and stuff like that. Which sort of changed everything around the world, or it will eventually, so that's another one I'd say has been pretty positive. A lot. There were too many chefs in the kitchen, because we had management restructure going on at the time, creative direction restructure, so everyone had their input. So that was like ... we had three creative directors on it, which was really intense. We had a managing director on it, we had the Kleenex management on it, and then we had global management overall for the brand, which that would be T.V. org and everything because they just did not have the spot that was in a different direction of it. I wouldn't say it was the most innovative, it was just different from their brand. Wasn't very innovative, it was just a T.V. spot, but it took a 12 to 15 year brand of one direction, and we just flipped it to the other like, almost a depressing direction compared to happiness. So I mean that's what we just ... we changed their brand. Yeah, they didn't realize what was happening here, I don't think people understood the bigger picture of it, until it went overseas and then they were like, `What have you done? We've invested 15 years of a brand archetype wheel. And now you've gone here for one T.V. spot. You've changed the whole brand overnight. What have you done?` So we didn't realize the big deal of it until ... They wanted to capture what the moment was, the Kleenex moment that requires a Kleenex facial tissue. So I think they wanted us to go with the direction of time, when your son kicks a soccer ball and you're so proud of him. No, we were like no, we'll do the moment where someone learns how to walk for the first time since his car crash. Or someone's father comes home from the war, or something like ... it was all about the moment, we just made it more negative moments, than the clichéd moments. Just to do something creatively different, and just something different for the brand. It seemed like it's a really global brand, and it just seemed like a nice change. Different piece of communication for the brand. I mean if you're going to sell tissues, you're going to try and do it realistically, the idea is that facial tissue are to make people cry, so let's try and make them cry in the T.V. commercial. t was pretty tense, because we had an acting ... we had a freelancer here who used to be the creative director, so he thought he was in control of the project. And he did not get on with one of the clients, one of the main clients. He was one of the three marketing managers, and one was a woman who did not get on with the creative director and they hit heads and, yeah that wasn't very good.

He was one of the three marketing managers, and one was a woman who did not get on with the creative director and they hit heads and, yeah that wasn't very good. But the rest of them, the main client, was really excited by this new concept, this new area. He's done, I think 60 adverts for Kleenex over 30 years, and he said he's never seen anything like this and it was a new direction for the brand, and something amazing to be part of and stuff. And they were more than willing to put in an extra one hundred thousand dollars into the T.V. production in the end, which was a huge step for them. So they must've trusted us a little bit.

So it was me and someone else working on it. We came up with the concept and then those who were freelancing would overseeing it, and then he sort of took control of it, and took it to an area that we disagreed with, therefore we didn't work on it with him. Then the client had a fight with him, and then he left. Yeah, the account people didn't really help us much. Those in creative ... didn't really help us with the creative argument. At the one point where the client was wanting to back down from the advert we were trying to do, the accounts people in our office were siding on with them saying we must do what they want, which we found very upsetting because it was deterring from the original idea. Sometimes you question who they work for, the client or the agency. And then back when these guys got involved, the new creative directors, and the area changed to a direction we wanted it to go, but the suits, the account executives were back on our side, but I didn't find them too helpful to say the least. `What have you done? We've invested 15 years of a brand archetype wheel. And now you've gone here for one T.V. spot. You've changed the whole brand overnight.

No, it was too broad, and we really ... people are upset with the direction we took to begin with, because they said it's negative, and it's not happy and stuff, and it was a very broad brief, it could've been about anything. And then ironically, in the end they liked the idea and they came back to it and said they wanted that idea. But the brief wasn't very helpful in the beginning.  So they must've trusted us a little bit.   and then he sort of took control of it, and took it to an area that we disagreed with, therefore we didn't work on it with him.
