Text: I think the one thing where corner may have been cut were on the actual engineering execution of the design. Because we basically came up with the architecture for how this device would go together in a way that made sense and allowed us to realize the design we were hoping to get. Obviously very iconic itself, the round click wheel on the iPod sort of is reflected in the end caps of the speaker design, so that was an element of it that I think appealed to a lot of people in terms of creating a relationship between our product and the one that it had to work with, just visually. But I think it was combination of the round cylinder being such a simple extruded form, and yet being sort of antithetical to what people think of when they think of speakers, which is rectangular boxes. And I think it's that tension, or those two seemingly incompatible ideas working so nicely together, is what made that idea sort of exciting for all of us. And we respected the feedback that they gave to us and their priorities. That might have been the love part. The hate part was our day-to-day guy being a little bit too micro-managing, being a little bit too constantly flustered. Like if we ever called him, I'd be like, `Well you know, we're not quite ready for this review tomorrow, can we have it the next day?` And he would just be like ... You know the kind of guy, he's wedded to his GANT chart, he freaks out if something's not going exactly according to his plan. Whereas we at IDEO are thinking three steps ahead and saying, ` It takes us an extra day now to get a better result three weeks from now. Doesn't that make sense to do it that way?` But this guy was much more of a by-the-books, Type A stress case. And so having him as a day-to-day ... You know, maybe it's a good thing, that he gets us thinking about some of the stuff that we don't always think of as the highest of priorities. But on the whole I would say he probably added more stress and discomfort and unproductive anxiety to the team, I would say that would outweigh any potential positive contributions he made. And he would just be like ... You know the kind of guy, he's wedded to his GANT chart, he freaks out if something's not going exactly according to his plan. Whereas we at IDO are thinking three steps ahead and saying, ` It takes us an extra day now to get a better result three weeks from now. Doesn't that make sense to do it that way?` Something about being very explicit about that and having a client that really believed in the importance of this project must have greased the skids for us to negotiate a nice long schedule to make sure we could iterate and refine and review and incorporate all of their feedback. And test, and iterate again. And I think that's what led us to such a nice end result.   One other comment on that guy was that it was really valuable that we were cultivating this relationship with the CEO as well. Because ... And Ian was really good at this. If there was a problem in the inter-company dynamics, Ian is very diplomatic and yet effective at bringing that to the attention of people on their side who could help iron things out. Tell them call off the attack dog, or whatever. And I think that was probably a significant help, or reason for our success. Which is more and more commonly the case. And the end result on this project is sort of typical of what we see, which is that that part gets rushed, it's done by the client internally, by engineer who are not as invested in the design and what we're trying to accomplish with it. They take some shortcuts or they squeeze some cost out of it and it ends up not being quite as nice as we like to think it would've been had we done it ourselves. Of course we'll never know. Generally speaking ... A little bit of a love/hate ... the CEO and the people who only we engaged with at these very important milestones, very positive relationship. They didn't always love what we did, but they respected us as consultants, they didn't wanna second-guess every decision we made, they sort of empowered us to make the decisions we felt right most of the time, and they trusted us to do that as their advisors.
