Text: I think it was the four of us on the core team. I think Ian, who was the project manager, was really good at insulating the team from any day-to-day or short term or tactical considerations that might come up with the client. So he fielded all that kind of stuff to let the team keep thinking about big picture. And any decisions that came up in that arena, he handled without bothering us. But any questions that were about how are we thinking about this design problem, and how are we gonna give this client the best solution? That was a very democratic and respectful core team, which was nice, and just about everything was done by consensus, and it was never really divisive. I can't think of any particular incidents, but if there were disagreements within the team, Ian was strong enough leader to either moderate them to come to a mutually agreeable decision or just pull rank and say, `Look, I respect what you guys are saying, but as project leader, we need to make a direction, and it's gonna be this. So sorry if you don't like it. That's what it's gonna be.` It was high. I think it was high because they understood the spectrum of innovation, like we can take this current product and put a new skin on it, and make it look fresh and be over at this end. Or we could throw it all out the window, and do something completely new and be at this end. And they understood the risk reward of moving along that spectrum, and they helped us focus our thinking on what was appropriate. So that's not necessarily an easy thing to do, and so we were ... Those were basically the criteria, I think, that we were given. And within that, we were given pretty much free reign to explore wherever we saw fit. And think what was cool about that project was first we had just a killer team with Jerry O'Leary, who was one of our greatest, I think, industrial designers, in the company, Ian Roberts, who is one of practice leads, who's got a really strong design and engineering background. Another great designer, [Kwan 00:15:57] Chang, who is no longer with the company, and myself. I think we were sort of the core team. But I guess the really cool thing about that was the client took a very holistic approach. They were like, `Let's start with figuring out what our brand is gonna stand for, and then let's think about what are the opportunities to really express our values through design. And then let's take our time with the design and make sure we're coming up with something that's compelling, and doing solid engineering work to back that up.`  But I guess the really cool thing about that was the client took a very holistic approach. They were like, `Let's start with figuring out what our brand is gonna stand for, and then let's think about what are the opportunities to really express our values through design. And then let's take our time with the design and make sure we're coming up with something that's compelling, and doing solid engineering work to back that up.` So we laid out this really nice work plan that encompassed all those things, and we had a great core team that stayed engaged all the way from beginning to end. So I was an engineer. I wasn't leading a whole lot of the activities early on, but I was exposed to it. Also, I understood the philosophy of the project and what the client was looking for, and I was part of the whole concept generation, which I think led to stronger concepts and got me to buy into the whole direction of the project before I eventually became responsible for it. We had to get the products out the door. And then for the engineering, they asked us to design not just the aesthetics but all the interactions. And then for the engineering, they asked us to design not just the aesthetics but all the interactions. And we came up with these very animated products with lots of motion and lots of mechanism, lots of surprising behaviors that were engineering challenges, which was really kind of neat because those kinds of things had to be developed in parallel with the industrial design and the look of the products. So these guys would be coming up with concepts of what this thing should like. Together, we were coming up with the concepts for how it should behave and how things should move, and then the engineers, led by me, were responsible for coming up with figuring out how to make these behaviors happen inside this envelope that these designers were busy defining. So it was a lot of parallel effort, a lot of give and take, a lot of me as an engineer explaining to you as a designer why we can't do what you're suggesting, but we could this. And the designer's explaining to me as an engineer why that didn't fit with his design philosophy and offering other ideas about how we might be able to accomplish something similar. And maybe that's where this feeling of professional respect comes in because there's a lot of give and take and needing to be able to explain to the team what your constraints as a discipline really were in making the vision come to life. But then as a team, compiling all those things and figuring out, for the good of the project and for the strategic objectives, how are we gonna push through this in sort of a multidisciplinary way? But it was also great because it made for a very engaged management team on the client side, right? They were obviously very motivated to make this successful, and that got the CEO to the presentations. It got him invested in making sure he was making longterm, value adding decisions. And so he stayed involved, he was there, and he gave us great feedback and gave us well-informed decisions at appropriate times to allow us to keep going forward. And then there was this other guy, who was our day-to-day contact. And he was not a real effective leader, but he was the kind of guy to ... Did he really make important decisions? Not really, his role was answering any minor questions that came up along the way to make sure we could keep moving on track, which is valuable from a tactical, logistical point of view.

And so he stayed involved, he was there, and he gave us great feedback and gave us well-informed decisions at appropriate times to allow us to keep going forward. But I would say it was really the CEO who gave the strategic insight. And the designer's explaining to me as an engineer why that didn't fit with his design philosophy and offering other ideas about how we might be able to accomplish something similar.

There was a lot of mutual respect in terms of what different people were bringing to the team. In terms of stress, it felt well-balanced. It felt mutually respectful, and I think it was neat because there were challenges for all of us. The designers were challenged to come up with something new and iconic and really strategic in terms of design. It wasn't just make it look pretty. It was make it exciting, make it say something about our brand, and make it cutting edge, which was a challenge that they can really get excited about.   And so he stayed involved, he was there, and he gave us great feedback and gave us well-informed decisions at appropriate times to allow us to keep going forward.
