Title: 26 NYC Successful Boost Up (pro-bono)/ad Council Project in Pro-bono/non-profit/government industry

----

Text: Recently, we worked on this project, and Megan will probably say the same thing, the BoostUp.com project, which is, it's a product to help teenagers graduate from high school. Because there's 40% of them that aren't. They had that project going for a while under one of the creative directors here, but there was ... when we sat down, that we got put on it, and we sat down with it and realized that they needed to incorporate some dialogue and just open the whole thing up. There's this really cool opportunity to do this whole web element to it, and really tie everything together really well. It ended up being kind of, because that creative director left, very early on, and it was his baby. So, it was like okay, you know? What are we going to do? We had to talk to one of the other digital creative directors and he got involved, and then he left. It was a good and bad thing. Because on one hand, it's like we didn't have any real leadership. Nobody was doing it. Everyone kept leaving. We were the only ones that ... It was us and another team. We were the lead team and the other team wasn't really supposed to be on it, but they wanted to be. So, they were kind of helping, they were on it kind of incognito. It's been really rewarding because lately, especially it's been really taking off. And some of the messages that people are leaving, because the whole thing was meant to be, to open the dialogue between the students and the rest of the country, that the rest of the country could chime in and support them. Because a lot of times their support systems are just not there. They don't have parents- So, it allowed all these other people to have a voice and lift them up. And if you read some of the messages on the sites, they're really, really cool. All these people just ... some of them are really funny, and there's a touch of sadness to some of them. People having regrets about not graduating. But overall, it ended up having this really awesome feeling of hope, throughout the whole thing. And I think that was really cool. Some of the kids have even wrote back, being like, `Thank you so much.`- It's been really rewarding. But, it's a [inaudible 00:14:51] project. And actually the client on that is the Ad Council. They've been amazing the whole way through. But it was a really, really good experience because we didn't have anyone above us telling us, it has to be done this way. We were able to do it exactly the way we wanted to. Instead of such a dictatorship, it was ... when we were working at the web company, it was always a collaborative effort more so than a client telling the vendor what to do. And we didn't want that, because they're really good guys. The whole thing was a very, very creative, collaborative effort in the end. Which I don't know if it would have turned out that way, had there been a single person at the top, making all the decisions. Everyone had something to offer, and everyone ... me and Megan were kind of the ones that were always on it, [inaudible 00:12:50] putting out really good proofs there as well. He's awesome. And he kept everything together and made sure everyone was in the loop on everything and everyone knew what was going on. But there was only five or six people working on it. It was two teams of creatives, one producer, one account person. And that's it. That was it. For something that size, and for this agency, for something that size, for that much work, I mean, it was months of work. And the fact that we were having to do it on the down-low, because they were trying to kill it in-house, because they didn't know what was going on. We had to run in at the last ... We found out at one point that they were going to kill the whole project.   We had to run in to the CEOs office and show him all this work and be like, `Please don't kill this project.` Luckily, we were at a stage where he was able to look at it and be like, `Oh, okay. I won't kill it. I'll figure it out.` And if you read some of the messages on the sites, they're really, really cool. All these people just ... some of them are really funny, and there's a touch of sadness to some of them. People having regrets about not graduating.
