Text: The brief was important because we had to create graphics of this that I am telling you about the craving, it was very important for them for the message of the craving to be clear. So then we went through three or four concepts and in the end, as a matter of fact they kept one of the concepts they asked us to work a little bit on the art, we worked on it toward where they asked us and they rejected it. I mean first there are two people and there is one that understands us very well and that likes what we do, I mean first there are two people and there is one that understands us very well and that likes what we do, and there is another one that likes what we do but he is too complicated and he likes to impose his ideas. We have had some problems with him, he is a very insecure guy so then he also depends on this other person who doesn’t matter because he is not the one that decides but we are under the impression that he does take a lot more decisions. But we get along just fine like, “Hey how are you?” and we have a very good relationship but one of them is very insecure.  and there is another one that likes what we do but he is too complicated and he likes to impose his ideas and there is another one that likes what we do but he is too complicated and he likes to impose his ideas.

But we get along just fine like, “Hey how are you?” and we have a very good relationship but one of them is very insecure. Good, good. I have a good relationship. With accounts, also good. Good relationship because she agreed with us all of the time and she was very supportive and as I am telling you she agreed with our judgment and our approach.  But of course when the problems started to appear and we began to have some issues with the client, that is when a lot of the times. Well, what is there to do? She became more of a client than an agency, but it’s okay when things are rejected for the second with an important client, it is okay we have to just hand things in and do what you are being asked. , but it’s okay when things are rejected for the second with an important client, it is okay we have to just hand things in and do what you are being asked. Yes well we speak it terribly. No this is not what it is” I mean it was also a miscommunication issue with them, but well we worked a lot with Savory and they are a really good client but sometimes things don’t work. I mean they asked for more work and we did more work and in the end they said, “Okay then” and they presented it to their bosses and the one with the highest rank in Savory and he said no, that it was not what he was looking for. So then more changes were done based on what he wanted and neither, so then he said, “No, I don’t have anymore time I am going to do it with someone else.”   We have had some problems with him, he is a very insecure guy so then he also depends on this other person who doesn’t matter because he is not the one that decides but we are under the impression that he does take a lot more decisions. But we get along just fine like, “Hey how are you?” and we have a very good relationship but one of them is very insecure. In what sense? That we reached three or four concepts that we liked a lot and when this concept appear and we began to work it a little bit more, the three of us agreed that it was the path that we liked the most and also the one that worked best. We all agreed and when we proposed the first artwork, like it didn’t work, I mean we all agreed in a all of the development, and it was good in that sense, we all agreed in general.
