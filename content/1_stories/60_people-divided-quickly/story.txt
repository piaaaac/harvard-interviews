Title: People divided quickly

----

Text: I live in the country, I work part time in a care home. The biggest thing I've seen during this lockdown is people divided very, very quickly. Where I live, they don't want other people to come in to the countryside, which I think it's highly, highly dangerous the way things are going. At the end of the day, we've all got to share things, and people don't want to share. I've seen people being very great. But I've seen the other side of people changing really, really quickly.  I think a lot of people don't realise where I live, generations have been coming here. And even though they don't live here, they are connected here to the generations from bringing their children children to hereâ€¦ I've seen not a good sight to people.
