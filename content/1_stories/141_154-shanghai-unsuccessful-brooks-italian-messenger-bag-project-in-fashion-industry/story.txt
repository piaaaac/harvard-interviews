Text: Here in San Francisco, they think their designs are very cool and we can make it in China, but when they transferred the design package to ours, we found we cannot find the supplier to work on this project in China because that process. It's very new in China, and in San Francisco they just take it for granted, they think it's very easy. ere in San Francisco, they think their designs are very cool and we can make it in China, but when they transferred the design package to ours, we found we cannot find the supplier to work on this project in China because that process. It's very new in China, and in San Francisco they just take it for granted, they think it's very easy. Not very big, because our coworkers in San Francisco [crosstalk 00:20:22] budget is very tight, yeah. Very tight. Too tight, yeah. No time either. So the clients were very hard to deal with, and they changed their minds again and again. You know, maybe today we agreed on something and we start to spend some time working on that. Tomorrow, you know the clients, `oh, I didn't say that. You need to change that`. So he gave us very hard time, we need to bother our supplier again and again. The project very hard and the supplier would not like to work on this kind of project because volume very low. Won't make big money. Based on that situation we still changed our design again and again, so it makes the supplier very angry, and then give us very hard time. You make a competition between ours and the supplier very hard. The client was not very consistent. Yeah I don't think it's good. For this project, if a coworker in San Francisco shared more information with us earlier we probably can do it much better. At least we can advise them earlier, you know, we cannot make it in China. It won't [inaudible 00:26:30] that long time. On other occasions, the people there they are very reluctant to share information with us. Shanghai is very new, they think the people here is very new, and they're not experienced enough sometimes. So I think to get the project better in the future, get involved earlier and share more information with us, and have more confidence in us. Definitely will help Yeah I don't think it's good.

I spent a long time looking for suppliers around China but finally, none of them can make the prototype very well, and we said sorry to the client. We said we cannot make it in China, and another supplier from Italy get our design to Europe and get them made there. So I think the client was not very happy. I think it's very bad to me, to IDEO either. Yes, in 2006 I worked on a project a client is from Italy. So our project is about some messenger bags, [inaudible 00:17:56] bags, and IDEO helped them with the design from San Francisco and Shanghai. Me help them look for suppliers gets their prototype out. Because when IDEO San Francisco start the design, they didn't notice ours. We didn't know what they are working, and we didn't know it was this kind of project we all need to work on. Here in San Francisco, they think their designs are very cool and we can make it in China, but when they transferred the design package to ours, we found we cannot find the supplier to work on this project in China because that process. It's very new in China, and in San Francisco they just take it for granted, they think it's very easy.

For this project, if a coworker in San Francisco shared more information with us earlier we probably can do it much better. At least we can advise them earlier, you know, we cannot make it in China. I think they got some inspiration from the swimming suit, or from... Many people who would like to go camping and swim on the mountains, camp, and even it's raining, they can wear it and waterproof jacket right? Waterproof jacket walking in the rain. They got some inspiration from. Want to design some bags which are waterproofing as well, and you can put the bag in water. The water cannot go into the bag, the bag protects the stuff inside very well.   You know, when one of my coworkers Jessie moved back to Palo Alto, and I had a phone conference with the client. The way that the client talk is not very polite. Because you know, French when they speak English is very hard to understand. We ask them to repeat it, and they kind of were not patient. Oh can I say this in this way? o the clients were very hard to deal with, and they changed their minds again and again. You know, maybe today we agreed on something and we start to spend some time working on that. Tomorrow, you know the clients, `oh, I didn't say that. You need to change that`. So he gave us very hard time, we need to bother our supplier again and again. The project very hard and the supplier would not like to work on this kind of project because volume very low. Tight, schedule tight.
