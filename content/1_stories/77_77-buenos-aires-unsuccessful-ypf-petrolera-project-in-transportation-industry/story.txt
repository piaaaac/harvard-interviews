Text: It was a very exhausting process because the client was not entirely happy with the agency, they wanted a change of agency; the relationship got to a point were things were no longer okay.  I came into the agency to work in that last part and it was the worst part of the process, because they were constantly asking for new campaign alternatives and they never approved one, and it was very exhausting because we worked for many days and many nights we slept in our houses during the day and we continued working. No time was normal, the right one for the project. The budget was large. No the agency started working normally with the project that they had requested and we worked for two months and approximately, during the process, the agency began to notice that there were other issues, that it was not just a creativity issue.  So then they exhausted people who overworked and they were never going to accept the proposal. To change?  Well, I don’t know I came in at the very end of the process and there was an agency at the moment which was ________ and they were very popular at the moment and they were landing very large projects and they had like a certain freshness. t was a very exhausting process because the client was not entirely happy with the agency, they wanted a change of agency; the relationship got to a point were things were no longer okay.  I came into the agency to work in that last part and it was the worst part of the process, because they were constantly asking for new campaign alternatives and they never approved one, and it was very exhausting because we worked for many days and many nights we slept in our houses during the day and we continued working. It was a month and half that was very exhausting that finally got nowhere, so it was a process that I remember, because I personally felt trapped because I had all of my energy focused on that, I had just entered the agency and I could not leave it so quickly.  I didn’t have time to even explore any alternatives, I couldn’t stop working, I mean it was exhausting for everyone who worked there and for me it was very exhausting. But when the project finally came out with another agency they did have like a higher tolerance, they weren’t very open to ideas with our agency. With the agency, I mean it was very confusing; I mean there wasn’t anything clear. But when the project finally came out with another agency they did have like a higher tolerance, they weren’t very open to ideas with our agency. It wasn’t good.  It wasn’t good because they didn’t analyze the proposal objectively because they had another problem with the agency, the relationship wore out and they had the intention to work with another agency, and they weren’t’ very clear for a very long time and they made the agency work a lot and they didn’t use that work afterwards. Yes, I mean it was weird because a lot of people outside the agency had to be called in to work.  We worked a lot of weekends and entire weeks, we were all quite tolerant because we were all a little bit tired and upset.   Oh the client.  Well, I believe that if they were going to make the choice or already had made the choice to change agencies they should have said that first instead of giving the project to the agency.
