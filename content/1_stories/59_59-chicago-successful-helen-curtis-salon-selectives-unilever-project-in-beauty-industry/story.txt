Title: 59 CHICAGO Successful Helen Curtis/Salon Selectives/Unilever Project in Beauty industry

----

Text: Girls could be inspired by anything around them and then we would create these really cool hairstyles that matched what they had seen. It was transformative and the products themselves were really niched into what that hairstyle was. It was just really fun and we were using all kinds of film influences and we had started a group called the chick click, which was a website, which was a web based kind of focus group of all these girls in their 20s talking about hair and stuff in their lives. It was just very ahead of its time. I mean this was like before Facebook and all that stuff. We just got a lot of consumer influenced art direction and stories basically. It was just really fun. Super fun. Beauty's always fun. Yeah, but it was done in a way that it was like listening to these girls talk to each other, so it wasn't like the traditional focus group of asking questions and showing them work. It was these little cliques of girls talking to each other and just us kind of listening in and hearing what motivates them and what they think is cool. It just gave us a lot of really rich territory for really how sophisticated they were. You know even these young girls were like being inspired by Herb Ritts and Walter Yost type portraits. Things that you would think they wouldn't even ... that wouldn't even be on their radar. Yeah. They're actually not ... they ended up harvesting that brand and turning it into SunSilk, which is kind of what they do. They'll create a brand and then ... ThermaSilk and them kind of merged. They're pretty smart. They think of their hair care stuff kind of like bars and restaurants and people are only interested in them for so long and then they kind of morph them into different ideas, because basically girls just want to try different stuff all the time. Each one was to do a different task. You know either ... I mean all the basics, but in reality they were ... what we came up with was to create different hairdos inspired by things you would see around you and this particular product helps you do that hairdo. It was a lot of brand talking to girls about their own creativity and their own inspiration. Really shampoos and hair companies hadn't really tapped into what you could do. I mean they're always talking at you and how beautiful you should look, but these were all designed. It was a campaign called see it, do it. It was just really fun and we were using all kinds of film influences and we had started a group called the chick click, which was a website, which was a web based kind of focus group of all these girls in their 20s talking about hair and stuff in their lives.
