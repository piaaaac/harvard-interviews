Title: Successful Needle-less injector/Red jet Project in Medical industry

Text: The nicest thing that I remember about that project was that it was being run by a man in his middle ... with a family. He's older and so he was very careful to make ... He was going home every day at 5:00 which was just really refreshing, because I don't even remember what I worked on previous to that, but we definitely had lots of late nights, and ever since then I've had lots of late nights, so that sticks out in my mind as being nice. They were a little bit still figuring out some of the science and technology behind as in how long you would have to hold this applicator, some of those specs around things like that. How big certain things were going to be, but for the most part, they were able to give us enough constraints to work with I guess. Another nice thing about the project was that the makeup of the team because there were these two really senior people that totally knew what they were doing, and they had done tons and tons of health projects, that was a really awesome learning experience for me. Amy is our health practice human factors researcher and I don't know if you've met her, but she's a very strong personality. She has really strong opinions about the way things should be done. She's very orderly ... Yeah, I just remember it seemed like we had a lot of time. There wasn't a lot of pressure the way that some of the other project seem really, really fast paced and that was nice. Mark went on vacation for two weeks at some point during it and so it left the whole project up to me and Erin, the other girl, and that was right when we were doing all this prototyping and we were about to go back into the field to get user feedback from people. She and I had never really dealt with vendors before and all this large scale prototyping but we totally nailed it. It was really fun and it gave us a little empowerment I guess, and a little taste of managing a little bit because we had some other interns that were working for us. We were the ones calling the shots and working with the vendors and changing drawings and fixing them and making sure everything was here and keeping track of everything. That was a little stressful but a lot of fun. I don't think so. I was less involved at that point with a lot of the budget and project leadership stuff, so I wasn't real aware of how things were going, but as far as I know it was all fine and we had ample everything.

It was actually very heartbreaking going to their houses, because these were people that were living with major, major pain for long periods of time and people that were ... they reminded you of your mom. This one woman, she had a son in high school, and they told her that she wasn't going to live to see his graduation, but she had lived to see his graduation and she was ... I still remember sitting in her kitchen with her and her crying and telling us about how if this thing was to work, just what it would mean for her to be able to go out and do things in the last months of her life. That was pretty motivating.
