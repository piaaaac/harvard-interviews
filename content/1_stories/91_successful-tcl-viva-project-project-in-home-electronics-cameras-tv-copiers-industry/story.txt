Title: Successful TCL Viva project Project in Home electronics/cameras/TV/copiers industry

----

Text: Although they said they had very big tolerance, but in reality, I think it's not because they regarded IDEO as we're a class consultant and they spent a huge amount of money on us. It is my impression that while we visited their company to do the presentation, they always get a huge conference room and the whole company come over to that room. I'm exaggerating, but it's like 40-something people from all the key people or the most successful employers from each division to participate the presentation. Then, they will always tend to, from my perspective based on their manufacturing capability, and also based on their maturity in terms of handling branding and their business, it's better to provide them something lower risk because you providing something really special. They can handle it. Yeah. The phase two part is still in Palo Alto and they are working on ... Actually, sometimes, I feel they don't really have the capability to react to the research part because, basically, they are not sophisticated in terms of marketing and branding and they barely had any marketing research department at all, so every time our experience, like a comer is me or Lucy, went to them and give them presentation and they go like oh, wow. That's interesting. Hm. All right. Because it actually is the third project we did for TCL. The first one we did was just about premium T.V. It's called [Redox 00:21:31] and the second one was called Retail. Viva was the third one, so to that point, we already understand part of their company's expectations and their goals and in the project brief ... I feel it's okay. Yeah. It's not that tight. There's a reason why I picked that project because the rest of the projects I did were very tight. But, the only pity I felt is the budget wise. We didn't have enough budget to involve the whole team all the time. So, I'll describe you a sequence of who joined and who leave. One important thing is, I felt, is to show ideas to people and to contemplate what that means. Also, within a very short period of time, brainstorming around that topic, but for this it's more like we know where our goal is and we just marched toward it. We didn't really have much space to think out of the box or to talk about it. It more like everybody did their own thing and put them together at the very end. I felt, because it's our third project we did for them, so they already started to feel familiar with us and feel us less threatening, especially, for example, their industrial design has. So, that's a good part. I'll say it's pretty good because I remember when I did Redux, which is the first project the head of industrial designer, she came with me and then that time her attitude was very challenging. And she will said there's nothing interesting from the field, but during Viva, she quite enjoy it. Then, I actually realized her attitude changed and then she more see IDEO as a partner to cooperate with instead of to compete against. I feel they don't really have the capability to react to the research part because, basically, they are not sophisticated in terms of marketing and branding and they barely had any marketing research department at all, so every time our experience, like a comer is me or Lucy, went to them and give them presentation and they go like oh, wow. That's interesting. Hm. All right. So, they were almost like looking up at us like looking at some hero and then they want to learn from that hero and dream maybe one day they can become the hero or, at least, something similar to the hero, so they all want to learn something from us. I think our main sponsor, he gave us lots of trust, but that trust will not fail. Then, one day, with IDEO's help, they can become as good as Samsung, so I would say it's very well. felt, because it's our third project we did for them, so they already started to feel familiar with us and feel us less threatening, especially, for example, their industrial design has. So, that's a good part. I'll say it's pretty good because I remember when I did Redux, which is the first project the head of industrial designer, she came with me and then that time her attitude was very challenging.

Then, I actually realized her attitude changed and then she more see IDEO as a partner to cooperate with instead of to compete against. It's for our key client TCL and then what we are going to deliver, first of all, is to help to sell to supplement their products from a user behavioral point of view. At the same time, we also did lots of looking in sessions and to understand what the company's capabilities are. So for those two aspect. Also, we need to give suggestions of some complementary accessories, so that's the project is about. I think that's something very interesting because although they signed the contract, but when we did the workshop in Palo Alto, they all of a sudden proposed other 10 things they also want to do. Originally, the project was focused on China and then, during the workshop, they say oh, by the way, we are also interested in France. Now they just say we are also interested in Europe and the U.S.A. Can you also do research for us in those two areas? And then, besides the product segmentation, can you do the brand part at the same time, and that's how we push back. We did enlarge our research group scope to incorporate France and U.S.A. briefly, but we didn't do the brand part. We still focused on T.V., but I felt that also declined. They didn't really think through what they accept and then when they feel excited, they will suggest something else. And they will give more ... the feedback will increase while the process go into later phases. So, for example, if it's start to have something visual, they will have more things to interact with, and even later, for a simply manufacturing process, they will suddenly become expert and they don't want to accept our suggestions. I think, basically, our learning from people and also from the discussion with the teams because, for example, Suzanne, she came from the State and then she had many other project experiences, so she can enlarge our territory while we did a discussion. So, the information from people isn't the only source we have, and also we learned a lot from talking to the client as well as from our design study.  So, from my side, they are always very happy, but for me, at the very beginning, I feel disappointed because I feel they didn't give me any feedback. And then, gradually, I realized it's not because they don't want, just they can't, so I feel our role here is more like to tell the client direction instead of asked or cultivate the direction with them. After the research phase, the designers in Palo Alto, they can take those things we found out to further develop their ideas and concepts around that. So, for example, Ken, the Project Manager, or the industrial designers, they come on their team all the time and they always come in and out while they have time or we have extra resource to put them on the team. Also, we need to split and do many things in parallel without proper time to sit down together and do something together because I mentioned about creativity.
