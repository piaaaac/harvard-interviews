Text: Pretty good actually. I mean, I suppose it was from - we had the benefit of the marketing manager's brother worked with us as well. It was kind of that sort of, prior relationship. But I can't say that that added to everything though. It's just nice people. And they seemed to trust us and listen to what we're saying and that was sort of switched on as well. They weren't afraid to, sort of go `Oh God no. We have to do it like this?` They were ready to hear what you had to say. So that's cool. I don't know for this specific project, it got tense at one point. But that was pretty much it. And I think that was more between like production and service not communicating and about getting it out on time and that kind of thing. So it wasn't really the creative. And while the client had lots of restrictions, we had to use the doggy lips. We knew that from the beginning and basically worked with that and it went pretty smoothly. We had a lot of media to cover with it which was, kind of, one of the problems to start with but worked out really well. We had to still do that [inaudible 00:01:33], the really big ones. So then, everything had a separate style as well so we had to shoot to that. That was something to around, but the client was just awesome all the way through it. Made such a huge difference. It was pretty low actually. 'Cause I mean they said they wanted their dog in there. So it's kind of like - came out with some pretty cool campaigns for a tough camera which is an awesome proposition, but then I said we had to have the dog in there because they became attached to the dog last year or something and it had to be used all the way through. So that kind of like brought it down a bit, the use of light because there's only so much that a dog can do. That kind of narrowed it. So we kind of, pushed the grade on it and tried to make it look as cool as possible. Because it could've so easily just been like a flat image of - you know. Boring dog and that kind of thing, but we managed to work out okay. We did like - we pushed the dog as far as it could. So we made the dog have personality and it was kind of like, cool 'cause it messed up this whole room but the camera was fine. So that was our concept. And you have fun with that. And so we had like, a picture of it with the camera in it's mouth and like, shaking it all around so it really became like an art original thing other than anything else. So that kind of like brought it down a bit, the use of light because there's only so much that a dog can do. That kind of narrowed it.   They weren't afraid to, sort of go `Oh God no. We have to do it like this?` They were ready to hear what you had to say. So that's cool.
