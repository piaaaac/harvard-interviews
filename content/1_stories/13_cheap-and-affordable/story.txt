Title: Cheap and affordable

----

Text: My food story is trying to find cheap and affordable ways to reduce my plastic and also the distance my food has travelled (local produce is the goal, and refill stations). So far, I have been making small swaps that are achievable for someone living on a student budget. I have also been trying to rediscover my love for food, mainly through trying to find healthy recipes and tasty treats.
