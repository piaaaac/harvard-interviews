Text: You know? Because it kind of got to the finishing process, and then that nervousness and that fear kicked in everything kind of flip flopped together against us, and we had to alter into a state that was not- Yeah. But, overall, it was ... I would say it was a positive scenario for us in that we were brought in last minute, we had to come up with something very quickly, and we were like, well let's just try this kind of weird idea for them, and they really liked ... It was almost like we walked in, when we went to present it, I'm like, they're gonna hate this. Because this is just not what they're about, but let's just go in and see what happens, and we did. We went in there and presented, and they really wanted the agency to bring them something that was different- The agency had been bringing them crap for so long. They were just, like, excited, they were like, yes, let's do it. The meeting, we presented it, the meeting's like, okay, and within the day, they're like, we're doing it, we're getting it done, and you know, that rarely ever happens. It was kind of timing, I think was in our favor, and a client that was hungry for taking a chance, because they'd been so conservative for so long. It was, once again, I'd say pretty nonexistent. We really didn't have much of a brief. Yeah, it was ... Trying to think of what it was. It was one of those kind of things were they were trying to put too much in it, we were trying to simplify it, make it work. Which, sometimes the generic brief works in your favor, I think, because then it's ... Favorable is when you can interpret that brief many ways, and you can sell a lot of different campaigns in. That kind of like, can answer to that brief, because it's not pinpointed. And I'd say a bad thing is when ... Sometimes too focused, and too narrow that it can only lead you down one path, and if you do anything off that path, it's like, the client will think it's ... So yeah, there is such a thing as too narrow and too wide. Yeah, we had a week, maybe, to work on it? Yeah. I would say it was ... I've had worse. I would say it was medium to crazy, you know what I mean? Somewhere in between being crazy and ... It was medium. Average budget. Some music and ... We didn't want to do what they'd always done. They had kind of a formulaic way of doing things, where they had all these copy points that ... Just stilted, copy, you know? Yeah, we actually used ... We knew we didn't want to do dialogue. Because their dialogue was really bad, and it was really, I like things with ... That are tasty, you know what I mean? So we looked at it, and we looked at what they were doing, we said, how can we not have to do that- We're not doing that. They were really looking for something different than what they'd been doing. But I think over the years, because of their research techniques, it always forced them into doing a thing a certain way. You know, because that's what tested, you know, and I think because we hadn't been working on it, we'd never worked on it before, we were really bringing fresh perspective to it, because we didn't know the rules, you know. And we were gonna break the rules, because we knew. Because we decided up front, it was part of our inspiration was not to do what had been done and to totally avoid it, because we knew it would end up bad if we did it. So that was kind of, like, you know. They were good. I think there was some in-fighting on the client- They would fight a little bit, but they did disagree with each other a little bit ... But ultimately, there was, you know, the person above that saying, disregard everything, which most of the good projects we've ever worked on, there's been the one true decision maker.  Yeah, in the case of Kraft, there's always someone that's up ... Is not involved in the day-to-day that has nothing to do with anything, that's just a figurehead. And then they have all this veto power over anything, even though they aren't involved with it, you know, and then people we've never even seen or heard of, you know? It's a good thing if you know the person, and you know- And they're hands-off. Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah, it was really good, actually. They were really behind the work. They were more excited about it than we were.
