Title: Vulnerable people

----

Text: We set up a pick, pack and delivery service in response to Covid-19 which saw up to 500 orders a week being processed, on an island with 4500 full time residents. We have employed extra shop and delivery staff and also worked closely with community groups to identify vulnerable people and arrange food delivery. Also, we moved the foodshare (in conjunction with Arran Eco Savvy) instore for the time being to ensure food waste minimisation activities continue throughout the pandemic period.
