Title: 55 CHICAGO Unsuccessful Geisinger Care Works start-up in-store medical clinics (GCW and pharma company) Project in Medical industry

----

Text: So the brief was they had five stores and they weren't yet making any money and they had done some research that nobody in the industry was really making any money and they were saying, `So, [inaudible 00:29:08], could you help us figure out what our service offer is that's going to be appropriate and differentiate in the marketplace?` Because they were considering besides just doing a acute care things, like when a kid has a sore throat, is it Strep? Considering like should we do cosmetic things like Botox or should we do massages or should we do nutritional counseling, I mean, they had no idea what they should do to sort of just get beyond this sort of nurse in a box mentality, which clearly wasn't making anybody any money. And ultimately, people like minute clinic in Target and Walmart are going to do better at that because they've got scale. So, they knew that wasn't going to work, so that's the brief, what should our service [inaudible 00:29:55] be? We went, `Great. We can help you with that.` It was two clients that it wasn't even apparent in the beginning, so it was the Care Works sort of head of this group, plus it was partly funded by a pharmaceutical company, and we weren't clear at the beginning how they had an agenda that was slightly different from ... So we sort of had two clients that wasn't clear upfront as the brief is done what their relationship was, they weren't quite clear to us about it, there was a little bit of sort of like ambiguity there, so that was a bad setup. We had a client contact that was I think he wasn't super, super sharp in the sense he had good perspective. So that as the project went forward, he kept on not understanding that you do a strategy that's pure, that has a very strong point of view, versus he's dealing with, `What am I doing next week with my sign up sheets in my clinics?` So he couldn't let go of the day to day- They had different ... As things started evolving, they went different directions about what they thought was important and as opposed to reconciling those differences along with a coherent vision, they started working independently. So, this is one of those things like particularly when you get into service clients that are ... I always tell my clients, `If you really want to do innovation, you have to let go of operations and focus on strategy.` And having that person who just couldn't let go of the operations influenced the team, the [inaudible 00:32:42] team, and sort of held them back. And there were a couple clear moments where we had some good insights about what it means to do this sort of supportive care direction and that the nurses in these boxes were sort of doing it but were getting acknowledged for it, it wasn't part of their brand, [inaudible 00:33:02] and they said the client really bought in on the sort of supportive care direction even though it wasn't new, we sort of had some good reasoning for what it really meant. They had thought of supportive care and stuff like that but we said that this is the direction for you, it really fits with who you are, it fits with what your nurses are doing, and it fits with being in a grocery store because you have things like the props around the grocery store to use as ways to sort of talk about lifestyle changes and things like that. So, thought that that was a really good fit. Now, the problem is is that it takes you in a direction that has a different business model, it takes you on ... They were very focused on the 15 minute visit because that's their business model, supportive care takes you on a pathway of 30 and 60 minute visits, also takes you on the pathway of having maybe two people in a facility. So as we started developing concepts, the client pushed back on, `No, it doesn't fit our business model, we can't go that way.` They were very focused on the 15 minute visit because that's their business model, supportive care takes you on a pathway of 30 and 60 minute visits, also takes you on the pathway of having maybe two people in a facility. So as we started developing concepts, the client pushed back on, `No, it doesn't fit our business model, we can't go that way.` The fact that the client sort of pushed back, the team said, `Okay, well we can't do the two nurse things, so let's go this way.` So they were sort of comprising what they were doing. And the response was, by one team member, `We're still going to have to talk about supportive care, but not all the way over here.` And the other one says, `Well, let's give them some value by helping them fix some of their day to day issues.` And so that the fact that we ... Okay, so just two different clients, responses are different, so you end up with ... You know, a real innovation has to take something and really push it all the way. And you get all these factors that sort of get in the way as barriers and you end up with [inaudible 00:35:16] as hard as you can. Then you end up with something that in the end, yeah, we gave them some good recommendations how to improve what they're doing but it's not going to set them on this really differentiate offer to the marketplace. Which may have been hard to do, but it's going to be differentiated, which is what they asked us for. I did part of the up front sort of business development and worked with them because I had worked and I said rightly that I would be involved but I was quite busy and couldn't be as involved as I would've liked, I couldn't do all the field research, I couldn't be at every single meeting. I went into the field a couple days just to sort of see their offer and I was at most of the meetings but not all of them. I think part of like compare contrast to PNC, that when they made a decision, they felt good about just moving on, made the decision, we felt good about it, we're going to move on. The Care Works people, both they were second guessing themselves all the time. You know. They couldn't make a decision and move on, they kept on returning to things that had been discussed and we thought had been decided and they kept returning to them again and bringing them up over and over and over again. They just can't leave things behind. They weren't sure how to navigate their own organization on what was going to be valuable to them, frankly. I think was low in a sense that it was actually quite risk averse because the fact that he wasn't even willing to consider a different business model, which wasn't even that big a stretch. There are other people, players in the marketplace that had a two person staffing model and he wasn't willing to consider it because he sort of was afraid of the investment cost. So I think it was low. He was very risk averse. He really couldn't take the plunge into actually considering something radically different. He asked for it but really couldn't go there. The brief was, `What should our service [inaudible 00:41:03] be?` But then they kept changing what they wanted. So one thing that inspired us is really trying to understand what would motivate doctors to want to partner with these things and what kind of relationship and role. So I think it was really looking at the balance between the different stakeholders, I think that really sort of inspired this direction. So I think in this particular case it was really a good sort of understanding of the whole picture, of sort of the stakeholder, the relationships between the various stakeholders that could be if you thought about an offer, that really thought about those relationships to support those relationships and the communication between them. That you could have something really differentiate. So, but again, to pull it off was a radical leap because the client reaction was, `Well, it's going to take a long time to establish those relationships and they don't trust us now.` Well, duh. Are you trying to do something differentiate or not? Really just not good. It was difficult discussions, people returning to issues that were left, couldn't move on, not clear decision making on their end, and frankly, we didn't necessarily push them to make those decisions sometimes, so it's not all their fault. Yeah, they had a breakdown, which had to have an intervention but they repaired and completed the project. They weren't talking to each other. They literally were like significant like statements like, `We can do this, we can deal with this later, but right now we just have to sort of work apart.` And then I actually intervened and facilitated a reconciliation before the end of the project that helped the team get back together and sort of acknowledge their tensions and the [inaudible 00:46:24] of their tensions and to move on and that did work They literally were like significant like statements like, `We can do this, we can deal with this later, but right now we just have to sort of work apart.` And then I actually intervened and facilitated a reconciliation before the end of the project that helped the team get back together and sort of acknowledge their tensions and the [inaudible 00:46:24] of their tensions and to move on and that did work. And then I actually intervened and facilitated a reconciliation before the end of the project that helped the team get back together and sort of acknowledge their tensions and the [inaudible 00:46:24] of their tensions and to move on and that did work. Well, I think it was a different, they started, since there was confusing about exactly what the final endpoint would be, whether it was more is it for helping to get what they're going to do next month or help them with their overall strategy, [inaudible 00:46:49] the team, they were mixed, so the response for the team was different. So since they were frustrated with the client, one team member said, `Well, we just have to make it more actionable, we have to do more prototyping around these very near term things that they can use right away.` And the other person said, `Screw that, that's not going to be valuable to them, we really need to do this.` And they disagreed on how to handle the response to the client. So they started- Right, since the client was unclear, the team became unclear and then they disagreed and then they didn't resolve it and there was ... And I don't know the whole history or the detail about how the breakdown happened but it was, I guess, it was just sort of a bad day can lead to a worst day where something was said and then it comes into personal relationships about having perspective about. But when there's so much confusion about where you're heading, that can cause the team to have anxiety anyway. Right, it exacerbates it, so then it became a little bit of ... You know, personal style [inaudible 00:48:07] at this point because you're not, there's already some tension, there's some uneasiness, there's some anxiety, there's a client issue, and then a personal style thing can have more importance. Like how people communicate or don't communicate well or how do people handle tension. Some people close up and some people will lash out. And the personal style things, they start to come up when the team isn't functioning. Well, I would say there were a little bit because the two people having the most tension were both very experienced people, both of them had been here for 10 years or more, so they were both in their own right were experienced, either one of them could've really set the direction for this. It turns out they just, they couldn't reconcile between the two of them. So in a sense it wasn't power as much as they both knew what's right, they were both very confident that what they thought was right.  So in a sense it wasn't power as much as they both knew what's right, they were both very confident that what they thought was right. . So we sort of had two clients that wasn't clear upfront as the brief is done what their relationship was, they weren't quite clear to us about it, there was a little bit of sort of like ambiguity there, so that was a bad setup So that as the project went forward, he kept on not understanding that you do a strategy that's pure, that has a very strong point of view, versus he's dealing with, `What am I doing next week with my sign up sheets in my clinics?` So he couldn't let go of the day to day- He couldn't let go of the day to day operations of his five clinics were up and running from the fact that we were looking for sort of a longer term sort of strategic direction for them. So, that sets up a very bad dynamic because you can't serve both things equally well. And then we ended up having a team that didn't function very well. They had different ... As things started evolving, they went different directions about what they thought was important and as opposed to reconciling those differences along with a coherent vision, they started working independently. So, this is one of those things like particularly when you get into service clients that are ... I always tell my clients, `If you really want to do innovation, you have to let go of operations and focus on strategy.` And having that person who just couldn't let go of the operations influenced the team, the [inaudible 00:32:42] team, and sort of held them back. `No, it doesn't fit our business model, we can't go that way.` And so that's sort of like taking the insight, developing a concept, and then really following all the way through. The fact that the client sort of pushed back, the team said, `Okay, well we can't do the two nurse things, so let's go this way.` So they were sort of comprising what they were doing. And the response was, by one team member, `We're still going to have to talk about supportive care, but not all the way over here.` And the other one says, `Well, let's give them some value by helping them fix some of their day to day issues.` And so that the fact that we ... Okay, so just two different clients, responses are different, so you end up with ... You know, a real innovation has to take something and really push it all the way. And you get all these factors that sort of get in the way as barriers and you end up with [inaudible 00:35:16] as hard as you can. The Care Works people, both they were second guessing themselves all the time. You know. They couldn't make a decision and move on, they kept on returning to things that had been discussed and we thought had been decided and they kept returning to them again and bringing them up over and over and over again. They just can't leave things behind. Well, they were senior in a sense but they ... Innovation groups have to sort of respect their sponsors in a way, they're in the service of the larger organization, so at the end, this is where they worked there at the beginning, who all the stakeholders were, they got nervous because they weren't sure whether their stakeholders in the pharma organization were going to like what we were doing. Or was this work getting them what they needed. But they never explained that to us in the beginning. So, they had sort of unseen stakeholders, unseen to us. There are other people, players in the marketplace that had a two person staffing model and he wasn't willing to consider it because he sort of was afraid of the investment cost. So I think it was low. He was very risk averse. He really couldn't take the plunge into actually considering something radically different. He asked for it but really couldn't go there. Well, they said, `Can you help us figure out what our check in procedures should be?` It's sort of like, it's like they wouldn't let it stay at the strategic level, they kept on sort of going back in the tactical level and so again, it's sort of like they couldn't separate their current operations, what they needed to fix tomorrow, from where they should be going in the future. And so it was a constant problem for the team. I think that it could've been budgeted bigger, I think they sort of had a budget and we sort of worked with their budget, so I think ideally it would've been a little bit more time because it is sort of a business strategy. I think that time to some degree that there's more clarity, it would've been enough time but the fact that there were so many of these issues that sort of wasted the team's time, they didn't maybe get as far as they should have, could have. And there's history of this happening all over ... And every single time because the doctors don't trust and they hate these minute clinics. Really just not good. It was difficult discussions, people returning to issues that were left, couldn't move on, not clear decision making on their end, and frankly, we didn't necessarily push them to make those decisions sometimes, so it's not all their fault. We have to take responsibility sometimes for not framing things in a way that the decision has to be made before you move on. They literally were like significant like statements like, `We can do this, we can deal with this later, but right now we just have to sort of work apart.` And then I actually intervened and facilitated a reconciliation before the end of the project that helped the team get back together and sort of acknowledge their tensions and the [inaudible 00:46:24] of their tensions and to move on and that did work. PROJECT ID `Well, we just have to make it more actionable, we have to do more prototyping around these very near term things that they can use right away.` And the other person said, `Screw that, that's not going to be valuable to them, we really need to do this.` And they disagreed on how to handle the response to the client. So they started- Right, it exacerbates it, so then it became a little bit of ... You know, personal style [inaudible 00:48:07] at this point because you're not, there's already some tension, there's some uneasiness, there's some anxiety, there's a client issue, and then a personal style thing can have more importance.   It turns out they just, they couldn't reconcile between the two of them. So in a sense it wasn't power as much as they both knew what's right, they were both very confident that what they thought was right.
