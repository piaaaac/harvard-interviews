Title: 227 CAPE TOWN Unsuccessful Smirnoff Experience Project in Alcohol industry

----

Text: We went crazy and they loved what we came up with and then we actually got to the point where we were pretty much designing the interiors for every single building in the town and saying, banks going to look like this and this and then it was on the third review and then the client said,` Whoa, I think that the experience is overpowering Smirnoff.` We were like, but it's supposed to be huge. Not what you want now. Cuz you made me turn it down and then in the meeting they were like Heineken threw a party last week for $2 million. Why can't we do something for $2 million instead of ... I think the budget was $7 or something. We were like, but um, you know don't you throw parties all the time? This is supposed to be the huge experience. This isn't just a party, because nobody's talking about the Heineken party that happened a week ago. Nobody, because this happens all the time. We were pretty much completely destroyed and heartbroken. Then the feed back we got back was, okay so we're having a party and we need to come up with a theme and an act. We were like they have events companies that can do that. We're an ad agency. I think that was the worst brief ever. Well, worst job ever. The meeting we were in had seven people in it. Which, was probably why it collapsed, because there were just hundreds of different views and they all sort of took a strange negative tone and then snowballed and then it turned out to be completely disastrous when it didn't need to be. Yeah. I can't remember her name but it was one who was supposed to be like the head honcho. Out of 10 I'd give them a four, because they really want to but then every time it's there it gets pulled back. The whole thing is a Smirnoff original like different. That's kind of the brand vibe and they keep saying, `It needs to be original. It needs to be something that's never been done before but make it crap.` They really contradict themselves all the time. But then they just seem to be a little to scared to go there. So I don't really understand what more they need to do. It seems like they're there but they're just a little too afraid to let go. I guess that's it. Yeah, like you have $7 million for the whole campaign this isn't really going to work. Budget was stupid. I think it was like ... It had the potential to be the most amazing job I've ever done. I think it was exciting because it wasn't just ads and layouts and whatever. It was more like. It was like coming up with a whole experience and I'm quite into interior design and industrial design and things so it was very exciting to come up with what the place is going to look like. I had so much fun planning it. It just seemed like we weren't getting through to them because ... It was really frustrating because we felt like we totally onto their brief but they won't see it like. It seemed like there was some weird communication barrier. I wasn't allowed to talk in the meeting and I was just so frustrated because I could have totally answered their questions and then like you said you want this and we'll put it here but then I kept getting shushed in the meeting. I don't know. Con was very ... every time they said ... Con just put his hand out like shut the fuck up. I was like, okay. He kind of spoke but he didn't get it across properly and that's what I've noticed a lot. I've often been in presentations or meetings with clients where ... we're just have misfiring communications and it snowballs from there. It becomes a complete flop where it could just be a little answer that you put across differently. The one thing we went into where ... Cuz Paul's just kind of moved up to take Doug's place for a bit and we went to a Smirnoff meeting kind of like pitching an idea and they liked it but they were just so confused that they ended up bombing half of it when it didn't need to be because they kept saying, `What about the off con stuff,` even though it was like an on con event. They kept saying, `What about the off con stuff.` We thought, shit, was that not in the brief that we were supposed to do off con stuff. Paul was like, `We can totally do off con stuff we just put stickers on instead of this. Then they were like, `Why?` And then we were like, `Because you [inaudible 00:35:46].` Yeah. It was very ahhhh. When we could have just said no. It's an on con thing like you said in the brief. Here's what we've done and Bob's your uncle. It just went horribly wrong. It was like watching a car accident. It was like waiiiiiit. Whoa. This is totally not going the right ... yeah it was terrible. That happens a lot and that happened to the biggest degree on the Smirnoff job. They were like, `But where is Smirnoff in this whole thing?` It was pretty much like we were coming up with interior design not like integrating Smirnoff at the time because obviously branding things with Smirnoff's going to be pretty easy but coming up with the exterior of a building is going to be a little more tricky. That's what they'd have to approve. They wouldn't have to approve the big Smirnoff sign on the building because that's pretty much a given and they didn't see any branding on the things. So they started freaking out like where's Smirnoff going to be in this whole town and we were like but you don't understand we're just showing you look and feel for everything so that you can approve it and it just went whoa, this town is taking over. There's no Smirnoff and we were like, ahhh. It was horrible. It was him and Lisa and then Lisa came into one of our brainstorm sessions and she was like, `Oh did you guys know that the venue has been canned?` And we were like what. What. And then she was like, `Oh, didn't Neil tell you a week ago?` It was very irritating. That was very good, smooth going. It was just like here's what we think you'll love and then he was like `Yeah, this probably isn't in line. Can that little building but I like this one and sort of worked together really well. That was a good relationship. No, it was good. They were quite supportive. They could have done more but they were pretty supportive of our ... they backed us up quite well. In the initial stages when we were coming up with the big idea they were like, yeah, we love that. Let's do that. Let's pitch it. And we went through with it and the client bought into it and obviously the client wouldn't buy into it if it wasn't backed up well. I don't know. I think they were just stunned. I think everyone was quite shocked because we were so far along and they suddenly started bringing up weird issues, like `Is this too big for our brand.` Like, what? They asked for the experience, so it was really bizarre and they could've said more in that meeting but I guess, coulda, woulda, shoulda. They were probably just very stunned and shocked and like what. When we came out of there we were quite like, what just happened? What just happened in there? It was good. Just like ... supportive They gave us good information. I think it was really good. There was a lot of supportive team spirit. There wasn't any this is my idea, this is yours. It was very us and we're going to make this happen. I would have given it a 10. I think it would have been amazing. I think the suits could have ... because I think they got kind of scared and blown away by the scale of this whole thing but it was pretty much in budget. We'd spoken to people who were like how difficult is to pull this off? And production was like, no, no, it's doable. Obviously, we'll cut back on a couple of these things but we're on the right track. I don't think the guys backed it up enough. They didn't ... I think they should have said, `Look, we've taken your budget into consideration. We've come up with all of these ideas to fit in with your budget. We've checked it out. It should be fine. And then here's the idea. They didn't and I think they kind of got scared off big time. They were like, `Holy shit you want a whole town. It's gonna look like this. Like whoa. Like this is too much. It's crazy.` But it wasn't. I think we could have shown a big more, look it works with the budget kind of thing.  think the suits could have ... because I think they got kind of scared and blown away by the scale of this whole thing but it was pretty much in budget. We'd spoken to people who were like how difficult is to pull this off? And production was like, no, no, it's doable. Obviously, we'll cut back on a couple of these things but we're on the right track. I don't think the guys backed it up enough. They didn't ...

Cuz you made me turn it down and then in the meeting they were like Heineken threw a party last week for $2 million. Why can't we do something for $2 million instead of ... I think the budget was $7 or something. We were like, but um, you know don't you throw parties all the time? This is supposed to be the huge experience. This isn't just a party, because nobody's talking about the Heineken party that happened a week ago. Nobody, because this happens all the time. We were pretty much completely destroyed and heartbroken. Which, was probably why it collapsed, because there were just hundreds of different views and they all sort of took a strange negative tone and then snowballed and then it turned out to be completely disastrous when it didn't need to be.  So like, she's heard about that and she thought it was really cool and she thought it was like, `Yeah, that's really original. No ones doing that sort of stuff. That's out there and we want to be sort of in that realm.` I don't think the budget was there. Especially because they were pushing for the biggest idea. It felt like in the meetings they were saying things like `Let's get a huge DJ, fly people over to the Antarctica and have a party on an iceberg.` We were like ... They kind of ... when they were coming up with the brief they should have realized if they want something huge that no one's ever going to forget. It's probably not enough. I think it was right in the beginning when they were coming up with the brief they should have realized and put more into it or brought down the brief a little bit.  think it was exciting because it wasn't just ads and layouts and whatever. It was more like. It was like coming up with a whole experience and I'm quite into interior design and industrial design and things so it was very exciting to come up with what the place is going to look like. I had so much fun planning it. It just seemed like we weren't getting through to them because ... It was really frustrating because we felt like we totally onto their brief but they won't see it like. I wasn't allowed to talk in the meeting and I was just so frustrated because I could have totally answered their questions and then like you said you want this and we'll put it here but then I kept getting shushed in the meeting.

There's no Smirnoff and we were like, ahhh. It was horrible. Our marketing guys they didn't really stick up for us. They could have saved it too. Also, Neil's got this kind of rockstar approach to their side of it where he's like the client will say to xxx in their meeting yeah the venues been canned and then he won't tell us. He'll just be like. Ahh, screw them. We'll do whatever but it's important because we've got to know this to move on and he sort of we'll find out two days before the meeting when he knew it two weeks ago and we're like, dude. We kind of need to know.   They asked for the experience, so it was really bizarre and they could've said more in that meeting but I guess, coulda, woulda, shoulda. They were probably just very stunned and shocked and like what. When we came out of there we were quite like, what just happened? What just happened in there? I don't know.

They were like, `Holy shit you want a whole town. It's gonna look like this. Like whoa. Like this is too much. It's crazy.` But it wasn't. I think we could have shown a big more, look it works with the budget kind of thing.
