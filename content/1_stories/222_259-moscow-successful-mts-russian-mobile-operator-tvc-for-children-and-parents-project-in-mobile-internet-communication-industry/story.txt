Text: Mm-hmm (affirmative). Two weeks from first briefing to you on air. We need ... We had to create a TV commercial. It was TV commercial for children and their parents about special offer. For parents, they had IT in this offer that any parent could know everything about calls his child done. This project was created near September so we done TV commercial about ... in typical school manner. We used very touching music. Music which are known for any people in Russian. We have several small histories in this script. Histories about the children who ... I'll try maybe to make some pictures. They, don't know, but MTS has the brand shape like e. And we created the children shoot collected into the shape. For example, small boy playing with leaves with beautiful red or yellow leaves. And he put it up and they are shaped into a brand shape. Or maybe there was a story about one class who stands for photoshooting and they stand in their brand shape. So it was a rather simple, plain but it was very touching because we offered very beautiful music and it was very hard to conduct casting because it was summer. And in the summer, there are no children in Moscow at all. Actually, it was about three or four. It's actually too hard within this because it's a Russian company and they have a lot of levels and they have a lot of managers. And their manager almost often doesn't know which project is on the other levels. Actually, I think it's a problem in Russia because a lot of clients tell us about ... they would like to see something new, something fresh, but then we created it, they afraid of fresh ideas because they say, `We need fresh ideas. We should only show our product and show the price maybe.` And people would buy it. In Russian actually ... has beautiful phrase. I don't know how to say it in English. In Russian, it sounds, `People [inaudible 00:21:08].` Which means-  And now it's a real situation in advertising area and between our clients so it's too little clients who can decide or to do something fresh because they really afraid of ... and of course, we communicate with low level management. And they're afraid of decisions about any actually fresh or new because they also should ... they are responsible for sales. And it's more suitable for them. We had creative director, but formal creative director who took part only in one, maybe two meetings. There was a previous creative director, Vadim. I mean not Ivan because Ivan is still creative, but lower level. So he was nice actually because he was very busy and the most ... his functions wasn't mine. Account. Oh, it was beautiful relationship because there was a very nice girl, very responsible and very caught to the project. I mean very interested in the project. Actually, in this project, it was absolutely my own project because I have no art director on this project. It was absolutely... I have done it almost alone because no other director, almost no creative director. It was too hard but I'm glad that I had the job. That's all. Yes, yes, yes. And I know that the group which now is working with this client, they have a lot of problems because they produced manager, I mean, top level manager who before the day of on air the project, he could say, `I don't like. Create something new.` So it was a problem. Actually, I think it's a problem in Russia because a lot of clients tell us about ... they would like to see something new, something fresh, but then we created it, they afraid of fresh ideas because they say,   Everything. And now it's a real situation in advertising area and between our clients so it's too little clients who can decide or to do something fresh because they really afraid of ... and of course, we communicate with low level management. And they're afraid of decisions about any actually fresh or new because they also should ... they are responsible for sales. And it's more suitable for them.
