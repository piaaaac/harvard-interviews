Title: 21 NYC Unsuccessful DTC christmas website/print Project in Luxury industry

----

Text: It started off with, well first off for some reason there are two ECDs, executive creative directors, working on that account and then on the web site, because we have a web department where there are more CDs, and then us and the account people and there were too many cooks in the kitchen. So we had these ideas that it was horrible, because you would present it to one ECD who would approve it and then the other one would kill the idea, and then we would work on it and the account people would say that, and then the account people also had the same problem. They would like, couldn't get everyone in the room so they, some account people could kind of like approve something but then when we would show it to the other boss, he would kill the idea or what not. So it was chaos. So really, everything was great and then the producers saying we don't have time, then we sat in a room. One of the ECDs was saying something, the web people were saying other things, and we ended up killing the idea of shooting a woman because we don't have time, we don't have money, we don't have this or that. And then we end up being like click here and it says like when she says this it means this. And it's basically what it came down to. So I basically, I was so disappointed I kind of got asked to pull out of the project as I got put on something different. But I know if I had a passion for this I would have said to the new assignment like look, I can't, I'm working on this. But I was like yes. I want something new because this is not. Not that I wanted to run away from it but it was really annoying, so. No one had time to do research. Barely had time to approve it on time. No, I was just gonna say, obviously mention the whole line they have. The journey one, which is the stones go from the smallest to the biggest and the three stone ring that represents the past, present and future. They have their different lines that you have to mention. Budget wasn't that much, but within the, what we wanted to do was feasible within the budget. Definitely a huge problem. If we had time, we would have solved the internal issues. Because it wasn't even the client, it was internally we screwed ourselves up. o we had these ideas that it was horrible, because you would present it to one ECD who would approve it and then the other one would kill the idea, and then we would work on it and the account people would say that, and then the account people also had the same problem. there were too many cooks in the kitchen.

So I basically, I was so disappointed I kind of got asked to pull out of the project as I got put on something different. Because of their hierarchy within their department, they can't get everyone in the same room, so the same problem we were having here of, you need too many approvals to like have a final say of you're good to go. They would like, couldn't get everyone in the room so they, some account people could kind of like approve something but then when we would show it to the other boss, he would kill the idea or what not. So it was chaos.
