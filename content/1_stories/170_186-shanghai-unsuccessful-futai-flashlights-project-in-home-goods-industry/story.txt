Title: 186 SHANGHAI Unsuccessful Futai flashlights Project in Home goods industry

----

Text: Before is not too successful project, but I think it's not successful, it's not because, I think it's very complicated to say that one, because I think it's ideas process is very new for China. I think it's also important to let ideal to fit in this China market, because China's so different from the western country, and also the design environment here is so different. Also the client's perspective and what they can need, what they can't is also different. I think it's not the process that is the problem of itself, maybe it's just, it's not so fit in this market. Yeah, because you know the clients here are not so care about the research. What they want from a design consultancy is okay, I gave you money, you gave me the design. Look at the result, I get the feeling, I know that this is it, okay, this is it. If it's not, maybe, it's very hard to convince them. I think what we'll do is try to find a need or a big story, and what's the design come from from this story, now it's randomly an idea or just because it's beautiful. It's kind of hard to sometimes maybe getting some, maybe not, and it's depending on different project. It's also depending on different clients, what their needs from the project is also different. I think from the last project, which was a flashlight, it's very special because ... How can I say that? Because the company is actually not a big, big company which produce flashlight, so they don't really have a lot of money, which just means that they don't have so much money and time to get to explore very new product, but actually what they say, what they want is unique, unique flashlight, but it's very different. When we do HR phase to the daily, to the people, sometimes you ask one question, but maybe they answer it in another way. Maybe 10 minutes later, you have to ask a question again, but in the different ways, and try to get the core of their answers, because sometimes people say something, but they don't really mean that. I think this is [inaudible 00:09:54] for the client's part. Sometimes the clients say okay, I just want something cool, something beautiful, something that can sell a lot of money. It's [inaudible 00:10:03], you cannot get anything, right? I think it's very important for any project is to exactly get what is their perspective, what is they really want from this. I think if this works, the project maybe can work better. If not, because we can design something or do some work, but if it does not fit the client's need, it will not be successful. I think it's, maybe at first, I didn't want to teach the clients what we can feel, the design's just a product from this research. What is the core importance of research, because we know your clients, it means you know the market, then you can fit market, then you can get money from market. If you don't know that, it's minimized, right. Sometimes the client seems not interested in that part, just like last project, the clients fell asleep during the HR presentation. We even say 10 times, this is important. We never get it.  Sometimes the client seems not interested in that part, just like last project, the clients fell asleep during the HR presentation. I think this is what idea, we have to try to explore that idea. Also, this new project I have been through, I think it's better than before, the last one, because I think it's, we have [inaudible 00:11:55] here, which is one of the ideo founder, and he knows that it is very important to match our perspective with the client's one. During the end of the HR meeting, he is, because I kind of sound Chinese, and I think what we sign for the contract and what is the client's perspective not matched. I told him, and then he said even he didn't understand the language, he can get the feeling that it's not a match. End of the meeting, he tried to get his question clear, because he said if during this meeting, this problem is not solved, the rest of the work will be useless. No matter how beautiful a product you gave to the clients, they were never satisfied, because of the perspective. Yeah, I think it's why this project not really successful is what we gave to clients far away from what they can do and accept, because as I said, they don't have really a lot of money, but a really innovative product have to need time and money to let it go on market and tasks, but the clients, because they don't have that power, so they are afraid to try. They want the Ideo to make decision for them, but this is not what we do. I think this is big problem for them. Actually, Flash, because I didn't get involved into the HR phase and the flash project is to design a flashlight for American clients. I think it's very different, you know. Chinese people rarely use flashlight, but American people, maybe one people have eight or seven flashlight in their home. Actually, I think the behavior is different. For myself, I don't really have the experience of using or having so many different flashlights. Actually, none of our designer get involved into the HR phase, so we don't really can get the firsthand feeling from HR, and so from the thing that our colleagues tell us, there are some interesting needs, but I have used a lot of my time to see one of the flashlight [inaudible 00:22:07], different part of flashlight, and which sells a lot on the market, and also our clients like that flashlight a lot. That flashlight, actually, to be honest, at the first glance, I think it's super ugly. I don't know why people like to buy that. I know that it's a [inaudible 00:22:26] and they cannot take the light direction, it fit people's needs. When we know that clients are not satisfied with our work, I look carefully for selling one. I find that that flashlight already fits most of the need that we get for our research, so it means they're an already existing product, fits almost every need that we are doing now. I think it's ... that's really surprising, and I start to like it a little bit. For me, the flash design, I don't really think, for just myself, I think there are the perfect one are missing. I'm not really satisfied for myself for the design work, yes. I think it's, maybe at first, I didn't want to teach the clients what we can feel, the design's just a product from this research. What is the core importance of research, because we know your clients, it means you know the market, then you can fit market, then you can get money from market. efore is not too successful project, but I think it's not successful, it's not because, I think it's very complicated to say that one, because I think it's ideas process is very new for China. I think it's also important to let ideal to fit in this China market, because China's so different from the western country, and also the design environment here is so different The chop-chop, yeah. I also think the chop-chop company is better than the flash one, yeah, and they are willing to communicate with you. They are willing to hear your opinion, give their opinion to you, I think this is what idea, we have to try to explore that idea. Also, this new project I have been through, I think it's better than before, the last one, because I think it's, we have [inaudible 00:11:55] here, which is one of the idea founder, and he knows that it is very important to match our perspective with the client's one. the rest of the work will be useless.
