Yes, well I believe they are an ideal client and they take a lot of risks too. Risking in the sense of - There was a low budget. Two weeks, very little time. But in general we function with very little timing. We were four in that team. Leo was the creative director, and I worked with Sergio Rosetti we were in the same team of two, there was a copywriter and we were friends we got together on the weekends. I mean I am still friends with Leo and we were friends. We have a close friendship. I mean for me going to work, it still does not mean coming to work for me it means doing something that I love. No, they were very good. What happens is that in this project in particular, I mean it was a piece that worked and that was well-liked and that looked good, there wasn’t any problem, on the other hand, everybody was like happy and like happy with - I mean there couldn’t be a problem.
