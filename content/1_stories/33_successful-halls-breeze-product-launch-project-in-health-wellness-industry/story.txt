Text: Sorry, for Halls? I don't know, because that guy he suddenly he was not afraid at all, maybe the idea was not too risky. It is not risky, I would not call it quite well ... It was just simple and bright, and nobody was afraid of that. Well we have very good relations with the creative director, with Ivan [inaudible 00:20:14]. Not only with that project, but with any project we have together. It's not close relationships, but good, official relationships. Yes, it's very important and I started feeling that importance when I came here. I used to work in a small local agency with only about 40 people staff. The relationships were quite close, we were as family there. It was a bit difficult to tune yourself to global agency, where people are not so close. Where people only work together, they don't spend time after work. We used to spend some time with the previous agency, with the people from the previous agency, we were really close. We really understood each other from [Russian 00:21:48], as we say in Russian. When you come to a global agency where people just send tasks and describe what you should do. It's a little bit difficult from the beginning, but then it's okay. With me, with the client, with anything. The processes are not really professionally built, even now. Though they start being changed and being improved, and I appreciate that. Maybe it was just an exception and the client was quite relaxed, and understanding. They trusted Ivan, all our clients trusted him, he's [inaudible 00:24:54] winner, and anything ... He's quite an experienced person, and everybody knows that. So actually so many things are about this person. Planning was okay, the client ... You know, the whole project was okay from the very beginning. But I don't think that it's due to this or that department, this or that person. I don't know why the project goes so well. Maybe it was just an exception and the client was quite relaxed, and understanding. They trusted Ivan, all our clients trusted him, he's [inaudible 00:24:54] winner, and anything ... He's quite an experienced person, and everybody knows that. So actually so many things are about this person. In two words, in two words. I would rather say that I don't like the way the planning department work and the account department works in our agency I think that advertising as an industry is quite a young industry in Russia. So many people come here being not very good professionals. You may see so many young girls in account department. They don't know how to work, they don't know how to speak with people, they are not good psychologists. They're good at nothing, but it's not their fault actually. It's just the objective reality of the industry that we don't have people. There's a big lack of professionals in the industry, and that's why we hire somebody, and we start learning them. Making them learn things, like teaching them of course. So many people grow un-taught. They don't become better. Yes, you see a young girl working as an account manager with you in the agency, another young girl working on the client side. They communicate with each other. So they're like postmen, they don't do anything, they just deliver tasks and documents. But still, they may have some ambitions, like what do I have? Is it a nice text? I don't like it. Why should you like it? I don't write it for you. But she may still be an obstacle there. So that's what I call bad processes. You know, when talking about the planners, my personal experience is quite different. In the previous agency I had a very good planner, very good strategic planner. Actually he's the best within the industry I know. All the people that we have here are far away from him. They are not good. The process, yeah, I think that the processes within an agency, actually with a Russian affiliate, the processes are not yet tuned well. Actually until some moment in the past they were completely untuned. It was a mess. Now they are much better actually, because we have other persons, just another understanding of the problem and things start being more or less attuned, constructed, and it's much better than a year ago, I think. But the project I mentioned was a year ago, and it was maybe partially it was because the client is okay with us, and the persons that worked at that time there were adequate. We just had only one presentation of the ideas. We just came up with them and they selected the ideas just from the very first presentation. It's an exceptional thing, well at least with me, with my career. They say, that's okay, we like it. We actually shot one of the ideas was shot afterwards. Actually there was one decision-maker, one general decision-maker. At that presentation we had only three persons from the client side, and it was evident that only one of them makes the final decision, and he made the decision right during the presentation. He said, "Okay, I like this idea, and this idea too. Let's make the shortlist." The process, yeah, I think that the processes within an agency, actually with a Russian affiliate, the processes are not yet tuned well. Actually until some moment in the past they were completely untuned. It was a mess. It's difficult to say, because every time we meet with every client, with every task, there may be quite different number of decision-makers. Even the quantity of managers is different from time to time. Now we only have one manager, then somebody else may come up, then again, and the ... The more people you have at the meeting, even within some internal meetings, the more difficult it is to satisfy them. I think they're not tolerant, they're afraid of risks. I can understand it, because the managers they depend on the money that they will get in the end of the year. Or they are afraid of ... It's their maybe task to be afraid of something, I don't know, but sometimes they seem to be too scary. Quite a definite thing. You know, I like Jim Carey as an actor, and as a comedian, I like his movies. One of the films actually give me a hint, it was Truman Show. There is an episode in the film where he sits on the bank, or actually on the shore, and he starts crying and the rain starts falling right on him as a pillar, whoosh. He had rain only around him. Yes, it's very important and I started feeling that importance when I came here. I used to work in a small local agency with only about 40 people staff. The relationships were quite close, we were as family there. It was a bit difficult to tune yourself to global agency, where people are not so close. Where people only work together, they don't spend time after work. We used to spend some time with the previous agency, with the people from the previous agency, we were really close I would call them ... I can't find the nice word to describe them. I would rather not describe them. I don't like the relationships with almost any account manager in this agency. But that is probably my problem, not the problem of the agency. I don't know. I know how it could be better for me, if somebody doesn't like the way I work, for example. I know how to scare me, for example. If I know that I may lose the job, and I'm very afraid of that. I'm not a Muscovite, I came here from the regions. Which is quite important for Russia, because I cannot find work of the kind in my home city. It is almost only within Moscow that you can find nice job of a copywriter, well-paid. So if I know that I may lose it, I'm going to tear my ass apart. I don't know if it works with other people, with me it does work. They're good at nothing, but it's not their fault actually. It's just the objective reality of the industry that we don't have people. There's a big lack of professionals in the industry, and that's why we hire somebody, and we start learning them. Making them learn things, like teaching them of course. So many people grow un-taught. They don't become better. PROJECT ID  They are not convincing, they are not smart enough. They don't have sometimes appropriate education. So I see that they are not good, they're not relevant.
