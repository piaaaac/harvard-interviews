Title: Successful Tiger beer Project in Alcohol industry

Text: Well, the lead client on it was Singaporean, so he felt that because he was actually Asian that he knew a lot more about Asia than we did and he was very pedantic and he was like every little decision- I guess one of the reasons why this particular one is one of the favorite examples of something that went really well, is every single thing that we did here that concerned with and brought up, but we pushed back on every single one of the things that he brought up and we won more than we lost and we ended up with something that was hugely successful and everybody was happy with. but we pushed back on every single one of the things that he brought up and we won more than we lost and we ended up with something that was hugely successful and everybody was happy with. It was probably one of the most difficult processes to manage and get through but the result of that was what made it to mull it back and go, “Yeah, that was great”. I think we were able to manage him in a way that he listened. He was already receptive to a creative idea from the beginning, so that puts you in a good place where at least he was doing an ad that he wanted to be doing so it wasn't like we were pushing on that. In that particular office that we worked in, everybody really was career focused and reverse focused on trying to do the best work possible. I think that's very similar to what we've brought here as well but so, it was the team spirit in terms of wanting to do the best work we possibly could. That particular group of people are a tight-knit group, like we're all still really good friends, so that carries through the- I'm talking about Cam and Tom. They sort of backed off and let us manage it and they were on the same team, I mean they had the same goal that we did and it was clearly a priority of the agency to get the work through and to defend it. So, they did come on board and helped out a lot. But with that particular project, when it came in, it came in as actually point of sale posters and then store displays and the client wasn't really sure what they wanted, so we walked away with a brief and my creative partner and I at the time worked on it and working on the projects we had other ideas that we thought would work in viral space, and what ended up happening was instead of making poster or press ads, we ended up making half a million dollar TV spot that went on and started on as a viral campaign because there wasn't media behind it, and then it went all the way through Tiger Beer, through that network and ended up running in New Zealand, Australia, North America and the UK. So, this little project that was sort of, you know, nobody was really looking at, turned into something much bigger. And that just shows that ideas don't have to come off briefs and if an idea is great enough it can have a life of its own. Just the beginning of a brief doesn't mean that the limited put in place are necessarily an absolute. I think just looking at Asian culture and trying to find a way that was relevant to West- like trying to take something that was inherently Asian that Westerners would be able to identify with and tapping into that. I mean they had the same goal that we did and it was clearly a priority of the agency to get the work through and to defend it. So, they did come on board and helped out a lot. They were really good about once the idea had gotten through about, you know, pulling back and letting the creatives sort of take over. And instead of bringing issues, they sort of came with solutions, which is sort of getting back to what I was talking about in terms of a good environment to work where it's not obstacles, it sort of ways around obstacles, I think that's important for a success of an agency. think just looking at Asian culture and trying to find a way that was relevant to West- like trying to take something that was inherently Asian that Westerners would be able to identify with and tapping into that. The whole idea ended up revolving around reincarnation, so that was something that as a Westerner, I think most Westerners have an idea about reincarnation being a big part of Buddhism and Hinduism and all that kind of stuff. So, that helped to drive the creative idea. Well, the lead client on it was Singaporean, so he felt that because he was actually Asian that he knew a lot more about Asia than we did and he was very pedantic and he was like every little decision- every single thing that we did here that concerned with and brought up, but we pushed back on every single one of the things that he brought up and we won more than we lost and we ended up with something that was hugely successful and everybody was happy with. But he always wanted to offer the really authentic Asian point of view, which is great but we're also talking to a really broad audience. Didn't always matter if there weren't the right amount of people in a Chinese restaurant.
