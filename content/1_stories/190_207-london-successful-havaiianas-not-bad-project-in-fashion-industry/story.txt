Title: 207 LONDON Successful Havaiianas [not bad] Project in Fashion industry

----

Text: Like, I only will be on one or two projects throughout. They find my resources really good to impact and make impacts in projects around. Instead of just being continuous in one, which is fine. I don't mind doing. But, in IDEO we have this thing about flexibility, content, and leadership. Three things you should have or something. Those three. So I'm still learning this all. And so my content is a product designer. That's your main, core aspect of yourself. But, have you heard about the T designer in IDEO, did they talk about that? It was a Chinese twenty-seven, twenty-six year old guy, it was his first project management, it was his first, first project lead, and we all got to do our own jobs to be able to make the target. The team on that was three really young guys, but say twenty-six and twenty-three. We just followed who we were, and there wasn't really a sense of hierarchy, there was no one, even the project leader wasn't the oldest guy. It was a Chinese twenty-seven, twenty-six year old guy, it was his first project management, it was his first, first project lead, and we all got to do our own jobs to be able to make the target. So there was no one ever saying, do this, do this. Sometimes you need that in a really big projects, to get these things to the level, you have to meet these targets. But what we did, we only took our own world, you know? And did what we needed to do. There was no hierarchy, it was just interesting. I've never worked like that before. And at times I kind of needed someone to say, can you do this, do that for me. But, because I'm doing it, but it also in a way let me think and do my own things, and so it was cool. We came out with successful projects issued. No, we came out with good ideas, really good ideas without...we put it up on day one, which is a really big thing in IDEO. If it doesn't fit the user's foot, you know, it doesn't matter how well you can draw something or cast something up, or look great on a computer screen. If it doesn't fit the person's fit, comes to be doesn't stay on the person's foot, then there's no point, no one's gonna wanna buy it. The reason I say successful is that we got feet. We got people's feet and built around it. And it was a really different way of doing it. That's why I say successful. They were pretty risky. They wanted us to push out. They didn't want us to see... you kinda look at it like, we were designing a flip flop, you know? It's not gonna, it's a flip flop. You can't put batteries in it and make it fly. It's still gonna be impractical. I mean, those design principles are of simplicity, copy high-tech, you know? We couldn't go stupid about it, we couldn't make it out of gold or anything. Yeah, time was good, time was fine. It was pretty hectic, but you know, you're working maybe one or twice a week until eight, but normally finish at six, six thirty. It was not a stressful project in that time scope. Budget, there was never really a budget, it was a bit clad. No, they knew they needed help and they came to us. So they really, I think they knew [inaudible 00:29:59]. It's all coming out. And the project leader got us the job. Yeah, she's great. We get along really well. WE both have the same sort of industrial design background. At the time, as I said, I wasn't full time, so I was off trying to get a job. I was very keen, and eager, and immature, and everything that a graduate is. And it paid off, and we built friendship, and bonded, and she probably got us our jobs in IDEO. That's really, out different. [inaudible 00:30:54] Projects being full-time. It's really listening to projects leaders, more than anything, and having communication with it. I can't stress the communication is great. Just always talking to each other, never just sit there and think, fuck, fuck, fuck. You know, fuck! You can't do that, just say, just be honest and say, I can't do this. That comes actually to me because, I don't know, but I think a lot of people would struggle to ask for help. It's as if it's a weakness. I don't think it's a weakness, and it can't be a weakness at IDEO, cause it's such a multi-disciplinary place. As much as people say things about that, we're multi-disciplinary and stuff, yeah. Just brings to mind, whoever. For me, that doesn't mean much to me, but the point is that we can all talk to each other, and that's where I find the most inspiring part of it. It's not that we're all different, but if you can't all talk to each other, then there's no point. I mean, I'm really good at something, and he's really good at something. And if we can't bump and talk, there's no point. And that's where the team comes back in, you gotta be able to talk to each other. Yeah, it was cool. It was cool cause, as I said, it was almost five product designers. Two of which, myself included, weren't full time. So we were like, little puppies, trying to work, work, work. And then there was two, middle age, and one senior, and then our design director as well. Yeah, we all got a long really well. It was a good balance throughout the team, you know? There's always someone to look up to. They couldn't really ask me questions, one was a design director. But I think she really needed to in that project. Cause she could have gone higher, the creative director, but, you know I had, the middle of the guys to talk to, and I could do the work also, get the senior also, get the design director, so it was all about communication for all of us, and we all got a long really well. We're all very different people, so. There was a Welshman, Englishman, Spaniard, Japanese, Canadian. It was cool. It's really listening to projects leaders, more than anything, and having communication with it. I can't stress the communication is great. o we were like, little puppies, trying to work, work, work. And then there was two, middle age, and one senior, and then our design director as well. Yeah, we all got a long really well. so it was all about communication for all of us, and we all got a long really well. So, yeah, the idea of a stem, but you can also broaden out to these other stems. And that's one of my main stance as a designer, is that I can help in lots of other things. Which means I'm really good at the flexible side of it.  I know a good project I did well was the Ikea project. I think everyone in the IDEO team are decision makers. We'll all state our opinion, and build. We'd never bring, there might be a bit of negativity, about it's impossible to make or something like that, but- It's not gonna, it's a flip flop. You can't put batteries in it and make it fly. It's still gonna be impractical. I mean, those design principles are of simplicity, copy high-tech, you know? We couldn't go stupid about it, we couldn't make it out of gold or anything. But that was one of the first things we told them, we said, we believe from what your first designer fit, we can those, that brand of whatever that shouts, and make other arrange of flip flops that still talk about that. Still have the same values, but have different aspect, but still are Havaiianas, and not Birkenstocks, you know? Which is cool. I mean, we tend to over deliver a lot on an idea. It's kind of silly, cause we do a lot of work, but then it's all about making [inaudible 00:27:33] use them again, sort of thing. They just photographed it, and came back and presented it to us. I've never, I've always done projects where, the scale of it is I can see it. And this was one of the first projects where, I wasn't on the team to start, but then they came back and said, hey this is what we found. And it was just so inspiring, and then being there, but the stories they could tell was instantly, you know, my head was going ding-ding-ding-ding. Ideas. It was just great.
