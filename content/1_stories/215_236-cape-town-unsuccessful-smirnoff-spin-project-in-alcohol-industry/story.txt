Title: 236 CAPE TOWN Unsuccessful Smirnoff Spin  Project in Alcohol industry

Text: That's cute when they do that. Oh, I miss my niece. Anyway, how it started off, it was incredibly rushed. We had to, it was, again, it wasn't a super-creative thing, it was like, we had to come up with `quickly, something that is clearly fresh!` And it was really rushed, and didn't, it was very much an odd direction thing, we didn't ... you know, the line was really cracked, so it was just odd direction. And we had a big budget on it, something like ... I don't know, something like, 1.5 million or something for billboards, like a lot of money. And we, yeah, so the idea we came up with was very much, it was very much a crafting idea. You needed the best of ... it was very much a David LaChappelle style. So we sold the idea, and the style, our client loved it, and we explained to them this and this. We got the photographer, and said, `This is the photographer's work, this is perfect, she can do this.` But because we had a big budget, and a budget I could [inaudible 00:41:14], we were like, `Cool, we can actually fly her in.` 'Cause she's not here anymore. And the other guys that do fashion in Cape Town, that kind of fashion, the one guy's doesn't work so ... I see sort of like [inaudible 00:41:23], and the other guy, not so good at expressions. And this woman was British. She's perfect for the job. And we've worked with her before and she's, she was just perfect. So, but she didn't want to work in South Africa anymore really because of the fact that budgets, these kind of things always happen here. So we said, `No no no, we've got a big budget, everything's cool.` But now at this stage, [inaudible 00:41:45] was insane. We had to shoot already very soon. So we explained her idea, and she was super excited about it, she wanted to work with Conn again, and we didn't have final sign-off, but our timings were so tight that we had to start getting the ball rolling. So then, we spoke to Herbert, like, `this is what we're thinking...` and then she started putting in input, which she probably shouldn't have done, put input already. She started putting in input. Now ... and she was right for the job and everything. She was getting incredibly excited. She was seeing her staff and editor. Then, just before she was gonna ... we had to do this very quickly. She had to fly down, everything had to happen very quickly. So ... and she got a team together of people that she was thinking she'd work with. So we got some of ... in fact, nice people, 'cause with this kind of thing, this kind of execution is very much on the, based on the execution. It has to be done like, really diesel/David LaChapelle. Very styled, very, you can't just get a normal stylist, you need like ... so then she started giving input, and then just before she had to fly, like ... oh, it was such a mess ... the budget got cut in half. Now she's from London. She's already had input. What we should have done probably in the project is, we should have then counted our losses and said to her `We can't use you anymore, our budget's cut.` Yeah, that's what we should have done. But the thing is, it was very uncomfortable because the ideas she gave and the ideas we bounced together, was what we would then use, and you know, it would feel very bad using it and going ahead with it if she gave some input, you know? So that was very terrible. Yeah, so then she ... we told her this is the scenario, it's been cut, you know, `What can you ...` and she was like, `Well, okay,` she still wants to do it, but it's, she can only do it for so much. So then our traffic lady at this time wasn't really such a good art buyer. She wasn't really ... art buying wasn't really a thing. It was more traffic. So she estimated the cost for us for the models and everything. And she estimated, I mean, we did a green cross shoot a while ago, and she estimated according to the cost for the models for that. No, we didn't, I didn't do cost, so it wasn't our fault. I didn't know, like, she had costed for that. So the cost got approved and everything. She put down like, very little for models, we needed about 20 model, or 10 to 20 models, and they needed to be the best. They needed to be ... that they were able to paint it on the type of models. They needed to look international. They needed to have long legs. They needed to be perfect bodies, 'cause it's in a swimming pool with a blow up, big spin bottle. And, ooh, just [inaudible 00:45:14]. r So then, also, but our models also got cut into, they have to be 25 and, they must look 25 and older. Now we can't get them, most of them were overseas at the time. But except for that, we can't afford nice models. And like, Jillian's coming down, we tried to do casting, none of the models are right. We haven't got money, the ones that are right are too expensive, we can't afford them. Then our stylist went ahead and got all the stuff and everything, and then there was some miscommunication with the money. JWT took long with the payments, they had to pay out of their own pocket for staff, which is very embarrassing again. Then they started phoning me because the art buyer doesn't, she doesn't know what to say to them, because the payments aren't going through. She can't say. So they start phoning me and asking me for the money, and I'm like ... it was terrible. And then the art buyer got me to ... she's like, `I mean, you definitely should just drop some catering stuff by.` I'm like `What?` She's like `Just drop it on by.` In the end, there was like, no proper catering done, like, it was, like, people from the agency was taking catering there, like, all these models were freezing 'cause the pool, I had spoken to the guy about the pool, I shouldn't be talking to people about pools. It's not my job. And they couldn't heat, they said the pool would be heated. The pool wasn't heated because I didn't use, didn't have enough money to use the proper heating thing. The models were miserable because it's cold water at a cold time. The photographer's pissed off, the stylist hasn't got her money, oh, it was a big, it was such, it was such an embarrassment. And they kept on phoning me, I had to fight with the agency afterwards and say, because then there was this big thing with the retouching, there wasn't enough money to do the retouching further. Quick, quick, quick, but in the end, that thing lay on someone's desk for how long? We could've actually ... the girl didn't have to work after hours, send the thing on whatever through. They would fight with me for saying `I'm here on a Sunday, the girl hasn't sent her stuff through.` There's no one to tell me, you know, I can't ... I have to make a call and say `Yes, you'll have to just send, you'll have to do it now. Because we can't off the deadline so that you're subject to it and pay you overtime or whatever.` It was, oh, it was very badly managed. And it was quite a, I almost flipped out, because it was so bad because like, next time, after that, when people say to me, `Will you please phone this person?` I'll be like, `No, I'm not going to, because it's not my job.` 'Cause it starts, oh, it was a big, big, big, it was so embarrassing because she's such a cool photographer to work with. I don't think she'll ever work with JWT again. And even the models, they were absolutely miserable. I mean, it was really bad. And after this whole thing was approved, they almost bombed it. Off it was shot. The legal guy ... everything was approved and everything. They came back and said `This is how you do the old codes.` They came back and said that the blow-up bottle ... there's one woman. The blow-up bottle was very big. It was like, three meters or five meters, so it's big. And all these people in the pool, it's clearly fresh, and [inaudible 00:48:14], it was very much executional. Slightly over the top, you know, the glistening, that very [inaudible 00:48:19]. And the one girl held it up like that. Thing's big. And it floats up at all the people around, and then they came back and said, `No, it looks like she's giving it a blowjob.` I mean, it's a big bottle. I think it's, well it's not the main client. It's like the legal, it's also part of Brandhaus, but I think they do the legal stuff, you know, is the top too low, all the [inaudible 00:49:50] code stuff. I think it's to do with, they have to submit to them, you know, they're like, everything must be right according to them. So they're not really for the ... I think so. I mean, I'm not sure exactly, all about that. I just, you needed to just hear the comment. Of the ... no. Because ... but another project that also went very bad was another thing, was also with art buying because we didn't have a proper art buyer. And it was, I worked with Michael Marshfeld, which was the one that, the J&B guy that was so cool to work with, photographer. And another project I worked with him was also terrible because budget was cut and then, I ended up looking for clothes, and I ended up looking for, because we had already made this promise. And it's very, that kind of thing is really, it's not cool. It's a lot of cuts. But next time I will learn by saying, `I'm not going to,` or ... Yeah. I mean, with Jillian, she knew the budget had been cut and all that stuff, but in the end it was an issue with us, because she was ... she actually wrote a mail and everything. She was so upset because she wasn't paid like a month afterward or like, very soon afterwards, she still didn't receive her money from JWT. Because there's so much legal, not legal, so much paperwork that has to be done, that, I mean this has happened before with JWT. I think it's quite, it's very bad actually because a few times now we've had people that'll, that don't want to work with us because, well I know about this one illustrator that does scamping for us, and he's just like, `No, you guys take too long to pay. You don't pay.` And I think they shouldn't have to phone, and she had the same thing. Like, it was, oh, and she's world-known. It was so embarrassing to ... we worked very well together. She understood that I was like, so hurtful, and I didn't know what to say to her, and I just kept on saying `I'm so sorry.` It's very bad when you're in the middle like that. But like, I got along with her very well. She was very cool and it was lovely shooting with her. Lovely shooting with him as well. But if you're, yeah, the organizing is very important. And not over-promising. t's very bad when you're in the middle like that. But like, I got along with her very well. She was very cool and it was lovely shooting with her. Lovely shooting with him as well. But if you're, yeah, the organizing is very important. And not over-promising. No, probably not, no, I don't think we ever promised, it was difficult to do the same thing on the budget. And that way we did because the budget was so cut that, that kind of thing, we had to do it again. Because timing is so tight, and billboard's already booked. It's like, you can't really end, you know, you should know. Even if it's in that way, the client must know, never do that. And client service, who was client service again? Was it the same girl? I think it was. It was the same girl. Shame. She was so overworked. Yeah. It was about four, five. And traffic girl, same traffic, same thing. Oh, that's it. And you know, you can see the difference between good, like, that's why I was so relieved with the starter party thing, because I was so relieved at just proper organizing. I was like `Oh, this is lovely.` And you know, and models, casting, wonderful! `Yes, let's go for those!` None of this nonsense of no one knowing what's going ... I won't let my head like that again. I will demand on ... Shame, they were lovely people. Very lovely. I can't blame them completely. It was very much the budget being cut and all this stuff, but ... Yeah. I did a lot of their work. Like, I ended up speaking to people about digital members that she must have found out and I ended up phoning, doing catering. I mean really. It was a lot of ... Anything I would have wanted to do different with that other project actually, is if I could have flown up and ... it's always, with casting, it's difficult to see a casting if you're not the agency, the people in person. And because I was in Cape Town, they're in Joburg, and we didn't have a lot of time, and the budget was halved, I couldn't be there and see the people in person, and that's very important. You have to see them in person, 'cause they change on their photo. Oh, everything. Everything. From a ... We shouldn't have gone with Jillian [inaudible 01:09:37], but she's thought of me. We should have cut it off and said `I'm sorry. I know you've put in, we'll probably use your ideas, but ...` Because that was, we all spoke together. None of us should have done that. None of us. But the thing is, if we hadn't done that, that's why this is such a catch-22, we would never finish timing in what has to be done in the time. We had to get the ball rolling. With the end client, we should have strictly, we should have stuck with what they gave us, I should have earned with that Division 7 thing. I should have proved a point by not working until I get my brief, 'cause that's how it works. I should have done that. With this thing, I should have ... all of us, we shouldn't have done anything until they had the file going, which if we had done what they had done it, we would never have finished. But then, that should be like that then. They should know that that's how it works. Then they would learn, you know? Then we still would make it happen. I think stick to the protocol. I think that's what I learned out of all these things. Don't bend backwards for them because, just ... it's important to bend backwards, but, you know, tough love, almost. That's how they have to learn. But that Division 7 thing, it would have been a disaster if I didn't work beforehand on the stuff. We had to, it was, again, it wasn't a super-creative thing, it was like, we had to come up with `quickly, something that is clearly fresh!` And it was really rushed, and didn't, it was very much an odd direction thing, so then she started giving input, and then just before she had to fly, like ... oh, it was such a mess ... the budget got cut in half. We can't use you anymore, our budget's cut.` Yeah, that's what we should have done. But the thing is, it was very uncomfortable because the ideas she gave and the ideas we bounced together, was what we would then use, and you know, it would feel very bad using it and going ahead with it if she gave some input, you know? We haven't got money,   `I'm here on a Sunday, the girl hasn't sent her stuff through.` There's no one to tell me, you know, I can't ... I have to make a call and say `Yes, you'll have to just send, you'll have to do it now. Because we can't off the deadline so that you're subject to it and pay you overtime or whatever.`  I worked with him was also terrible because budget was cut and then Yeah. I mean, with Jillian, she knew the budget had been cut and all that stuff, but in the end it was an issue with us, because she was .
