Title: Loneliness and isolation

----

Text: On an individual practical/physical level, stress and demands of shopping was exhausting for me as I took on the whole responsibility of food shopping for myself and my husband as I was extremely concerned about protecting, my husband's health as he had been very ill with pneumonia last year. I am aware although I look fit, my physical strength and stamina is limited with new hips due to arthritis and joint changes in my hands, I kept my spirits up pre Covid by swimming and meeting people. I found the loneliness and isolation was awful during lockdown and I was extremely low mentally at one point. I have no idea how people in high rise flats coped. I know I am so fortunate to have had the outdoor garden space here, even so mentally I did reach a scarily low point. I worried about what would happen if we had to self isolate and still do, so as I was able I stocked my food cupboard with easily prepared food to keep us going packet soups mainly and UHT milk. Crackers and cheese, eggs if we became ill. Toilet rolls!! Soap powder and I did manage to get paracetamol after about 2 months. My daughter worried about me going out to the shops and purchased food for us and brought it to our back door. It was heart breaking not being able to put my arms round my granddaughter who is an only child. Both of us were desperate to give each other a hug.
