Title: Successful Sheridan Sheets (Pacific Brands) Project in Travel/tourism industry

----

Text: Yeah sure, I always look at the outcome of a project and to judge it. For me, I don't care what I go through as long as the end result comes out good. So with Sheridan Sheets, they make bedding and stuff and we had just won the account on an idea that I had worked on with another art director that had moved on, so when it came down to do the ad, we've done one ad with them, TV and print and it went really really horribly and the outcome was horrible. So there was a lot of how is this gonna go sort of thing, and it was for their premiere line and they're just launching it, and it just went really really well. We took it a much different way than what they... the way they did the other ads, and it was very theatrical the way we set it up, and the first meeting with people and showing them the ideas, they knew the ideas because these are the ones we won the account with, but I went in with some revisions, because we've set a stage, we actually made it with a stage from a play or something like that. And all that was in there and stuff and they really bought into it, and from there on out there was a lot of niggly and they would just go for funny stupid little things, but in the end it all came out really well. What other things do you want besides that? Really really tense because we had such a bad... I say that because it went really smooth, but we went into it quite tense because the first job had gone really really poorly, went horrible.

Even in photo shoots, they're in their camp and we're in our camp and they were... and they did a lot of that and they saddled up to the photographer and if a photographer, they sit right in front of you so the photographer can't really liaisons with you about how you see the shot, it's sort of like him and the client talking about... It was a little bit frustrating at times but in the end we got the shot we were after and the tenseness made it's way through. Good, good. Yeah. Sometimes... I don't know what the other creators are saying, but you must know there's such a warm, and I never... I haven't been in advertising that long but the last position I had was with a different company and it was much easier and since I've moved here, I was in Nike in Hong Kong for a while, I started to see the real anxiety and then I moved here and it's just a real battle between... And all that was in there and stuff and they really bought into it, and from there on out there was a lot of niggly and they would just go for funny stupid little things, but in the end it all came out really well.
