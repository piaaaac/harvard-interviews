Title: We are highly anxious

----

Text: Edinburgh Community Food quickly adapted to the pandemic, becoming a core member of the Vulnerable Group Food Network, supplying up to 1200 weekly large boxes of fresh food, long-life items and nutrition info to households. Thanks to pre-existing supply chains we could source most items with relative ease. However, there were notable shortages and crippling limits imposed on certain items. We are highly anxious about how our communities will cope going forward, with a mooted world food shortage, a 'second wave' and the winter flu season. We've developed new and demonstrably effective ways of linking with our communities online and feedback has been humbling and inspiring.
