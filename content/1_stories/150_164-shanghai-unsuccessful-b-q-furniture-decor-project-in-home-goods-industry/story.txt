Text: Three years ago, they want me do a TV commercial for them, but after three years, we still work on this TV commercial, and never work out. The client's team, the people changed, and every people have their own opinions. Every time they change, the people's wants time, we need to do some new commercial for them. A lot of people. I don't know. Every meeting we see the stranger [crosstalk 00:21:13] face. The brief is ... they want to add everything in the brief. It's very complicated. I think the most important reason is they add too much things in it. I think their company has a very bad [crosstalk 00:22:56] economic situation. Maybe that's the inside problem, so they doesn't care about it, advertising.   Maybe that's not a bad thing, but sometimes you're used to the way you match with some people, and suddenly it changes, you have got the time to used to this one. It takes you a lot of time to do this such things Finally, they like some TV commercial, but someone said, `We didn't have the money,` or there's always some reason to refuse us. Yeah. They have no idea Cause we haven't have the chance to know them deeply, because they always change the people. Maybe that's not a bad thing, but sometimes you're used to the way you match with some people, and suddenly it changes, you have got the time to used to this one. It takes you a lot of time to do this such things.
