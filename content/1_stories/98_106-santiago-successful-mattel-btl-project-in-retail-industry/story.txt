Title: 106 SANTIAGO Successful Mattel (BTL) Project in Retail industry

----

Text: It was a very rich experience and we had a very small budget. It was just placement and the website and that was it. The doll sales were dramatic, but what happened was that we sold the doll until we did this with the doll but all the products like castles and such things didn’t cause – well, those are a lot harder to sell. But that is something of which I am very happy. It was tiny project. They were very – I mean I didn’t expect – we had knowledge that it could work because Internet here is very – what happens is that promotion was basically online. It wasn’t through text messages. It was harder for children to reach, so in terms of the mechanics they took risks. They could’ve not gone online and nobody – now the mechanics of the communication is very well tested because we always make the same mechanic and it’s the effective one for kids, but the it was pretty hard and they were taking a risk. They said, this is going to work but it took us six months to do it. They were very confused at first with the how and this and that. Then they later wanted to take them to the zoo instead of the Bahamas Island and we had to convince them a lot and – I think we could have had a bigger budget for the prize. They trust us. They give us the freedom to manage the resources they give us, as we best think fit, while of course having these restrictions. They tell you that you cannot do anything online unless it is linked to another website, that the main communication focus are placements so we tried to do other kids of placements that were more strange. For example, like I tell you, one of the placements for this promotion was that two of the characters from the TV series were in the classroom and the teacher is teaching a geography class and she would say, “Well, there is an Island in the north called Bahamas Island which is surrounded by dolphins and nature.” And one of the kids would say, “Oh, maybe Barbie could be there. Yes I think that we could go look for her. Let’s look it up online and on the map.” So they were not traditional placements. They were fun to watch and they let us do that. They take risks. She’s an Argentinian, Paula. It was hard because they sort of – my partner was a man and this was clearly a very feminine project, so he was a little reluctant at first because it was Barbie and everything. So I would try to explain to him how dolls worked and little girls’ relationship to dolls, and he was like “They are all crazy, this can’t be.” But then he sort of found it interesting to create fun things, but at first – and we were both just starting so for anyone who is just starting it was like – Of course, now if I get a product that is very masculine I think I won’t know what to do.  It was okay, but it could’ve been a lot better because they didn’t press the client to tell him, “This is really necessary.” I think that is very important as well, not to press them to take a decision but to give them a small push. I think we were aligned, and the entire team focused on the same thing. We all knew what the idea was and we liked it and we wanted it to work. I think there were some coordination problems. The client took a long time to decide this and therefore everything had to be rushed in the end; it could’ve been a more easy-going project, even when at the beginning I told you that time was okay. It was okay, but it could’ve been a lot better because they didn’t press the client to tell him, “This is really necessary.” I think that is very important as well, not to press them to take a decision but to give them a small push. They supported us in understanding the target and in seeing how to solve the awareness issue. We were able to manage it appropriately. Time was also okay. In that project it was because we started working earlier; then when they took the decision it was kind of a rush because of an issue with dates, independence day and – but it went well. We did it and it wasn’t stressful. The story. We were inspired by the movie and in the role dolls have for little girls. They are the projection of themselves. They see themselves as princesses. They see themselves as a veterinarian, a doctor, they see themselves with the boyfriend and that’s why they’ve had to come up with movies and everything   They trust us. They give us the freedom to manage the resources they give us, as we best think fit, o I would try to explain to him how dolls worked and little girls’ relationship to dolls, and he was like “They are all crazy, this can’t be.” But then he sort of found it interesting to create fun things, but at first – and we were both just starting so for anyone who is just starting it was like – I think we were aligned, and the entire team focused on the same thing.

The profiles – because we were just – we weren’t just being introduced to the brand but to understand what type of promotion could work, what was the role of the doll, what’s the process girls go through, why are there groups of dols for certain type of girls? So they sort of explained more what the interaction the kids have with the toys.
