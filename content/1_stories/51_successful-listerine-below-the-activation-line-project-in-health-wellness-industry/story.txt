Title: Successful Listerine (Below the activation line) Project in Health/wellness industry

----

Text: I think a project that went really well was last year's Listerine below the line activation. Where I guess we started off with very much the team sort of working together to solve the problems. We would have everybody on the team thinking about it and working together to solve different areas of it. There were - it was probably - there was Doug who was our CD at the time. Roger, Jess, myself, Amy. I guess working together as a group and then solving different parts of it. Working together, adding different value along the way and coming down to an idea. Which I think Jess, Jess then carried on with and it was rocky as well. To working off clients, we had a client who was quite pedantic. Bit of a workaholic. Very much sort of too and fro with the client. We eventually got the thing solved through and then brought in external, online people who made a huge contribution to it. Sort of point of sale development companies. Yeah, ended up with something that worked off the global TV ad which would run in time. And worked pretty well in engaging people on radio and then at an event at the end. I guess it was - you know we saw the original idea and she bought it straight off and too and fro really was execution of that idea. Sort of getting her buying for the look and feel of it. Getting that approved and just working those components of it. Like the online thing, working with - they've got their own partners. Working with them toward that. The brief didn't change, no. Because the idea was very much the activator of the global platform. So it was quite solid in that way and that response was quite direct. I mean, sort of controlling of - I think that our strategy and our senior clientele people involved on and ongoing basis to ensure that we're working towards our goals. The moment you come up with a solution it will be sent to check with strategy and the business directors to ensure that, before it goes across the client. And I guess the client goes through there and internal presence. I think a certain amount of stuff comes out in the creative process. You know, if your brief is a bit thin then it's working, making sure it sort of ties in using the brand insights and the brand understanding. And the target market understanding to keep bringing it back. I think that gets - there's a certain amount of sort of free creative thinking and just putting things down no matter what they are to really style out their thinking. Once you've gone through the process of that, which I think helps. I think on Listerine, she was pretty happy. I think she's prepared to take a risk provided it is - it's not way out there. If it can't be substantiative of it's own brand. If it makes sense she is going to take the risk and put the money in to run the project. I think everybody - sort of everybody's contribution really. I don't think there's any sort of central inspiration. I think it's just really the culture of working together, which I think is quite unique to our team, really. We work together very much as a whole unit, as a team rather than sort of individual pockets. I think they're very - the client can be very - some possum calls - and can - it has been frustrating that on days, actually has entirely bought an idea and been happy. Then two days later, she's not happy with it. Whether that involves her in house process or what, I'm not sure. But it can be - you can be a bit unsure about how she's going to respond to things. I think it's probably to do with her consulting other people, you know? Or perhaps she - initial thoughts don't cover, she perhaps thinks about things in a different way and comes up with different issues where it concerns, I guess. They're all going "Yes. We'll send an email." (laughs) It's quite weird 'cause she is, you know. If she doesn't like some thing, she isn't scared to say she doesn't like it. It's not that she's innocent in the meeting thinking it's rubbish. I think it definitely is part of her process. I think good. The client service person is very much client orientated. She doesn't spend a lot of time with the team in solving the issues. That said, her client service director is more involved with the team. And the process and the team. It's a bit mixed. We've got a great relationship with planning. They're very involved. Very hands on and very responsive to our needs and our creative as well. They've always got something positive to put in and to direct our creative. Well, Doug. Doug is very hands - he was very hands on when he was here. Absolutely, you know. We need to be fully involved in any project that's going on. I think that's the culture that we work in. It's a very flat structure that the creative director is involved all the way through, and pushing and challenging Yeah, great. There's good communication. It was initially moved around quite a lot. It was worked up in different areas we worked on by different people. Different times. I think again, you know. Really good. Where I guess we started off with very much the team sort of working together to solve the problems. We would have everybody on the team thinking about it and working together to solve different areas of it. Even if an idea is not necessarily right on, I think that it's worth gathering that all in and then into that process you're resetting what is on brief and refining it there at the end of it. Perhaps responding to certain issues and problems and growing the process.  I think everybody - sort of everybody's contribution really. I don't think there's any sort of central inspiration. I think it's just really the culture of working together, which I think is quite unique to our team, really. We work together very much as a whole unit, as a team rather than sort of individual pockets I think they're very - the client can be very - some possum calls - and can - it has been frustrating that on days, actually has entirely bought an idea and been happy. Then two days later, she's not happy with it. Whether that involves her in house process or what, I'm not sure. But it can be - you can be a bit unsure about how she's going to respond to things I think there was certain production processes and the - there was a bit of a disjoint between what was done on the day of the shoot and what actually came out. I think, sort of managing the client's expectations and having her more involved in what was shot on the day would have helped. (laughs) I'm not sure. I mean, she signed off on the models and the look and feel. When it came out of re-touching on the other side, she wasn't happy and there was quite a bit of work. I think that there was - I'm not sure what. It was just a bit of a disjoint.
