Title: Contradiction that Covid’s brought out

----

Text: I think it's a shame because my sense was that there seems to be a bigger consumer push towards moving away from plastics recently, especially when it comes to food packaging and the consumer, the mentality in supermarkets seem to be paying more attention to that as well. But now with what's happened with COVID, the use of plastic, it's just shot up again. It just feels like it's not priority to people, they keep thinking about, "well, this is exceptional circumstances". But of course, the more that it just becomes greater plastic, greater packaging, cleanliness sort of concerns around that and everything is disposable - the masks and everything that's involved there. It's such a shame because it exists in this contradiction with people being more aware of nature as well and people reflecting upon “oh, gosh, there's been less cars. It's lovely to see that there's actually birds, who knew there were birds around” and this sort of thing. So, it's real shame to have that contradiction that Covid’s brought out quite a bit
