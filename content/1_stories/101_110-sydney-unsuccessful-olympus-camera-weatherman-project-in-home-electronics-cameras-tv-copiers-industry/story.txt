Title: 110 SYDNEY Unsuccessful Olympus camera (Weatherman) Project in Home electronics/cameras/TV/copiers industry

Text: Yeah, I think the spot was called, it was called Weatherman. Simplest idea ever, and it just sort of really lost its way through the whole creative processes, and it was one of those ones where it wasn't, the reason I am so disappointed in that one is because I feel like we could have actually made it better ourselves, I don't feel like anybody came in and screwed it up, it wasn't the client screwing it up or anything like that, we just sort of lost our way with the idea and it didn't come out as great as it should have been. It started as a really good script, and then the director came in, who's a great director, but we were a little bit more junior at the time, and so he comes in with all his points of view and we figure, well he's a director, we should listen to that. And then you also listen to your creative director, and we started listening to too many people, and not holding really tightly to the idea, and I think it just sort didn't end up what it should have been. I mean, they bought, again, they bought a really good script. We just screwed it up, that's what's so disappointing, is that, usually someone else screws it up if it's gone wrong, but that time, it felt like it was us. Trying to remember. Was actually a really simple, really good brief, really well written, but it was just one simple proposition was that the camera's Weatherproof, can withstand rain and all this sorts of things. Very strong, that they have, the sort of one, at that point in time, there was like one really difficult person over there who's the sort of product manager. He's the only person from the client side that I think hurt the ad as well. It was mostly us, but, as an agency, but what. He doesn't, they've been working on a lot over there, but he doesn't understand the idea part of the advertising, because he comes from a really technical product background, so he understands pixels, and you know, the body of the camera, the dust filters and all that sort of stuff, but he has no understanding of an idea, so you know, wanna throw this part in here and this part in here, and not understand what that does to the ad   Well, that was Andy and I, and I mean, the relationships were, our relationship's good, but I think amongst everyone else, it was imbalanced. Their relationships were imbalanced in terms of some really senior people, and us being a little bit more junior, and not throwing our weight around enough.

PROJECT ID Well, yeah, I mean, our creative director at the time, he was fantastic, but he was, you know, he's the most imposing personality and the director is also, you know, he's been directing for 20 years. So just the experience levels more than anything. We'd only been working for five years at that point, and they'd all been working 20.
