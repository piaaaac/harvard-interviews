Title: 8 LONDON Unsuccessful HSBC (golf)  Project in Financial industry

Text: Yeah, it didn't feel like they were really confident. To be honest, I haven't really worked load. We're working on the HSBC thing now, but we haven't ever worked on the B-TV ads or anything, but as far as I know they're not that adventurous. Well I don't think the budget was very much, but time constraints probably wasn't, well, I don't think it was too bad, as far as I can remember - it was a couple of years ago. Normally, time's not a great thing. But - yeah, I don't think it was particularly bad on that. Well, no, normally they don't give you enough, or they have a briefing around for ages, and they give it to you with only a few days to work on it. But also, too much time on that thing...a lot of teams might not have enough time, but you give someone like a month or something, you won't work on it properly for a couple of weeks, so you won't really think about it properly until...so you can have too much time as well. I'd say we got a lot of common interests. I think the way we think's different. We know each other, we like the same sort of style of things. But he'll always say something, or I'll say, that's interesting, I didn't think of that. So often I might overcomplicate, and Craig always sees it in this sort of simple...he'll talk his mind, and he'll say, well that's just shit, innit? Which is, you go, it is quite shit, yeah. Yeah you do, yeah. And I think we work well together, basically, we've worked together for ages. Yeah, totally. I think we were just sort of joined together in our unhappiness. It's just that it was a really nice idea which should have happened, and they end up going with an idea which wasn't as good, which is really annoying. Well yeah there was our creative directors, Greg and Mike. They really liked the original idea, and there was nothing they could do about it, it turned out to be what it was. I don't think they did. I think it was them just deciding themselves. It probably was they knew that last time they did a golf thing they used this kind of silhouette which we ended up using. I think it's because they knew that worked, they thought, well then why don't we just be safe a bit. To be honest, I haven't really worked load. We're working on the HSBC thing now, but we haven't ever worked on the B-TV ads or anything, but as far as I know they're not that adventurous. Yeah, because basically they'd done the most, the lamest things, they went back to the campaign from the last year. So, they year before. [inaudible 00:16:01] reverted back to the -- I mean they managed to change it gradually, gradually back, and then it was just like the one from the year before, nothing like what we chose, is it? They would say change one thing, and that one thing turns into something else, and they go, well the year before we actually made this, we want to change this other thing. And then [inaudible 00:16:45] classic things they do is change a brief. But I feel with this, they might have just said, actually why don't we just go with last year's work and you just write new lines for it? I'd say we got a lot of common interests. I think the way we think's different. We know each other, we like the same sort of style of things. But he'll always say something, or I'll say, that's interesting, I didn't think of that.   Yeah, it was fine. We didn't really get to talk to them much. I think they were fine with the people who worked on the account team, and our creative directors. But I don't think we get enough contact, you know, with the clients, which is a shame. Why would you trust someone if you never met them, you know? I think we should definitely have more contact. Yeah as far as I can remember. So I don't think I really blame them for the client being lame. Not having any conflict. I think a lot of the time they kind of really know in the back of their mind they're gonna go with that anyway, but at least they'll just give you the brief and see if you can come up with anything else. And they always know they can go back to that. It's a safety thing.
