----

Text: Some input we should from client. They know everything. They already did 10 years. This good we can get a lot of knowledge about firm. Yeah. They did. They want us some part make it ... Yeah, it's quite innovation. We get some inspiration for this [inaudible 00:23:29]. Yeah. I think this quite help for us. The style of design can be very wide, so let's do this, we can exactly get the client's want. Budget, yeah. But [crosstalk 00:24:43] you know, because in my previous company, that time we have a lot of project, but we don't have a lot of people, so sometime I need to work two or three project together. Yeah. Budget is okay. Because I'm super busy. Time is not ... it's short. Very short. But for Chinese, they design 10 concept, maybe just two or three is good. That's different, right? Because the western people, they before doing, they get a lot of thinking, but Chinese people is doing and thinking, so that's different. Let's go back to clients. I think clients also want, "Okay, we need a lot. We need to see a lot. We need this project super fast done." That's client's patient. Yeah But for Chinese, they design 10 concept, maybe just two or three is good. That's different, right? Because the western people, they before doing, they get a lot of thinking, but Chinese people is doing and thinking, so that's different. Let's go back to clients. I think clients also want, "Okay, we need a lot. We need to see a lot. We need this project super fast done." That's client's patient. Yeah. Yeah. I think if work very well, we should work very closely with our clients sometimes. Maybe foreign clients, and western clients maybe more prefer the phone call, telephone conference. Sometime maybe Chinese people more prefer face-to-face discussing. I think that's good. It's maybe one week one time work with clients, because let they know what we are going to do, going on. It's can very close the clients, we know more about the clients, what they are want. Also, what we want, we should influence the clients. I think that's a good way, so for did the project. Communication with clients maybe more tough, but Chinese clients is okay. Yeah. I think I just maybe work very closer. Also, the team member, because some designers, they have very special personality like maybe just work in night, so we can't see anything from him, just through him. This is a problem, maybe we go out, have lunch, sometimes just make very good relationship, so can get him. PROJECT ID Communication with clients maybe more tough, but Chinese clients is okay. Yeah. I think I just maybe work very closer. Also, the team member, because some designers, they have very special personality like maybe just work in night, so we can't see anything from him, just through him. This is a problem, maybe we go out, have lunch, sometimes just make very good relationship, so can get him. Try to use the product, find a good way for user. Yeah. I think for industrial design, the use is very important, less than style, less than looking. We just try to different way like prototype, prototype a lot of time to test what the best function is, best use is. Yeah. Actually, they did a lot of documents for us, like what's the background about this product, what's the consumer? What's the work environment? Is this work product work environment, or technical input. Okay. They also did [inaudible 00:23:14] like they [inaudible 00:23:17] for the car, like a truck. They said, "Okay, this style we want, because we need very [inaudible 00:23:24]." Yeah. Some design consultancy, they want to change them. They want make a project very ... for the whole process, and want to create some innovation I think, but we don't have time, we don't have budget. I think both the environment, because the industrial design just started in China maybe 10 years. In the first two years, the design consultancy just like a factory. They just very cheap, and maybe with a lot of sketch, a lot of idea give client. Client says, "Okay, industrial design is cheap, right?" I think good is we did brainstorm with the clients together, so clients told a lot of their expectation. What's the technology? What's the consumer? We are quite understand very well. Because you know ID, industrial design, because we are touch a lot of products, sometimes we can't maybe design of home, we don't know maybe this project just three months. We can't know everything about this firm. [inaudible 00:23:47]. Just find some picture like iPod style, or this kind, this style, they can told you, because they know design. Like watch or something, maybe watch is very strong, very man, yeah. I think Fluke, because they want to develop the Chinese market. They want to find design friend like design consultancy to help them, because Chinese design consultancy understands the Chinese market, Chinese people. They are just start looking for some good company, they choose my previous company, but it's very careful. Something they consider a lot of time, "Okay, so just give you one project for let me see."  I think maybe we should go back to think about Chinese people. From my perspective, I think Chinese people more like, "Okay, I just do this thing, done, and this can be fast, it has to be done." But some international people, like western people, they can go very deep. They can do a thing very deep. They can do one more research just for one pen, right? They can find different opportunity for design this pen. But Chinese people, when they get this project, "Okay, just do this. Just start design this [inaudible 00:26:38]." Maybe they can create 10 concepts, but western people, maybe just create three concepts, but these three concepts is quite good.
