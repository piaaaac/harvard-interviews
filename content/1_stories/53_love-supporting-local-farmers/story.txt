Title: Love supporting local farmers

----

Text: We live in Dingwall and my parents have a Croft, so we have our own eggs, venison & fish. We do try to be very good and shop local where we can instead of supermarkets. We make lots of jams with home grown fruits & my mum does loads of baking and cooking, always from scratch with ingredients bought locally or home grown. The veggies, we buy just now from The Spud Bus - love supporting local farmers and itâ€™s our small way of showing appreciation.
