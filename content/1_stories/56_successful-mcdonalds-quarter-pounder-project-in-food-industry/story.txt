Title: Successful McDonalds Quarter Pounder Project in Food industry

----

Text: In the office. I remember we were talking [inaudible 00:21:23] the creative director and it sort of [inaudible 00:21:26] creative director got involved and made it better as well to be honest at the time. No, we wrote, we, between, we wrote them up and the creative director, his input, he would help shape them as well. So he had a lot to do with it as well. And [inaudible 00:21:45] script was presented to client, it was all quite quick turnaround of ours, because it, we had such a looming deadline, it was a lot of pressure on that project. It was all quite ... No, we previously had been to the client with other ideas. Two, maybe, at the most. But this was like, even when I look back on it now, it was like a bolt out of nowhere, really. And it explains sort of, that situation isn't an ideal one to be in in terms of deadlines looming and then you've got to come up with something. But, it can, one of the things, the thing about creativity, it's how long is a piece of string, it can come to you when you haven't got deadlines, [inaudible 00:22:36] account. Easier when it comes to when you haven't got a deadline, though. When you have it's a bit of a struggle. On that project? We had a good relationship with them, actually. He was, to be honest with you, the whole thing came down to the fact that he was a good client, really. The relationship was good but it was a good relationship and we were quite closely within, I can even remember his name was [John Hawkes 00:23:16], I don't remember that many clients' names. Because he brought so much good work. Because he could see a good idea, really. He didn't, it wasn't a case where he brought a really good idea, there were good ideas he didn't buy as well. But ... Fine, yes. We don't really analyze the basis of our relationship that much, me and Mark. The relationship only comes into, you only feel like, if there's a time pressure, [inaudible 00:24:07] sort of, [inaudible 00:24:09] might be [inaudible 00:24:11] friction if you know what I mean. It can be. It's not ideal, it's just if you're on a deadline's looming or you're working on something you don't want to work on you can often get agitated by that as well, when you know a client's never going to buy a good idea. It's like, it's almost like, it's like not enjoying your work because you have the same symptoms of somebody who's in a job where they don't want to be there. That's what it's like working on a project where you don't [inaudible 00:24:40] work on it, do you know what I mean. There's nothing particularly special about it, put it that way. It was just, everyday thing, really. Just came up with a good idea and it got made and it got bought, it doesn't happen that often. [inaudible 00:25:13] it does is. If we could explain it we'd be doing it a lot more, presumably. Yes, the client is quite influential, the client. It depends what your definition of "what went well." I can tell you for me success, well, quite selfishly is when you win an award. But from the client, it's obviously making the product sell a lot great for their brand. But the thing is they've done these studies where 73, I think it's the Gunn Report, but they did 73% of award-winning advertising is also effective advertising. So the way we try to sell to clients is, the best work for your business is award-winning work because it's proven that it works, it sells. When we did it we didn't think it wasn't going to win loads of awards, we just, because it's such a hard brief, all we could think about is cracking this brief because everybody had a go at it, the deadline was looming, we were into real sort of pressure, so we made that with a good director, shot it and then [inaudible 00:16:47] it and stuff and people seemed to love it. And then it did really well, so. And then it was reshot in Canada, they reshot it for their market. Then the client re-ran it quite a lot of times because they loved it. So that was a successful one for us. Yes the brief was something vaguely to do with summer because it was a price promotion [inaudible 00:19:01] Quarter Pounder and it was vaguely to do with summer. And then we just, we had this idea and the client was good enough to realize that this idea was bigger than the brief. It was quite ... It was something to do with the summer and I can't remember [inaudible 00:19:16] about "Enjoy summer with a McDonald 99p Quarter Pounder" or a special offer. But it was one of the things, a Quarter Pounder with cheese is a quarter pounder with cheese, there's not much else you can say with it, so, we come up with this really simple and entertaining way of selling it. Then luckily the client was clever enough to realize it was a great idea. Easier when it comes to when you haven't got a deadline, though. When you have it's a bit of a struggle. t's just if you're on a deadline's looming or you're working on something you don't want to work on you can often get agitated by that as well, It's like, it's almost like, it's like not enjoying your work because you have the same symptoms of somebody who's in a job where they don't want to be there. It's like, it's almost like, it's like not enjoying your work because you have the same symptoms of somebody who's in a job where they don't want to be there. That's what it's like working on a project where you don't [inaudible 00:24:40] work on it, do you know what I mean. And ours was just, this is the amount of work a plumber has to do to be able to afford the McDonald's 99p burger, I think because in the summer it's particularly hot, you don't tend to go for a big burger And then we stumbled across this idea which is basically, it was a price idea, because they usually do price, talk about price and then attach it to a theme or whatever. one thing about McDonald's then is they didn't use research.  And then we just, we had this idea and the client was good enough to realize that this idea was bigger than the brief. It was quite ... It was something to do with the summer and I can't remember [inaudible 00:19:16] about "Enjoy summer with a McDonald 99p Quarter Pounder" or a special offer. But it was one of the things, a Quarter Pounder with cheese is a quarter pounder with cheese, there's not much else you can say with it, so, we come up with this really simple and entertaining way of selling it. Then luckily the client was clever enough to realize it was a great idea. No, we wrote, we, between, we wrote them up and the creative director, his input, he would help shape them as well. So he had a lot to do with it as well.
