Title: Successful Jetblue Simpsons Sponsorship (blog) Project in Transportation industry

----

Text: Okay, so as part of the sponsorship to get the word out and how Simpsons have taken over JetBlue, I wrote from the perspective of Mr. Burns. I took over his blog, the JetBlue CEO, from the perspective of Mr. Burns, and Mr. Burns trashed David Neeleman, basically telling him all the things he could have done wrong. And of course, by trashing him, is actually giving him a compliment, because he's saying David Neeleman is too humane in a nutshell, and treats passengers too well. Whereas as a CEO needs to destroy them. So that worked out well, because it was a voice I know well, and I was able to emulate. I think it was pretty cool. It got good coverage on different advertising blogs, even TMZ. So that was somewhat of a success. There was no budget, because there was no need for a budget. It was all on JetBlue-owned website. So it was free media. Time constraints were ... Maybe I had a month to do this. The initial rounds, no. But then, of course, when there's comments and you need them less than a day later, then it becomes tight. I mean, it was a small project, a very small project, but all the ingredients were right to make it really enjoyable.  More or less just willing to work ... Not really dictating to me, willing to work with me, just kind of ... I guess it was a very odd situation, just because just being a fan, we had more Simpsons knowledge than anyone else who's kind of defaulted to our judgment. In more cases than we would in any other situation. There were several ... It was kind of two levels once there were several ideas presented for the JetBlue sponsorship of the Simpsons movie. And what was presented was probably about 25. It got narrowed down to a few, very diluted, and this was one of the only last remaining living ones. Then once on this project, I had to write probably 20 or so different entries, which got narrowed down to about four. Four specific, I guess, executions of this idea. I took over his blog, the JetBlue CEO, from the perspective of Mr. Burns, and Mr. Burns trashed David Neeleman, basically telling him all the things he could have done wrong.
