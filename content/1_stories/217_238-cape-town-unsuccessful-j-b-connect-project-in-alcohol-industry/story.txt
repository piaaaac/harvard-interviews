Title: 238 CAPE TOWN Unsuccessful J&B Connect Project in Alcohol industry

----

Text: The brief was sent out. It came to us. What the fuck was the [pov 00:22:21] line? Connect. Get connected. Connect. Something like that. It was about connecting with Bern, connecting with people, connecting to other and J&B's got an integral role in connecting people. We were meant to do a TV ad for ... one TV ad and we went back and forth probably presented about 14 scripts. We'd gotten 20 but when you use 14 of those scripts and we went back and forth back and forth and client didn't know what they wanted to say ... and, yeah, strategically all over as well. They didn't really know what they were doing and the personality of the brand. The brand had gone through quite a rough patch. Probably five or six years of quite a bad patch and they were all over the show. There was no single line of thought. Just them saying different things. So that was all over. They didn't know their brand either. And we ended up with one ad that was great that we did present. We even went to brief directors. So it was quite close. We were on track. I think they researched. They put into research with some other global work done by an agency in Germany and their work was quite ... what would the right word be? It was just easy work. It was flat. It wouldn't ... it's nice. It's fine. It wouldn't do anything crazy and they eventually went with that after about a years worth of work on one TV script. So that was quite ... that pissed us off quite a bit. You know it works [inaudible 00:24:31] which is very boring. It's just fine. You know we would have done something really different, especially for the whiskey ... in the whiskey category. Would have been one of those ads that would have stood up and noticed. It ended up being something that was quite user friendly for all countries as well. A person in India, it'd be fine. I person in South America, it'd be fine and we understand. You know? Yeah all the working, successful brands piss somebody off. You know? They definitely stick out. They do something interesting and I think those clients, which are still are clients [inaudible 00:26:55]. I think a lot of it had to do with they didn't understand ... the brand manager didn't understand their own brand and what they want to say and want to look like, what they want it to feel like so it was ... I don't think they really put that together agency enough and ... but they didn't leave it up to the agency. Quite a lot of people calling the shots as well. A lot of clients have probably three, four. So within their ranks there, there was a lot of indecision. So within them they didn't know what they were really about. I mean I know a lot of ... obviously on a lot of, especially alcohol brands, there's a lot of rules and regulations and it is [inaudible 00:28:32]. You've gotta be sensitive. But within that there are a lot of brands out there that do take the risk and do reap the rewards. During the process? I think it ... no. It didn't. No. Didn't really. No. I kind of think it was the ads changed quite dramatically during the process. No. It didn't. We probably got ... we weren't very inspired at all by that point. It was kind of a point where we were just trying any angle, anything. Doesn't matter, you know? It just kind of got to ... we didn't know really what we were saying. We kind of knew what we were saying but we didn't know how to say it anymore. We'd gone through so many options. Kind of like the road we hadn't taken. What does that do? Just ... we weren't inspired but when it did spark something off, it did become quite exciting. It did take a while to get there. I think once we got there it was just kind of it was a great reward. [inaudible 00:31:05] there was cool. Yeah. I think it was kind of exhaustful [inaudible 00:31:11] or so we thought. To what they were telling us. It was fine. It was quite frustrating. It was frustrating. I don't think they knew either what the solution was. Strategy on that one. I think it was pretty much the same ... I don't think ... I don't think we got enough direction from them. I don't think the brief was quite right. The brand had gone through quite a rough patch. Probably five or six years of quite a bad patch and they were all over the show. There was no single line of thought. Just them saying different things. what would the right word be? It was just easy work. It was flat. It wouldn't ... it's nice. It's fine. It wouldn't do anything crazy and they eventually went with that after about a years worth of work on one TV script. So that was quite ... that pissed us off quite a bit. You know it works [inaudible 00:24:31] which is very boring. It's just fine. in the whiskey category. Would have been one of those ads that would have stood up and noticed. It ended up being something that was quite user friendly for all countries as well. A person in India, it'd be fine. I person in South America, it'd be fine and we understand. You know? Yeah. It just never went away. It just kept coming back. They'd go and research. We'd make some changes to a board. Put more black people, [inaudible 00:25:34], whatever you know. Do this. Just make subtle tweaks and go back sort of reverse and go back and no we need some more options. And we'd make some more. Why? I think client often wants to be everything to everyone. It happens too much. And you look at successful brands doing do that. No successful brand does that. I think it was a problem that's blown up. [inaudible 00:26:14] clients want to be nice to everybody. And you can't. Well you certainly can't have ... you won't be noticed if you want to do that. And I think that they did that on that job. Just want to play safe all the time. They do something interesting and I think those clients, which are still are clients [inaudible 00:26:55]. I think a lot of it had to do with they didn't understand ... the brand manager didn't understand their own brand and what they want to say and want to look like, what they want it to feel like so it was ... I don't think they really put that together agency enough and ... but they didn't leave it up to the agency. Quite a lot of people calling the shots as well. A lot of clients have probably three, four. You'd get like the head marketing director who'd agree with the ad and then the brand manager is disagreeing with it. We probably got ... we weren't very inspired at all by that point. It was kind of a point where we were just trying any angle, anything. Doesn't matter, you know? It just kind of got to ... we didn't know really what we were saying. We kind of knew what we were saying but we didn't know how to say it anymore. I think they kind of took us down a route or kind of approved a route, made little changes along the way on one route and then eventually said, `No, no, no. We can't do that. Do something else.` So I was part really frustrating because they didn't know what they would do. They wanted to say. And it was a lot of back and forth. They started sweating the small stuff and we didn't ... they didn't give us any real direction. You know, they didn't say that is right. They just kind of ... also got people sort of got lost along the way.   Kind of [inaudible 00:32:47] but presenting. I think we kind of ... I think we probably let it go for too long. Probably let it go for too long. We should have stopped a lot sooner. And said, this is a direction but if we're gonna start changing one scene all the time. Then now everybody has to wear you t-shirts because it's J&B color in TV ad. They'd start putting in things like that which in the big scheme of things is really irrelevant. That's sort of the kind of things they were coming back with and you know I think we kind of let that stuff ... let it get too far without looking at the big picture. You know what I mean? And we got of course kind of sucked into ... ou know? So I think there was a lot of frustrated ... I mean we were all in it together. We were all, you know, feeling a little bit worn out and, yeah. Obviously tense there just ... fucking [inaudible 00:34:32] please, come back with something. And they'd come back ... almost there. Can we just do this? Yeah, we'll do. I don't think they were a hard enough client as well. You know? So I think there was a lot of frustrated ... I mean we were all in it together. We were all, you know, feeling a little bit worn out and, yeah. Obviously tense there just ... fucking [inaudible 00:34:32] please, come back with something. And they'd come back ... almost there. Can we just do this? Yeah, we'll do. I don't think they were a hard enough client as well. Well because Kahn was here as well. Kahn jumped up an down, kicked and screamed. He was out front. He was there. So we couldn't take his word for it. It happened just say keep going. We're almost there you know? We'll get an ad out soon. I don't think they were forceful enough as clients because [inaudible 00:35:44] there which is ... fine. It's a fine add but it's not gonna have a local feel to it. It's not gonna belong to us [inaudible 00:35:56] do an ad for South Africans. So I think we were let down with them as well. They could have been a bit stronger.
