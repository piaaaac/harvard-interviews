Title: Successful Pediactric group in Houston/space & strategy Project in Medical industry

----

Text: And they function as a single unit but they want to grow and they've kinda been like taken over ... like, so I think that it was interesting for me just content wise, and that's always good when you see trends happening in the world and its like something you get to work on and think about. The project was difficult in some ways but it was really satisfying because I was able ... I feel like I was able to take on some primary responsibilities for things that I have been learning in my career here so that was really good. I mean one of my team members I was working with and I were just really in sync about that so even though the whole team wasn't necessarily sure about some of the directions we were taking things, I felt very, very strongly about it and luckily about more than have the team did. There was really just one person that wasn't on board, so that was the tension the whole time to feel like we saw this great area of opportunity and this really important behavior that we needed to grapple with that made the project more complicated but ultimately richer. No behavior of the industry and what was happening. So there were two things going on. Like the project was about the space so they are going to build new pediatric clinics. What should they be like and that's like very, very broadly so the doors were wide open. And they didn't know. I always get into these projects where they don't really know what they want us to do, which I - So we had to come up with a whole strategy piece and partially what was important was that there were these ... the fact of the matter is today 75% of the pediatricians in their group are women of child-bearing age. So, the change in the workforce in doctors is dramatically changed the practice of medicine for pediatricians. So that was really interesting to be able to delve into some of those concerns and how ... like how is medicine going to grapple with mothers as doctors, because its just not doing a good job right now. And its similar to what's going on in design and a lot of industries where you know there's all these bright young women who, you know are the children of the feminist, but our society and a lot of professions don't build in support for that. So, you know, suffice it to say, the work was really interesting, the client was into it, like they were glad that we were talking about that kind of stuff so that's always satisfying, to bring up something that they didn't necessarily ask you for and for them to be like yeah, that is really valuable. So this is a separate discussion which we have had more recently like quite often we are really creating briefs with our clients. So, its ... the brief doesn't guide the project. You know. Its kind of like, you have to put a few stakes in the ground and it helps a lot to sort of frame the scope but then, once the project starts you know, you go into whatever's the most important.c So I mean, just seeing what else is out there in the world, like I mean I got a flu shot at a ready clinic at a grocery store in like a poor neighborhood in Houston. So, you know that was sort of inspiring. this was really inspirational from the users point of view cause we were riding along with like parents with a newborn to go to their doctor's appointment, and just getting to see like what their whole journey was like and what their stress level was. nd then, a lot of the doctors were really inspiring. So just you know ... their passion for medicine, their interest, their live / work balance, and you know We got to interview a woman who had just had triplets. And she and her husband had been unable to have children, and they were both professionals so they were going through fertility treatment and they got triplets. So like her whole life changed. So that was like the difficult part. There was, I had a very close relationship with the researcher that we were working with. So has since left IDO but I worked with her probably throughout half my time here. So we're like great and we have really working relationship. There was a designer who was really junior who came in and he was really sweet but was not expected to participate as much in the strategy or like heavy lifting parts of it, just cause he wasn't ... that's not his strong suit yet. But he was good. There was a practice person on the team who was weeding the client relationship and then there was this difficulty where there was a guy who has been at IDO for a while but he had relocated here from another office. And he was supposed to be the project manager but it seems like only in name cause he had never done this type of project, with this type of client, and he just had a new baby. I probably pulled back and just like interacted with the people who were easiest for me to interact with I probably pulled back and just like interacted with the people who were easiest for me to interact with, to keep getting the work done and pushing forward and then this guys was left feeling kind of like frustrated - a couple of us felt like, yeah he's not really leading, he doesn't seem to have ideas when we come to the table day to day. So I'm just going to keep working, rather than look to somebody for leadership cause its kind of ... you know, you either have to be the leader or you're not. And you can have the title, it doesn't make it the case. feel like I was able to take on some primary responsibilities for things that I have been learning in my career here so that was really good. The project was difficult in some ways but it was really satisfying because I was able ... There was really just one person that wasn't on board, so that was the tension the whole time to feel like we saw this great area of opportunity and this really important behavior that we needed to grapple with that made the project more complicated but ultimately richer. And they didn't know. I always get into these projects where they don't really know what they want us to do, which I - And that has impacts on both sides, on the patient side and the physician side. So that was really interesting to be able to delve into some of those concerns and how ... like how is medicine going to grapple with mothers as doctors, because its just not doing a good job right now. And its similar to what's going on in design and a lot of industries where you know there's all these bright young women who, you know are the children of the feminist, but our society and a lot of professions don't build in support for that. So it was an opportunity for us to say how can this new strategy of like their pediatric clinics and what the centers are going to be like. How can that have some nod to the reality of the doctor's lives so that in some way the doctors are the users and the patients are the users, and to try to bring those two things together. Yeah, I mean. So this is a separate discussion which we have had more recently like quite often we are really creating briefs with our clients. [inaudible 00:24:03] a lot of sources of inspiration. So I mean, just seeing what else is out there in the world, like I mean I got a flu shot at a ready clinic at a grocery store in like a poor neighborhood in Houston. So, you know that was sort of inspiring. Yeah, so it was interesting in its way. And then, a lot of the doctors were really inspiring. So just you know ... their passion for medicine, their interest, their live / work balance, and you know, this was really inspirational from the users point of view cause we were riding along with like parents with a newborn to go to their doctor's appointment, and just getting to see like what their whole journey was like and what their stress level was. I mean there were so many really inspiring things that were about how tough it is to just like get to the pediatrician. She was very like clear, and very directive but every open to our design process and really looking for innovation and looking to push the doctors a little bit. So, it was a struggle to feel like you know like the pieces just never all fit into place. So, in a way, I probably pulled back and just like interacted with the people who were easiest for me to interact with, to keep getting the work done and pushing forward and then this guys was left feeling kind of like frustrated -  Cause, you know, a couple of us felt like, yeah he's not really leading, he doesn't seem to have ideas when we come to the table day to day. So I'm just going to keep working, rather than look to somebody for leadership cause its kind of ... you know, you either have to be the leader or you're not. And you can have the title, it doesn't make it the case.
