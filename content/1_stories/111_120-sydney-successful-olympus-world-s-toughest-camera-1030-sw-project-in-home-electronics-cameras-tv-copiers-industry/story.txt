Text: So, it was a month, I believe in the planning. Jane and Andy were very adamant that we could sell this idea to the point that were literally saying that this is a great ad, it could be great. So it's great to have that kind of leadership from the beginning. The client very slowly came around, with a lot of reservations, but when we got the director on board, Paul Mandich, which is probably one of the best directors around, that then kind of gave us a bit more kind of look we know what we are talking about. At the end of the day the ad was pretty good, and all the things that came out, and the response so far has been pretty great. The client very slowly came around, with a lot of reservations It was hideous. I've not yet seen them react that way, or not heard of them react that way since or before. We literally were saying, get rid of the dog, and their whole products. It's almost as if I was to say to you, lose the energizer bunny, and that's how they saw it. They said, you can't. The brand is the dog. I said no it's not, your product is what it's all about. So yeah, there was a lot of adversity, a lot. To the point where they were going, nah, nah. The briefing when we got it you mean? We got it a week before it was due. Everyone else had a crack at it and we were put on it at the last minute, and they said look see if you guys can do something. So yeah a week is a lot to do, for a brand like this, both Jane and Andy wanted something really good. Mark's twin brother was the client The relationship was pretty good, we knew we had at least one of the decision makers not being in favor of this but willing to hear us out as opposed to going nah nah nah nah nah. But one of the key decision makers from Olympus was very adamant that they couldn't lose the dog entirely, so we just at least have him in the van in part of the script, so he does link a little performance, and it's quite nice, but he is definitely not the, the focus of the ad. Creative team or... Ah, You know, having a week to crack a big brief is not a lot but once we came to them with the idea, we literally said, it's so tough it's like nothing ever happened, they got it. Mark and myself have a great relationship, and we have a great relationship with Jane and Andy, but once we got to the point, they said yeah great, let's write it up, and we had a script and that got to it so, we've never, I've never had a problem with that point of the process at all, no, it's good. With Olympus we're likely because we have probably got one of the better account guys on it Pete Boz. Once he saw the idea, he was yeah we will sell it, and he was on board all the way. So from, I suppose, from the get go, he was there saying, okay, if we are going to sell this thing we are going to have to show them, just wear them down. Whatever they come up with we have to have the finances for. So having the support was key. Simple things like explaining to them that you don't need to thinks still in the eighties or nineties and having and mnemonic device to sell a product. You know, like apple just go, look it's cool and people buy shit loads of it it you know. And what we're saying is, ours is tough, you can break it and it won't break, you know, it's unbreakable. And they go okay. So we came in with a strategist laid out.  But one of the key decision makers from Olympus was very adamant that they couldn't lose the dog entirely, so we just at least have him in the van in part of the script, so he does link a little performance, and it's quite nice, but he is definitely not the, the focus of the ad.   It's almost as if I was to say to you, lose the energizer bunny, and that's how they saw it. They said, you can't. The brand is the dog. I said no it's not, your product is what it's all about. So yeah, there was a lot of adversity, a lot. To the point where they were going, nah, nah.
