Title: Successful Anti-smoking/health promotion board Project in Health/wellness industry

----

Text: The statistics show that there are more female smokers and they are basically doing it because they see smoking as cool. It's a status thing back to the times when, you know, [inaudible 00:10:03] happened, and all of those things were cool. So what we did was - Well, because in the market there are lots of advertising about beauty and how women at this age stay actually very confident about the way they look and everything. So that's one of the main insights that actually came to the concept. So I mean, initially when it came out the idea people were thinking, like "Okay I don't know how this is going to work" because, I mean, first of all it's really disgusting. We didn't know exactly how open the client would be because they're so used to seeing the conventional ads like aging, you know, women aging and how you will die because you smoke and all that. To be honest, I mean I'm a smoker. Okay, right? But those things don't really have any impact on me. But the thing about this campaign is it's not to stop people from smoking, it's to prevent girls from smoking. So there's a slight difference. And we were quite surprised that they were actually very receptive to that because it's something that's completely brand new. Nobody has ever done that before and it actually did very well. There was lots of press around it and all that stuff so it was pretty good. So that is actually an example of almost - it's more of a guerrilla form so it's something that's not exactly very common. Not commonly used in the media, so this way of advertising. You don't put it in magazines and all that stuff. It's kind of like the trend now. Budget was pretty tight but the time was pretty okay. I think we - we did everything in about a month and a half maybe? Around there which is very good. Oh, simply to go against conventional media. Yeah, so we just needed something that is different from the usual magazine ads and press and all that stuff. So we figured that [inaudible 00:16:12] for a woman was like, 18-24 here. I mean, they're always out shopping. It is seen as important. Oh, simply to go against conventional media. Yeah, so we just needed something that is different from the usual magazine ads and press and all that stuff. So we figured that [inaudible 00:16:12] for a woman was like, 18-24 here. I mean, they're always out shopping. It is seen as important. So, we should catch them when they're doing something that they like most. When they're most unguarded basically. When they're walking down [inaudible 00:16:29] road and then, "Oh [inaudible 00:16:30]" It was very good. We actually managed to get them really excited about this project which was - yeah it was really good. Very accepted as well. In fact, we were the ones who came up with the whole formula of making the horrible perfume.  I guess when we first shared with them the idea they were probably - they were pretty excited but I think their may concern was like "It's so different from the brief" like "how are we going to sell this" so. One thing that we want you to do is don't worry. Leave it to us. To us it's like - most of the time you need to pre-sell the work. So we don't exactly have a lot of problems with assessing what we need. So what you'll do is to help us to work out of offices and everything once we decide which one the client's going with. So yeah, there's really not much of a problem with them. At that time we actually took a more guerilla approach. So what we actually did was - we actually had an event to launch a perfume and the perfume actually smells like a cigarette. So it's almost like the day after night at the party would be cigarette. So it's a whole big campaign launched, and it's down at [inaudible 00:10:56] Road as a big special show, and everyone's like [inaudible 00:10:59] and there are actually girls giving out perfume strips like test strips and it stinks. Yeah, so we just needed something that is different from the usual magazine ads and press and all that stuff. So we figured that [inaudible 00:16:12] for a woman was like, 18-24 here. I mean, they're always out shopping. It is seen as important. So, we should catch them when they're doing something that they like most. When they're most unguarded basically. When they're walking down [inaudible 00:16:29] road and then, "Oh [inaudible 00:16:30]" Yeah, we actually went out and tested with alcohol and we had to dig up ashtray cigarette butts and it was disgusting so yeah.
