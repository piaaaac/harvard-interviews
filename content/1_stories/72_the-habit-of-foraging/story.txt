Title: The habit of foraging

----

Text: One of the things that also has spurred me on this month is foraging free foods, because whilst Iâ€™m a long way from the food banks, fortunately, I certainly still need to count my pennies, as many of us I'm sure are. And, and there's so much free food out there, and it's a thing that people have got out of the habit of foraging. So, it's good for our wellbeing as well as getting some goodies.
