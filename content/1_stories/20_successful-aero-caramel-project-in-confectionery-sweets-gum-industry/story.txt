Title: Successful Aero caramel Project in Confectionery/sweets/gum industry

Text: Well, everything's always positive in the end when it works. There's no real negatives because once it's happened it's happened, but- But the whole concept is there's this total luxurious woman getting dressed, all sexy, sexy. There's no real concept as such, but then she bites the Aero and it dribbles out, and she's holding it like you would, like doing a blowjob. Seriously, and this is Nestle we're talking. And some of it drops on her dress, like [inaudible 00:27:33]. And she, instead of getting upset ... It's like a five thousand buck dress, it's beautiful. And instead she just scoops it up with her finger like this and, mm, and sticks it back into her mouth. And it's like talking about the indulgence of Aero. But no, we wrote the script, we thought there's no way on God's earth that Nestle is gonna ever buy this, because their umbrella over everything is, "Good food, good life," and if it doesn't fit into good food or good life, it ain't gonna happen. And blowjobs are strictly off Nestle's radar. t's like a five thousand buck dress, it's beautiful.

And blowjobs are strictly off Nestle's radar. Anyway, so you see this thing, they didn't mention blowjobs but they saw the whole luxury, the sexuality, the indulgence, the sexiness of it, and they bought it. And then you've got this really good director who does fashion photography, and he actually filmed this. And it's like, it's almost porn. It's like Vogue photography, Vogue magazine. And it's like, you know, it's almost ... It's just missing the Vaseline on the lens. And the ad turned out so beautifully, and Nestle loves it, and there was not a single step of the way there was a single problem. Once people all buy into the front, things go smoothly and they never go wrong. If people are a little bit hesitant on the front, there'll be changes all the way along the process, and that's gonna kill the ad at the end of the day.  This Aero one came straight after the huge success of Bayer One. If this ad had come before Bayer One, it would never have got off the ground. Again, based on a couple of good experiences, client's risk tolerance, client's trust, client's everything, goes way up. Make one mistake and it goes way down. Yeah. Well it wasn't a huge budget because it's just a variant brand, but it was a good budget. It was about a million bucks or something. We got a top, top, top model. We could afford a really good model, really good photography. It was all good. Timing was tight. It wasn't because of the launch, it was because they had to get the thing done in the financial year. But it happened. We were working like the week before Christmas which sucked [inaudible 00:32:16], but it was done. No one had to work nights, you know? No. But there's no such thing as there's an insane timing. If you're working late, your time has been crap. Aero? Very good now. It's the Nestle client service. Nikki, she's great, fantastic. We get on very well with the Nestle client service. It wasn't always like that, but that person- This one's fantastic, yeah. But no, we wrote the script, we thought there's no way on God's earth that Nestle is gonna ever buy this, because their umbrella over everything is, "Good food, good life," and if it doesn't fit into good food or good life, it ain't gonna happen. And blowjobs are strictly off Nestle's radar. There's no real concept as such, but then she bites the Aero and it dribbles out, and she's holding it like you would, like doing a blowjob.

And blowjobs are strictly off Nestle's radar. We decided it was good, and then with client service, one person, strat one person, and then ultimately, manager director or something. But normally here the top management kind of trusts the marketing or client service people, so you don't go running to daddy every time, you know? They kind of stick here when things fuck up, not when things are going right. Quite loose. "Aero's got a new caramel variant, PS see existing Aero briefs," which is, "Aero is a brand of luxury, indulgence, sexiness, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah." So we've been working with Aero for years, so you take all the basic Aero attributes, and say, "And now with caramel.
