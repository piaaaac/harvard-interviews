Title: Threatens the foundations

----

Text: There are links between the now infamous wildlife markets and coronavirus. Perhaps less known is the global link between both of these and intensive farming, which has pushed small farmers out of farming domestic species and into catching or breeding wild animals, and has consumed ever more land, colonising the spaces inhabited by wild animals, and allowing easy disease transfer between these worlds. Covid-19 is the latest but by no means the only disease linked to intensive animal farming. Intensive farming creates conditions which allow diseases to thrive: overcrowding and compromised immune systems due to stress. The industry response is to routinely use antibiotics as a preventative measure, contributing greatly to the growing antimicrobial resistance which threatens the foundations of our healthcare repository, with potentially catastrophic results. As explorer and naturalist John Muir said, “When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the Universe.” It is time to lose the anthropocentric notion that we can set ourselves above and apart from all other beings, and predict or control the outcomes of our actions. Every animal whose life is touched by these scenarios was put in that position by humans. Thus, it is just as unfair and illogical to blame coronavirus on bats as it is to blame pigs for chewing off each others’ tails, as a consequence of their constricted existence.
