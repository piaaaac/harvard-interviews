Title: 17 NYC Unsuccessful Smirnoff Project in Alcohol industry

----

Text: Okay. So our very first project we worked on was for Smirnoff. Smirnoff cocktails. And it was a brief that had been swimming around for something like three months before we got there, and then the client had declined several ideas and finally got to us. We had an idea that we were happy, it checked off all their boxes, and then slowly, over about four months, just became diluted. Very diluted, and got squeezed until it was nothing. It was because of the ineptitude of the client, and just them pushing and on their side, way too many layers to go through. There was about six, five layers ... Probably five layers, all with the ability to kill and put their two cents in, but none with the ability to say `Yes, do this.` So it was just an arduous process, going back and forth, which just pretty much drained any creativity out of it whatsoever. Too many to count. Upwards of 30 plus. Zero. Social aspect of it, the ease of use, the great taste. It's introducing new, make sure they know it's new. Make sure the beautiful bottle is highlighted. Did I already say the aspect of occasions? It's enjoyed in social settings. That's what I can remember off the top of my head Timing, actually, initially no. But again, when it came to revisions, the client would come back and things would have to be changed in a very short amount of time. Budget was not an issue. I mean, it didn't cause any angst between us two. I guess, if anything, we would just bitch to each other. We had, luckily, one of the best account guys worked with, who's no longer here, who was just as frustrated as we were, if not more so. Because he had to deal with the client every day. And at some point, the client went above his head and that just turned into a mess for him, for us. So with our specific account guy who was initially on the project, it was kind of like he was always the bearer of bad news. If anyone had to deliver it, he was the best to do it. But once it went over his head, it was just a nightmare. We had an idea that we were happy, it checked off all their boxes, and then slowly, over about four months, just became diluted.

I remember it was trying to say about seven things. Seven different messages. Too many messages all jammed into this one little brief, one print ad. Yeah, frighteningly obvious. But just, we ended up with a concept about ... It was so easy, the drink is perfect, you need to only master your pour. It was kind of ... What's it called? Bartenders flash, you know when they flip the bottle around and catch it and pour a drink. I guess it'd be the same two or three, but it would always be different ones and they'd have different opinions. Some were okay, some ... no one could make ... It was horrible.
