Title: It is not acceptable

----

Text: Edinburgh Community Food’s work has previously focused on food insecurity, but not from the crisis end. However, due to Covid-19, that changed overnight. In a decent society it is not acceptable what’s happening with food right now. We need colour and breadth of food choices to inspire children. People need to have the money to have food disasters! Food brings us together. We upheld our dignity and values throughout our Covid-19 response work, where we bought fresh fruit and veg to give to people. This really transforms their food experience and the quality of what they get. Meals in a bag and food from different cuisines really got people engaged with cooking and eating. It’s key to keep in mind that when parachuting food in and helping people in crisis, they can become reliant, and struggle when an organisation pulls out. For people with dependency issues, choices around food can therefore be very important. Throughout lockdown we also undertook a BME survey focusing on food choices, enabling them to provide tailored, culturally appropriate boxes. We must all recognise the social value of food.
