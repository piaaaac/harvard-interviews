Text: You know, it's a big task to get the right people on the project. Once you've got the right team, then that's half the battle.  But then again, the other side of it obviously is the client, and how much the client can emphasis with you and how much you can emphasize with the client; you know, understanding their kind of business goals and that kind of stuff is a big part of it. Just you know, I mean, I'm a project manager and just one of the big things that I think, I mean that I think I'm always thinking about is good communication and communicating with the client and making sure you understand their point of view. You try your hardest to, understand their goals; then that's what makes a project go well really. Because then I can relay that back to the team and make sure that work in the direction that we are going in is not only creative, and new, and all them things that design should be like, and cool, and whatever. But it is also like aligning yourself very much with the business sort of goal and making the brief at the end of the day. I mean the content, the content has got a lot to do with it, whether you think the projects gone well or not and getting all of those elements together, the best team who understand the content before they even start the project or have some sort of background in the content. You know its kind of scary when you, a lot of the time we do projects here where teams here have not done much work in that content area and you feel fairly out of depth and its quite hard to understand whether you're doing well or not, because you are always in this kind of fog of like are we doing well or not, you know, because we have never done it before. And if you've never done something before, it's a very stressful situation to be in, like, and I try to avoid that as much as possible. But you know, most of my projects are you know, pretty standard industry design, software design that kind of stuff, design strategy stuff, where I am pretty experienced in that side of things. So that is one of the big factors that makes a project go well, whether you're experienced or not. I mean, the clients the big thing really, if the client is an arse, you can have a nightmare. There are only two ways about it. Because we all have little specialties, little kind of you know, [inaudible 00:11:13] whose been on my team is like a brilliant instructions guy, he's great visual interaction design. Whereas there are other interaction designers who are better at you know, doing things, like I don't know, different types of interaction design. So you've got to kind of say, “what kind of project is this? What kinds of demands is going to make [inaudible 00:11:33]”. You know are we designing -- I've just designed a remote control for televisions so you make sure you get an industrial designer who knows about devices, not an industry designer whose might have been doing food and beverage packaging for the last 3 year or somethings, you know what I mean. Or mobile, you know someone who has done mobile phones extensively. So that team, getting that team things started out; but then, because we are on office, there are a whole bunch of projects going around at the same time; its about trying, that's hard because people get resourced onto the projects at the time of signing. So if you are trying to get a project team together and you haven't gotten a signature for a contract, then your best interaction designer goes to that team over there; then you, you know. I'm in the raw. Everyone at Ideal is great, I'm not saying that we have got shit designers, cause we haven't; but there are people who are suited to do things better, so you might end up with a team that is not perfect for the content area, so that's what happens. Resources, just a fucking nightmare, its just a nightmare scenario resourcing. I don't know, we have gotten so many systems in this office over the last ten years, over resourcing and again it's about, there is no one way to do this; it's about blood and tears. Its like people sitting in the room, sketching people out and fighting over resourcing. I've been in meetings where you know, people are getting upset about like who is on what project. And its really tricky because I don't know what the answer is to it really. Resourcing is such a messy business. So one good thing is to just a really nice backup of freelancers, trusted, tried and tested freelancers that we know are going to deliver; and we've used quite a few of them on my projects, cause you know, you can't do it without -- I mean the client often says like, can we translate this document to whatever, like great and you've got to do it overnight. There is nobody in the office that is going to do that for you, and you've just got to make sure that you have people so the networks are really important. And it was a really nice project in the sense that it was what we call a fair-zero; so it was like, go out in the world and find out what peoples navigational needs are. And then again, the team was great, we had a really great team. We went all over the world, it was fucking great, I remember driving down like, we did, it is a navigation device, we hired shit loads of cars and we stuck navigation devices in our wind screens and we drove across America and stuff, and it was just unbelievable. We drove from, right down the west coast of America in a ford mustang; and that's pretty cool.   And then we met all these great people, these users, which was really inspiring. And then the great, the other great, some of the great outcomes of that was that the company then really kind of embedded our process and our user sort of centered language in a way into their marketer and it not only, it didn't just make the device; you know it started talking about the, it started marketing. I mean this is a great example of like how our user insights will draw their marketing, because their user insights; because now their marketing says “We went out to see users and users said blah blah blah, and users said this, because users wanted that”. And its just really direct from the horses mouth; users wanted this, we've designed it. Most companies don't really do that honest marketing approach, they just talk bullshit so that was nice. (Phone rings) Oh shit. The biggest reason why they have gone well is because we've managed to get the best team together; so that has a big influence on how the project goes, just getting the right people. And that is not easy. Contemporary art just asks more questions in a way, whereas the work we do shuts down questions and answers questions; it does, you can ask more questions, but the goal of our work is to ask more questions and to have a final thing, And then again, the team was great, we had a really great team. And then we met all these great people, these users, which was really inspiring. And then the great, the other great, some of the great outcomes of that was that the company then really kind of embedded our process and our user sort of centered language in a way into their marketer and it not only, it I mean this is a great example of like how our user insights will draw their marketing, because their user insights; because now their marketing says “We went out to see users and users said blah blah blah, and users said this, because users wanted that”. And its just really direct from the horses mouth; users wanted this, we've designed it.
