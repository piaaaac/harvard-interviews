Text: But the thing that was the most successful about it was the way the team worked together, and the skill sets, and the personality of the team. In that everyone was a very strong contributor, but respected each other, but also had healthy debates. So it wasn't like there was one person said something and everyone else did it. It was very much a shared load, and I think we all leaned on each other a little bit, and it felt like things moved very quickly. And there was no dead weight on the team, so to speak. Everyone was a big part of the solution. I think the place that we reached from a concept standpoint felt sort of like a breakthrough. So I think once we got to a point where the solution felt really good, that that invigorated the team to move forward. It was definitely a very difficult project. And like I said, I rolled on late so a lot of the difficulty happened before I even got there. So I think that the beginning of the project might not have been so smooth for the rest of the team. But I've been through a few experiences here where the team dynamics were a little off, or that people didn't understand each other's skills or something like that. And this just felt like a really healthy, respectful, strong environment. And it was nice to be a part of that.

So I think once we got to a point where the solution felt really good, that that invigorated the team to move forward. It was definitely a very difficult project. I don't think budget was a big constraint, but time was a constraint because the nature of the project was very high level and, therefore, a lot of thinking through things in work. So I think that schedule wise we did well, and hours wise I think we did fairly well. Like we didn't work crazy, crazy hours and people didn't get really burned out. But it always felt like crunch time. We had two researchers working in collaboration with each other and [inaudible 00:17:28] from the service design and an industrial designer and myself. So I think we all came from little bit of a different background, but knew each other well enough that we respected each other's capabilities and things.

I would say were sort of more of a consultant base, but they definitely helped launch things forward. They were integral, but not a hundred percent involved. Difficult. We had, and I didn't deal directly with the client, but the client was the mid level client who wasn't necessarily the decision maker or the most open minded thinker. I think was very high maintenance, as far as the time that he required. And he was sort of nervous, and always needed to see things earlier than we were ready with them to deliver them.  I think they were great, and that's one of the reasons that I felt like it was successful. I think that it works much better that way.
