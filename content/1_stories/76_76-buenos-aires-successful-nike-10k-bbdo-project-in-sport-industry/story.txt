Text: Well, that trail was in Libertador and Quintana in the Recoleta neighborhood.  There were some risks but they took them on.  The idea was worth those risks and it was really good. Yes, it was a medium risk and they took it. It was very – they became very involved with the ideas.  If they had to say, “This doesn’t go.”  They had arguments to say no.  Some clients tell you, “No because I don’t like it.”  And that’s not a valid answer.  Why don’t you like it?  What is it not communicating or what is it doing wrong?  I don’t like it is not a good argument.  I don’t like green.  The question is why don’t you like green?  In general this client – in other companies was not like that.  That’s what I tell you, the same client in different projects can change a lot.  So for this project they were really supportive, they said no with arguments. Maybe it wasn’t like that in other projects.  They said, “I don’t like it.” In my opinion is that sometimes you feel that it’s a round project and the brand doesn’t get very involved.  In the end – what’s not very important always works best in the end.  When they feel that it’s something very important, instead of helping it flow, they create a lot of obstacles and they don’t realize that the process is a lot worse that way and so is the quality of the ideas.  But it’s very hard to create that kind of relationship.  If the TV spot is very important for them, you can take them through other roads.  Now, with TV you probably won’t be able to top the idea. Because it’s so important to them and they get too involved and they look for too many explanations for something that isn’t as rational.  In general we are sometimes against the famous testing because you analyze reasons that shouldn’t be analyzed.  “No because I don’t like the woman’s hairdo.”  And then they tell you but hey, let’s go to the core of the idea.  It doesn’t matter how she’s wearing her hair. You take apart the idea and it loses its value. No, it think it’s very complex. They think very differently in general. There are cases of great brands where things work great, where client and agency work as – in reality that thing were “The client bounces this back” is kind of old.  You really have to work as a team.  He has the brand and knows it.  We try to get informed to get to know the brand but it is true that if I set a matrix and it may work for some projects but not for others.  That matrix won’t assure you that it will work.  I won’t say, “Let’s do this and it will work for every project.”  It’s like everything, when you have a very strict matrix, you get tired of it.  There will come a time where he will tire of those ideas because you will have to fit them into that rigid matrix.  So it’s kind of a balance between a not so rigid matrix. The thing is that it’s hard because maybe what looks hard for us might not look that way to them; it might look pretty flexible to them.  I don’t know.  In general, that discussion between accounts and creative is further away although it still exists.  That moment where the account person tells you, “No, I cannot say that.”  And you think we’ll let the client decide, why aren’t we presenting this?  “No, because I know the client.”  “Let’s go.” The only thing he will say is “change this for me.”  It’s not that terrible.

No, pretty good.  Obviously there are fights in some processes but it’s the logical thing in any process. We didn’t beat each other.  There were pretty intense fights in general over time because sometimes the client and the account people think that ideas come out of the blue and they don’t.  So it’s always that discussion of having more time.  What happens is that you also have a deadline and everybody is running to make it to that date. Very well, too.  In genera’s like that project that comes out perfect, where we are pretty much on the same page about where to take it.  It was a round project. Did you see that when you go to the subway you go through that 0:27:49.8, in reality it’s almost automatic, but what we did was paste that 0:28:00.1 and so now everybody can run.  Inspiration comes from the fact that you like running and you try to share that moment and to use that idea that everybody can make i what’s not very important always works best in the end.
