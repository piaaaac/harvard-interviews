Title: Cherish our local food producers

----

Text: For me, Covid 19 has woken me up to the importance of my local food system and the civic responsibility I have to and champion it. The small shops and food service businesses who have pivoted so agilely in an attempt to survive and serve their customers have been a real inspiration. They have helped to convert my wished for and thought about behavioural change to actual behavioural change in terms of where I shop, what food and drink I buy, the strength of relationships I have develop with these providers and the pleasure I get from knowing my spending is supporting their businesses, suppliers, staff and families. Prior to Covid 19, the Beach House Cafe (last photo I took pre covid from inside) in Portobello was a nice to visit cafe, since Covid 19 it has become our main grocery shop. One that knows our name, will flex to our diaries and work commitments and who have shown us great care, energy and commitment throughout. They are a shining example of what Covid 19 has thought me. Cherish our local food producers, businesses and organisations as they truly are key workers that deliver so much more than our cupboard basics.
