Title: Successful Audi (Tokyo) pitch Project in Transportation industry

----

Text: Yeah, it was pretty tight. We had a week, I think. Less than a week, entering the weekend. Yeah the first round we got on Friday, and then two days later Monday we had the first meeting. So that was really tight, less than a week. Yeah, pretty good. You have to have the right kind of people, otherwise ... If you don't have too many stumbling blocks within the agencies it's very good. I guess that's why we work with the client to test for the base in Tokyo. They dealt with the client, they had them. So they would screen if it was too wrong or too not Japanese, then they would tell us. Then we would rework the stuff. So we had some kind of buffer zone between us and the client.
