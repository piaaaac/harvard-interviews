Title: 214 LONDON Successful SKT remote control  Project in Home electronics/cameras/TV/copiers industry

Text: Yes, very, very different. And so, when I arrived in January, there was this whole discussion in the office about that everything was bogged down in research and a lot of the designers were feeling like, `Oh, I spend so much time thinking and not doing.` And I think the HF team has been kind of labeled with this kind of `Research, Research` than `Design`. And so, with the SKT one, it was really great, because I kind of came in and we were designing straight from the beginning of the sketching and everything and the whole team doing it and it was amazing how that really lifted you to see the design of specific designers really engaged with the project, because it wasn't seen as `HF phase`, ` design phase`. It was very much very integrated quickly. And that was really nice. Everyone kept commenting, `Oh, [inaudible 00:09:37]`, and that was really, really nice, because as a team, together, we really wanted to do this let's design and think and understand all at the same time. And that was really nice. It's a very positive thing amongst the team. So, I'd say, for me, that was the biggest thing that stood out. A lot of people in the HF guys have been talking about this saying, `Let's start talking about this SKT project`, about how we can design out front and about how that's good for inspiration, as well as going out and seeing and observing and talking to people. That's kind of really inspiring for the team internally. So, that was the one thing that I found very frustrating. I've got some some good design skills and abilities, but I've never quite been able to use those fully. So, that's kind of why coming Ideo was very nice and [inaudible 00:12:09] SKT project, I thought I wanted designers on the team and not just an HF person. We all felt like designers, so... That was like, for that project, really quite empowering, actually. It was really quite nice, considering the discussions that had been going on internally about how to start reframing this HF phase and getting out of that and reframing it as design research instead. Yeah, everything in the office was all products like remote controls and, in particular, this project was quite unusual for me to think I would still do this kind of work. But, yes, it was very, very different. So, I think, the way in which we think about things here and now is a lot broader because of that. Now I see it, when I come here now, we do think bigger extremes, where before, I felt, that we thought often within the boundaries of the actual product rather than thinking much broader about other extremes of behaviors and how that could influence our thinking. Where, now, I feel it seems to be much broader thinking. That's a strange one actually, because it was a really awkward... A really unusual... Sorry, unusual in terms of western client collaboration, I'd say, but probably normal for Asian. We had a core project team that we were working with and that was our day to day communication. I would say there was one person on that team that was the decision maker within the next big cell of decision makers, the big wigs sitting at the top. So, he was the kind of linchpin between the two, but he was not always there, so then he had the sub core team that would be working on a day to day basis with us. They'd be kind of feeding, kind of like a ladder up and down and all the decisions. So, from Ant and Steve on our project, it would go through various people. Safe to say, I think, four maximum different key decision makers on that team and then fed through and interpreted, sometimes incorrectly, through the smaller core team. So it was, I'd say, four people that make the decisions on their side through various filters both ways and then for us, Ant and Steve driving the process this end. No, no. It was often... It took us some time to get to that. I think when decisions were needed to be made, we started kind of uncovering cracks in that process and they haven't fully explained that kind of decision process. Eight weeks in? Eight weeks in when they started to pick our cracks in communication between them and thinking, `This is not quite running as smoothly.` And then kind of checking back and then creating down time for us, where we needed to use it, but they wanted to make decisions. Big words, but big guts when it comes down to it. Huge, right at the beginning, you know, we were employing you because want big change. We want to really kind of push the boundaries and the big word to them was `differentiate` and in the market everything's the same. So, they really spoke very heavily about all of that, but as we moved through, they started stepping back from big decisions. `We're not ready to do that, we don't want to do that.` So, our big ideas started being pinched and we had to reframe how we were thinking things because of that. So, I would say, their willingness to take risks was actually... I would say, it changed. I would say, at the beginning, how they set the scene, I would say it was high. It then went to low as we started getting into the design details and manufacturing possibilities. And then, I would actually say, we managed to stop pushing them out again and explaining that if we do this, you differentiate, if we do this, you achieve this in the market. So, I think it was high, it dipped very low, and then we managed to push it back up again. Low/medium, yeah. To get them to just push the boundaries a little bit forward and take a little bit more risk. But that did constrain the ways we did it. But, yeah, I think we dipped very low and then managed to start pushing them out again and getting them to understand where they could really make big gains through only making certain strategic decisions, instead of all of them. I think we were cherry picking the ones that would have the biggest impact on the user and there was also balance in terms of their manufacturing capabilities, where we felt that they would be comfortable to move forward as well. So, it was kind of a fine balancing act, I think. There's some things that we would do a bit earlier on, instead of leaving it as it was and I think after me after trying to encourage them to push things forward, make decisions earlier on... But also, the expectations around the deliverable, I think, were potentially, our deliverable, was back in the guidelines. And I think maybe they saw it as a false specification. So I think some of the differences in handing over between the two offices. Something slipped through the net, I think, and we were having to deal with those on the fly, really, and kind of just managed those as we went. This was something about because we were handing over a kind semi finished sort of designed guideline. We felt it was necessary that there was potentially an opportunity to have some kind of user testing to understand were we covered? It's just about what is right now, let's test and see whether that would work, part of the design and how we'll change that. And that wasn't kind of specked in as part of the product, but that's something, as a team, we all would've included. That was something we inanely encouraged the client that was a necessary part in the next stage of work that they would do to actually incorporate that, because we couldn't have passed it with the kind of project scope. So yeah, I think there was certain things that we would just do differently, just because we work differently. And I think it was... We did comment on those. It's amazing when you hand over a project that's been defined by a different office. How differently, as a team, you'd do that and do things quite sort of different time frames of things and how long you'll spend on certain things, so, that was quite interesting. Trying to fit in with the Palo Alto framework of scope of work. I think, with that, we work closely with the BD guy out in the states to do that, so there was kind of a forehand over to the UK, over to the London office. But with someone with [inaudible 00:29:02] from the kind of Palo Alto office, so that he was always kind of a link in, because SKT originally had the conversations with the Palo Alto office and Charles, in particular. He remained kind of on the side of the project, I think we can maintain that connection. So, he'd already had a relationship with the company and had worked on previous projects, so he remained as kind of within the team as a check in point, would make regular calls, would kind of understand whether the SKT team was fully up to speed on what we were currently doing now. So it was kind of like a check in process. I think potentially to keep the SKT team happy... Well, I don't know if it was actually that necessary, because I think we controlled the ups and downs and day to day changes of what happened in the project, so I'm not sure that was a complete necessary thing. I don't know how [crosstalk 00:30:06] felt about that. There was a whole issue about the translation. There was one guy on the project, but very [inaudible 00:30:20] educated in America. And his personally feelings about how the design should be often clouded clear communication between the team. And so, he would drip feed. Yeah and he would drip feed what he felt was necessary through to the rest of the client team, so that became another thing to deal with. We started to have to manage that.  Yeah and he would drip feed what he felt was necessary through to the rest of the client team, so that became another thing to deal with. We started to have to manage that. He would taint it. So, that made communication lengthy and difficult, because someone in the team would then ask it in a kind of broken English, we would understand. And we thought we'd just explained that ten minutes ago, but he'd obviously hadn't included it in the discussion, so you'd be startled after a while to figure out he isn't being completely honest. [inaudible 00:31:22] in all translations. I think it got to the fact that on all the key important documents, we had them translated, because the guys at the top were making decisions... He would be feeding the documents through and translating them, so this would say this, that would say that. In the end, the ones that really were critical in the guys fully understanding our design thinking, we had those translated. Yeah, internally here, so there was no misinterpretation. Everything that was on that, the CEO's would all have a clear understanding of what that was and so they could make a clear decision. So, that's kind of how we ended up resolving that particular sticky situation. I would say that there wasn't enough... Because writing up the documentation was so lengthy to ensure that the right stuff was going through to the guys that mattered, because we'd been communicating with them on a day to day basis. It made things much more bogged down, in detail, then we would normally have, I'd say, with any other clients [inaudible 00:33:11] or wonder, didn't have that level of communication internally. And it added an extra element of us being more thorough with how we documented it and gave across our design thinking and thought processes. So, I'd say, that, in itself, started to... It kind of really was heavy on the project team. In terms of doing the work, but also explaining why they're doing it. It added another element, so... The rest of it, I'd say, if that hadn't been necessary, would have been a really well specked out, timely project. Fluctuation a lot, I'd say. From my side in particular, because they don't give much feedback. They're not `this is really bad`, `this is really good`... It's actually quite tough when you've worked on something and they don't actually give you any feedback. They just go, `Okay, that's fine.` Then they kind of [inaudible 00:35:15] agree to it, but they don't pass any comment to you. It's really demoralizing when you've worked your back side off and you don't get anything from them. You get no emotional connection, so I'd say emotional connection's very low. And there was a lot of drip feeding and hand holding and explaining about what we're doing throughout. So, I'd say actually time spent with them was quite lengthy, but a complete lack of emotional connection with them, which is quite demoralizing. So, yeah, I think that'd probably be the way of summarizing it. I think, at last minute, I think it could've only kind of been different if the client core team felt confident in their ability to pass judgment and make comments. I felt because they were the middle playing field between management and us, that's all they ever did was kind of pass information and feed between the two sources. So, I think if they would've been able to have a position of value on the team and I think that would've changed then greatly. I think that was probably the problem, they couldn't do that. And yeah, I think that's probably the frustrating thing for us, as a team. They didn't do that, all the comments would always be talked about and how frustrating that was not to hear their feedback, their personal kind of beliefs about the project and how they think it went. They always skirted around that, even when kind of pushed. No one would ever say anything, so I think that was quite demoralizing as a team, not to hear that. Great. Ant's easy to get on with. As a team, we're all very different. All very [inaudible 00:37:39], their some real different characters. Like Graham, for example, he's a very, very different character than I. We got on very well. And you had , he's very, very different to all of us. We actually gelled very well. And Ant is very much like, he wants you to take control of your stuff and do it and him to add value where he can and I think that's really nice. He kind of empowers you to do stuff rather than take that away from you, so that worked really well. Really good, actually. Fun. We were able to crack jokes and make each other laugh under the most extreme pressure and tension. I think, when you can do that, you've really nailed a good project team. When it can be quite, people are really working on [inaudible 00:38:37] and when we can do that, then that was really good. So I think that was probably the highlight of the project team, actually. Actually, on the way to Korea two weeks ago, we were all quite nervous about doing the presentation and we just had an e-mail sent through from someone over in the states and we'd all found it quite funny and humorous and we'd all be making internal jokes about it and that was the one thing that I think kept us going throughout that week of the presentation. We all just kept cracking the same old jokes. I think that worked. That was really important for keeping the team going, having a good laugh. `Okay, if you had this kind of remote control or this kind of TV interface, how would that change the way you behaved?` So, we started to use it for early on, sparking big thoughts, rather than coming up with those once we've seen people, so That was like, for that project, really quite empowering, actually. It was really quite nice, considering the discussions that had been going on internally about how to start reframing this HF phase and getting out of that and reframing it as design research instead. Yeah, yeah. People are being so sensible now, I hear. But then you always have to [inaudible 00:14:23]. I was speaking to Paul Bennett when I first got here and said, `It's very different, like you haven't got your nutters. Eight weeks in when they started to pick our cracks in communication between them and thinking, `This is not quite running as smoothly.` We're not ready to do that, we don't want to do that.` So, our big ideas started being pinched and we had to reframe how we were thinking things because of that.
