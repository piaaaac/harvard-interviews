Text: Last one. We did a project for a Chinese local company. Actually, I think we just spend some money hire Ideo do some design, but actually the clients don't know what's design. The last one is ... yeah, we try to teach our clients what Ideo's process is, but very hard. I think they don't have design knowledge, like they just know what's design. They probably ... they just want to see the good picture, like good rendering. They don't care about the story, what's the story behind the [inaudible 00:09:43], they didn't care. They also don't care HF. They just care good looking. But sometime, we just start the idea phase one right? Expectation is very high. Sometimes they can't imagine, so it's very hard. We don't know what's client exactly want. Yeah. We just try to go to his head. Yeah. It's quite less. Yeah. It's quite less, because whole project not a lot of money, so sometimes we just save time, don't work too long. Yeah. Because clients quite trust Ideo, because Ideo is quite good company. I think just don't want what we want, right? They don't know what they want, so make it finally what we did is ... it's his expectation. Me and the team member? We are work very good, also work very hard. We sketch together, discuss together, some just make joke, and make environment very relaxed. Actually, we work very well. The last one is ... yeah, we try to teach our clients what Ideal's process is, but very hard. I think they don't have design knowledge, like they just know what's design. They probably ... they just want to see the good picture, like good rendering. They don't care about the story, what's the story behind the [inaudible 00:09:43], they didn't care. They also don't care HF. They just care good looking. But sometime, we just start the idea phase one right? I think it's get some input from the team member. He said, `Okay, maybe we just up lot of meeting after meeting, we will decide, maybe these two is good for the clients.` But in that time, we not really understand what's the client's need. We just think that's good design for the design perspective, not for client's mind. Maybe some decisions wrong. Yeah. In Ideal not now, because I just join Ideal five months ago. I think now we did this project, I think seems things quite fit very well, because I joined HF phase, also discuss with HF people. We get very strong design direction. I think I also very agree also the direction more easy can get some idea. Sometimes from HF, direction from design is difficult, very difficult to create the design can fit this direction, more ... I don't know how should I say. Let's not talk about design sometimes direction. Yeah. But this time, I think it's good. Yeah. This project.   Last one. We did a project for a Chinese local company. Actually, I think we just spend some money hire Ideal do some design, but actually the clients don't know what's design. We create some good idea, but we don't use very, very good way to explain our ideas, just sketch, just very rough, 'cause client's can't understand. Yeah. Also, I think another thing is clients already spend a lot of money, so they're ... how to say?
