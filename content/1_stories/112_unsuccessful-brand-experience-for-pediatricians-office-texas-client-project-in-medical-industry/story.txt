Text: I was fairly new here. I don't know if that matters. The briefing was kind of unclear. It was all about the client being fairly large already and what they knew was that they needed to innovate and they had all these different offices. They gave us this open brief what should we do. The reason why ... I think there are several reasons why it was a negative experience for me. First of all, I didn't have a lot of experience in designing spaces. I was new to that discipline. I hadn't worked with the team before, those people. I was fairly new here. I don't know if that matters. The briefing was kind of unclear. It was all about the client being fairly large already and what they knew was that they needed to innovate and they had all these different offices. They gave us this open brief what should we do. Then, I think, we also had different ideas of what the result should be. We had different opinions about how to approach it. There was a lot of misalignment. Ideally in the beginning you try to talk about all the expectations and what you would like to learn and where you might be uncomfortable and so on. We didn't because we weren't all together before it actually started, it just didn't happen. We usually call that the internal kickoff. We didn't do that.

Two team members, they worked really well together. I didn't work well with them or the other way around. It went on for ... We never addressed it really. I addressed it once and then they said there's no real problem. But anyway. The whole teamwork didn't really work out. Two team members, they worked really well together.

I should've said we need to stop and talk. We can't go on like this. I should've really put my foot down. I think it was just the collaboration. There was no collaboration really happening. Yeah. They worked on different things. We did not agree on what we were driving towards too. The client wouldn't say either really. There's the idea that you just need to let IDEO go and they will come up with something. I was more interested in a discussion with a client and asking them would this make more sense or this make more sense. The other team members said no, no, we're just gonna propose what we should do. Yeah. A lot of misalignment and also different visions of what the product should be. Yeah. They worked on different things. We did not agree on what we were driving towards too.

It never really got to be defined this way or the other way really. Yeah. Yeah. I can't even remember what I said for the first one with inspiration. The user- centeredness. See, I don't know. That's part of the problems. I don't know In a way, yeah. You could say there was physical spaces. Then there was ideas for services. Then there were ideas for the workforce, like HR ideas. It was maybe three different areas. They were overlapping or related, but they were different ... I don't think you can compare them. They were just different topics. The client was basically one person and she was very appreciative and open. She had a lot of respect and appreciated us, but I didn't have ... Although I was project leading this ... Well, I wasn't really project leading it, but someone else had more contact with her than I did. he briefing was kind of unclear.

It was spatial but also organizational like HR-related stuff and service. Those types of services. Yeah. The idea was to make this a less medical experience. I don't know. I think the idea I had, which I don't think really made it into the design, was to bring some persons of nature inside of the building to make it feel more pleasant. The inspiration would have been nature, maybe. It's really hard to say. There were different approaches or different areas were explored.
