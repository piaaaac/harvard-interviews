Title: Emotionally really quite difficult

----

Text: One of the jobs that I do is, I'm the founder and manager of a food community charity called Moo Food up in the Highlands. And we sort of switched our role during COVID. What we do is we've got an edible village, with orchards and growing boxes and it’s filled with food all year to try and give people in the village access to seasonal food. And we've also got a community fridge at the heart of that for as a platform for sharing surplus food. We changed it during lockdown to start providing emergency food parcels and this is sort of stuck with me - the heart ache that brought. The budget that I found myself having to buy scores of people food was the same amount of budget I had for the month to feed five people. I knew I was in a very fortunate position in life that I can afford to feed myself and my family good food. But it sort of brought it home. The reality that what I was using one small budget to feed five people, I was using that to feed scores of people. And that was that's been emotionally really quite difficult… it's really, really heart-breaking. Also with these emergency food parcels, there was a mad sort of burst of demand in March and April, and it sort of balanced off and died down. But then there's still lots of people that are still coming twice a week to get emergency food parcels. And it's not because of COVID that they're there, it’s this wider chronic situation and people were in need of these parcels long before in COVID.
