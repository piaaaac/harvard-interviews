Text: We just had a really bad relationship with the client side. They didn't seem to mind the creative so much. It seems like things would get filtered down from upstairs that would just - just came down as just incredibly rude. And so you'd be like `Whoa, why are you talking to me like this?` And then sort of go back out and, sort of just silly things like - it didn't turn out to be about the creative. It was like, carrot sandwiches in meetings and just stupid stuff going on, and it's like `I just don't have time for this.` So. I mean, there's always disappointment. I think when we first started working on HSBC, that was one that we really really liked to push a lot further. 'Cause again, it's a cool brand. It's a big brand. There's lots of money, but somehow it always ends up - we just end up doing shit just because - it just - I mean, work comes from client but I don't what that country's service or client or whatever. But it just gets sorted down as kind of boring and there's so many mandatories. And there's so many things that you have to do that, there's just very little scope to go anywhere. But it just became really boring. We had this cool idea of covering bus shelters so they looked like houses and the inside of houses, but it just got forced down, forced down because they were worried that no one would get it. So in the end, it just became so basic that all the enjoyment was lost. All creativity. I don't know. We never met the client. So, that was a weird thing. Well we wanted to do something different. We sort of, had full use of any medium that we wanted so that shelter seemed like a really cool idea. And it would have been. But, yeah. Yeah, apparently. Yeah. We didn't actually really get very much feedback at all. Get this kind of job done and move on to the next one.

Brief was okay, but I mean it's barely even like a brief when you get one of those ones cause it's just - it's full of mandatories. And even - I mean - I don't know, but again. It comes from client and account services really, a proposition that's just going to advertise out of homeland. Yeah. It's just, heartbreaking. (laughs) Well again, we don't really know them. We met them once in like, a radio station and they just came in and told us we needed to put tents in it with the other legally mandatory things so - that was all that we know of them. I don't know about the upstairs either and I can't say there's - I think, they have a sort of dodgy relationship with them, probably not the best. But it seemed to be buddy-buddy, we can get anything though for you kind of thing, so.   Things got tense on this one because again when things get filtered down through client and you hear them and it just doesn't quite sound right, you wonder how much is sort of getting translated before you hear what you have to do. So that's kind of annoying.
