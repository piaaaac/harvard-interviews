Text: Okay. All right, we just finished a Thrifty billboard stand which was a productive idea that myself and Adam were working on and it started off as a really loose, basic idea and we didn't actually think it had too many legs but then we pitched the guys and it kind of grew and grew and grew. And as far as it went well, because we did it on the fly. We took some chances and the chances came off and then on the day everything just fell together and it was one of those times where you did plan a lot but you also were very lucky at the same time. It just so happened that everything went click click click and it came out well. A very simple job that could have gone horrendously wrong but actually it worked really well. So that's one that went well. I think from my point of view, a common factor of things going well is being prepared as much as you can. You can never be prepared for anything but if you try and think of every [inaudible 00:03:24] reality, things are more likely to go well and things are more likely to grow out of that as opposed to not having any planning and trying to ... Yeah, if you just start out the day without any prep you're in trouble. But if you start with prep, you can still win and make things up on the go which I think is a big part of creativity where you get a lot of good result out of it. But having that background if I try this, this and this. I think that often results in a good outcome. My training might be different than these guys. I come from a product design training. It was always drilled into me that you do a lot before hand and think laterally about the problem as opposed to the outcome that you're trying to get your information. And I think that's, it's almost opposite to how advertising ideas tend to work whereas it's a very loose and unrestrained. For them, it was a minimal effect on if it didn't go well it wouldn't have been detrimental to their brand but if it did go well it would be a positive so they didn't have too much of risk at all. Well from what I can tell they let us do a lot of creative thinking outside the box which isn't defined by a strong brief as opposed to someone like Kellogg's is another big client who have a lot of research to back up all of our work and there's probably 10 times the decision makers sitting around a table trying to evaluate an idea. Like Thrifty, it's very fluid. We've got this idea, it fits with you, it's very fluid.

They were comfortable in leaving us to evaluate the situation. Having a laugh basically. It seemed like a fun, I think it was one of those relaxed conversations where an idea comes out and it's like, this seems like a good idea. It wasn't anymore than that really.

They were really good. Open, very creating environment. Very free flowing and not just this is my idea, ah we can do this better [inaudible 00:08:13].
