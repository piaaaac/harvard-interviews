Title: 183 SHANGHAI Unsuccessful Bertlesman (TV) Project in Media industry

Text: But, yeah, they were really keen for innovation. They were still quite on their ... what is possible. So, I think it was really hard to balance with this budget because the client only wanted to consider the amount of money, and I think having that kind of ... Each of these ideas has got to make forty million pounds profit. And the forty million pounds is because they own the Pop Idol franchise model. And that's what each series of Pop Idol makes. So, they wanted the next Pop Idol, basically, is what we've been asked to deliver. And not having that kind of ... Not getting support back from the client on why they weren't willing to consider it. And because of the time it was taking to get these concepts ready, the client couldn't' agree on which ones they wanted to take forward, that made it really hard to then help the clients understand. So, when I came on to do that kind of testing ... Though I hate the word testing because it sounds so quantitative ... Just kind of try to build the desirability case around the concepts. The client was still struggling with the decision of how they got the right ideas going forward. So, it was very hard. I didn't feel ... I came on ... Well, and what I was doing wasn't being articulated the right way, because there was so many other problems at that stage going on. Even though that's why they came to us. They were still again only focused on the numbers on the bottom of the business case than what they were. No, I think that was another one of the problems. It was kind of like come up with a consumer ... I think it was a consumer benefiting ... So, the whole thing was rather than coming up with how can this make money, it was meant to be based on consumer need, or consumer insight. With the idea that that would make things more- Because it's so based on kind of the trend or tipping points. So, I think it was just a really difficult process. Meg London, and I think everyone that touched the project ... A lot more cautious of how projects are [inaudible 00:06:48]. And everyone is now a lot more actively looking at the proposals before they go out the door, so that it doesn't happen again. Because of how we were delivering, we weren't delivering just a business case. We were spending more time on more what the interaction would be like for a consumer than they would ever consider. Kinda more what they needed. I think it's actually not what they wanted, sorry, it's not what they needed. It's what they thought they needed. I think well ... One person had been pulled off because people didn't think she was capable, and I got pulled in with a team of two other people to kinda help pull it all together. It was one of these kind of slightly- But with super amounts of hours and also trying to get the team to do some social stuff. So, just like taking the team out to really expensive restaurants for lunch. Just to try and ... And she did a great job of getting the team to bond, but the bond was bitching about how shit the project was; which kind of didn't really help. So, what she did ... It was very much like, `We're the crusaders, and we're driving through this pain, and we're gonna get to the end, and we can do it` kind of comradery. But the core team of three people that had been on since the beginning really really struggled to kinda stay motivated; including the project manager, and they were just looking for the end. And they completely detached themselves from everything else that was going on, I think, just to protect themselves. But also because everyone was good friends, and the consultants who brought in also people that were personal friends of senior people within the London office. It was a really bizarre kind of ... It felt you kinda just had to be careful what you're saying and who you're saying to, you couldn't just kind of let off steam and then get back in. You felt like you had to be careful. I think also because it felt like the rest of the office been kept out in the dark, and trying to make out to the rest of the office that everything was going smoothly. The other team that was working for the same client was getting all this praise about how great their project was at the same time, which kind of was like rubbing salt into an open wound. So, we then had a big ... everyone that had touched it in any shape or form had meetings with leadership, and we had kind of a big internal looking in on why it had gone wrong. And so, that's kinda had a huge influence on trying to change how we run projects. It's changed how we scope and who's involved in scoping. And it's had some changes on just kind of how people are brought in and how projects [inaudible 00:16:45] about, which I think is good. It's like `Yeah, we brought this many people in.` And it was done in a really bad way. It was like, `Oh, we're taking this person off. We're not gonna tell any one why we've taken this person off, or why this person is now sitting in the office not working on his project.` No one in the rest of the company was told; like the rest of the London office, was told why she was off, and now me and another HF were now working on the project, and then why someone else was brought in to work on the budget. And it was like everything in [inaudible 00:13:11] in the office to the rest of the world that this project was going tits-up. But no one really wanted to talk about it. So, there were elements that needed a lot more thinking, and I think the client was expecting to be a lot more polished and concrete, which just wasn't possible during the time. So, it was both time constraints that way actually with kind of ... the client wanted ... I think the client needed it to be delivered to a higher level. So, when I joined towards the end, the team was just exhausted from trying to fight for what they thought was the right solution. But also just being told 'no', and never being told why. So ... But it then turned out actually that's why he's in the position he's in, because his hand has been held. He was the son of someone up in the [inaudible 00:08:26] there. So, it was really hard to kind of get the negativeness out of the team and get the team believing in the project again. I felt the client confirmed all my preconceptions about people that work in the media industry. In that they act as if everything is fine when you're in the meeting, and they were really happy with you and they loved you, and that `Yeah, we're really great friends.` And they'd get home and you'd get an email and they'd bitch. Or you'd get an email from someone else- It was a big ... The team really struggled early on in trying to find opportunity areas in something quite so vague; trying to understand the whole European entertainment industry. Yeah, I think ... Yeah, it did seem normal, but I think because of the clients, and the difficulties with the clients, they made it a lot harder to actually manage. Because the project manager ended up having to lead their project manager by the hand to get him to do what he should have been doing normally. They wanted something groundbreaking, but they weren't particularly good at articulating why they felt ideas didn't work. They'd go, `Oh, it didn't work.` And they would never consider that actually something can be done the right way. It was always, `Eh, we tried to think around that.` And it could be completely different concepts, or someone else tried doing it and it didn't work. And they were never kind of very good at saying, `Let's look at why this didn't work and learn from that.` It was very much, `That didn't work.` The business factors guy was, again, another consultant who's a not a 'how can we'. It was very much a 'you can't' rather than 'you could', which made it really hard to build on ideas. And that really kind of drove devising lines between the team. So yeah, the team ... that bit was the hardest. I think when they said 'next', they expected a whole new idea; a whole new kind of Pop Idol type concept to just appear from nowhere. And I think also for the team, not having ever worked in this industry as well, they found it really hard to keep coming up with these new ideas when they continually being told, `Oh, it's been done already.` But I think the thing was is that no one felt like ... It was really hard to relate the ideas back to the insight. And once there were threads that'd been snapped and broken and [inaudible 00:09:19] so it was ... I think that was the hardest thing is no one set their standards really high on what they wanted to deliver. And no one really felt that ... that had the time to actually deliver to the right level. And I think the client also was sightly expecting after to deliver to a level that was higher than was possible in the time. And I think we hadn't managed that expectation as well as we coulda done. -that they'd bitched to. So we never got ... It was actually never really directly from them; we'd always hear stories from other directions and the people we knew within the client about ... And we'd kinda have to try and patchwork all this together. There was ... Never came across very nice, we never really got ... Nothing was concise or anything. And so I don't think ... Because the client didn't understand the process we were using to test them and how well they work, because we use them regularly, they then weren't such believers. But I think, also, they really struggled with actually leading the desirability. But I think the one thing that did happen was as this project finished, we kind of ... A few of us kind of had a conversation with some of the senior leadership, and we made it very open that this project had been shit. When I say forced, it was more people really kind of ... You could never trust what someone was saying. You really had to think what's behind this and why they said it. So, rather than coming up with what they thought was a good idea and then working out ways it could be done, they had to see the business case before they could believe in the idea. I think that made things really hard for the team, because it's really hard to come up with a really cool creative idea when you kind of ... How can we make money, it's kinda being thrown ... Like, we don't know how it's gonna work; if it's desirable, and you're trying to ... And because of the time it was taking to get these concepts ready, the client couldn't' agree on which ones they wanted to take forward, that made it really hard to then help the clients understand.   I think that's what the team really struggled with because they ... I don't think the team felt that what they delivered was inspired by anything. They just felt it was just delivered. And I think the team went ... I think the team set themselves ... I felt I was kinda like a [inaudible 00:08:54] member that kind of touched the team but never was really part of the team. Although I probably was for the last four or five weeks of a sixteen week project.
