Title: 199 JOHANNESBURG Unsuccessful Cadbury Tempo Project in Confectionery/sweets/gum industry

----

Text: Okay there was one, it was Cadbury Tempo, which we did a TV ad for. It didn't go well from client side but according to research, everyone loved it ... ... So, it's a bit confusing. Okay so we just had to do a TV ad. Tempo hadn't advertised in years and the last ad that they had done was this jean ad and it was just like break dancing re-make thing and so they needed something a little more modern so we came up with a concept. The client then changed the concept within the same execution. So the client was quite difficult and yeah, eventually we got to make it and editing was an issue. And then, like I said, they didn't like the end results and it went out 'cause there wasn't anymore time and apparently the audience liked it so ... Relatively. I think we were about 80% happy with it. Because of limited budget as well, we couldn't get the directors and things that we wanted. So you limited to a certain type of director who ... They're not always as creative or as, he wasn't young either. He was sort of probably middle aged. So it was quite hard to try and give him the whole vibe and how to [inaudible 00:11:36] and the kinda people we talking to. We talking to 16 - 24 year olds, so it's quite young. Three young people, one ... And I don't know what their positions are. Five. Five people, yeah. They were willing to do it in the beginning and they were happy with the idea, obviously, then further down the line they ... I think was starting to have doubts. Yeah, we had decent-ish but just like I said, I mean a thing like that could've used more money. They had about one and a half. I think some of the quotes came in at 2 million which ... Yeah, so, it was okay. Good in the beginning, not so good at the end. See. the way that they work is that the three younger people would come in to the first briefings and they would be great, they would love the ideas. And they would then later on, the main guy would come in and he would wreck the whole thing and we'd have already gone so far down the line and then he would come in and he'd have an opinion and totally just change everything. So, with the younger ones, it's always been good. With him, it's always been difficult, he's always been cynical, is the word, about what we've been doing. Strategy actually played quite a big role in that one. We sat a lot with strats and to come up with ideas, actual executions because most chocolates and stuff like that don't really have anything to sell. They're not always as creative or as, he wasn't young either. He was sort of probably middle aged. So it was quite hard to try and give him the whole vibe and how to [inaudible 00:11:36] and the kinda people we talking to. We talking to 16 - 24 year olds, so it's quite young. Yeah, I think because it was quite technical. It was quite a technical ad and they're quite used to doing like 'sweet stories' because Cadbury's always been lovey and happiness and this was something really different so ... With him, it's always been difficult, he's always been cynical, is the word, about what we've been doing.   Yeah, you see, apparently on his side, his thing was, `Just make me famous.` He wanted ads that just made his name like really huge 'cause he came from SAB, just huge and so, I think there was a bit of ego involved on that side, and there was politics in the company because I think they wanted to move to another agency, so there was all these factors influencing all this whole and here we are trying to do a TV ad.
