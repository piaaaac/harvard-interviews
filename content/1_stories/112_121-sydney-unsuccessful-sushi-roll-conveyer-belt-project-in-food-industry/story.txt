Title: 121 SYDNEY Unsuccessful Sushi roll conveyer belt Project in Food industry

----

Text: It was just a medium that's never really been used before in Australia so everything from sourcing supplies ... there was only one supplier at the time who could wrap a handrail and they were in a phase where they were sort of experimenting with stock and with printing techniques and all that sort of stuff. There was no money involved. There was no real budget. Again, it was a proactive idea so it was just trying to pull a lot of favors, getting people to buy into the idea, love it, and then sort of ... We were lucky because they were just starting up their own company, the escalator people, and they were willing to kind of cover the costs. We wanted to do it first down here and we just were on a deadline and they couldn't commit. Then we had problems with one of the people, like the client didn't really want to put any money behind it. We shot the food all ourselves. There were so many delays with the actual owners of the shopping center. We wanted to do it first down here and we just were on a deadline and they couldn't commit. And then we went from this shopping center to the next shopping center and back again and then back to another shopping center. And we had to find a place that needed to be one of the conveyor belt ones, otherwise it wouldn't have made sense. Then we had problems with one of the people, like the client didn't really want to put any money behind it So it was just a really, really lengthy process. And then when they first installed it, it was actually, this stop lasted for about a day and then started peeling off. So they had to de-install the whole thing, put it up again three or four weeks later. Then the print was just kind of skewed and all distorted. So there were just so many little headaches we had with this. Because it was also a new medium, it was just, you can't really rely on experience or anything, it'd never been done before so it was just prototype thing. These are just the things that go wrong. Yeah, just a lot of headaches and a long, laborious process. They didn't do really ... it's hard to ... I'm not sure risk tolerance is the right word. They just ... because it was something new, they couldn't really imagine what it would end up looking like. They were a little wary, so I don't know. They were a little skeptical but when they saw the idea, they said okay, go for it, which was great. Because we went through a lot of companies. We were actually looking for a client. Because they were down in World's Square, we just sort of struck a relationship with them and found out who the market manager was and then kind of talked to him. There were a few other ones on the radar but it just ended up being this one because they had just enough, they were kind of big enough which gave us the option to go to different locations if we weren't able to get the escalator handrail media up and running, so we were able to go somewhere. Which essentially is exactly what happened. We planned it for World's Square but the World's Square management board didn't want commit. They said, it's on the radar but it could be weeks and months down the track. We wanted to get it up and running before Christmas. That never happened. First one was a bit rocky. Communication was really, really difficult. Their command of the English language was a bit limited at best. And they weren't really forthcoming with supporting us financially. They were willing to give us a little bit of money but it was a drop in ocean, it was nothing. So yeah, it was really, really hard at first and then we kind of got another client. Same company but a different person, a manager of the other branch, who was a lot better. But overall, it wasn't easy. The language barriers, I think. it was just, you can't really rely on experience or anything, it'd never been done before so it was just prototype thing. These are just the things that go wrong. Yeah, just a lot of headaches and a long, laborious process. Yeah.   hey were a little wary, so I don't know. They were a little skeptical but when they saw the idea, they said okay, go for it, which was great. First one was a bit rocky. Communication was really, really difficult. Their command of the English language was a bit limited at best.
