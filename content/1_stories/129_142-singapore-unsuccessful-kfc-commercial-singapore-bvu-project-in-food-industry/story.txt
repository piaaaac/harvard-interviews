Title: 142 SINGAPORE Unsuccessful KFC commercial (Singapore - BVU) Project in Food industry

----

Text: There was a funny episode a long time back. There was this commercial case we were doing. It was, they have too many restrictions. The thought was we had this family going to the KFC and the order, and then the kid looks up and he sees the mall Santa sitting outside eating by himself. So the kid feels sad and tugs at his dad's shirt. And the next shot was Santa saying it's time for sharing. And the client said, `Santa doesn't eat.` `Santa doesn't eat.` So how do you argue that? How can we say back, you know? I say you're talking about disappointing stuff. Like this commercial for KFC, right? We had this, it was for Christmas season thing. We had this, it had a lot of restrictions. You had to have 15 seconds of the ad and two seconds on the chicken or whatever it is. In that first half you gotta tell the story if there is a story at all. So we had this, thought we'd make it a bit cute. We had this family going into this KFC restaurant. Then as they're ordering the kid looks up and there's a mall Santa sitting outside eating by himself. Most of the cases have a mall here. And the kid tugs at his dad's shirt. The next shot is you have Santa sharing the meal with him. It's about Christmas and spreading the cheer, sharing. So when we would explain that to the client, she said, `But Santa doesn't eat.` So they didn't buy the commercial because they thought Santa didn't eat. Which was a bit, very odd. It's the, it's like you have a bunch of people, let's say six guys. There's one person that's gonna say yes or now. And once the person says something everybody will say yeah yeah yeah, he's a charming guy, he's like Gandhi. Or whatever they say, they're just reflect. They won't change their mind or disagree with him. It's always quick turnaround, two days. Yeah, with KFC it was always insanely tight. I don't know. They seemed ... I think because of somebody turning up late, she was a bit pissed off. Maybe not very cordial at that. I said they're stupid. A bit dense, yeah. No I guess the client was a bit difficult too because of the nature of the function of the business leg. Retail has to be very quick. Very conservative, I would say.   So I guess it's a mixture of everything. The planning, a bit too much on the defensive side. So it's been about pain, and the tactic line all coming together.
