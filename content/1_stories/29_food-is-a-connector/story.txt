Title: Food is a connector

----

Text: Covid-19 and its impact should be a wake-up call. The term ‘build back better’ has been coined as a phrase in the recovery phase of Covid-19. We must centralise this approach and use this opportunity to reshape our future food system and not return to a normality, that includes unacceptable levels of food insecurity, social isolation and malnutrition, amongst older people. Centralising the social value of food and recognising it’s direct connection to social risk-factors and link to wider health priorities, is key, if we are to ‘build back better’ and create a Scotland that prioritises “ensuring people are healthy, happy and secure in older age” and in the process ensure the preventable issues of malnutrition and social isolation are not prolific to the ageing experience in Scotland. Moving forward, cross-sectoral reflection and ‘joined-up’ conversation, learning, and action is key. The Covid-19 response has emphasised how crucial community-based solutions are; and how grassroot investment can result in an effective, individualised response, that understands its community. If we are to deliver radical change that recognises that- food is a tool, food is a connector and food is social, community, grassroots approaches and the third sector must be at the heart of this.
