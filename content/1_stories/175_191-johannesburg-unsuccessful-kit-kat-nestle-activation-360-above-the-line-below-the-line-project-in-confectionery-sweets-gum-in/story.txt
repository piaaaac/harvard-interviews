Text: Because it started off as a really big - like, campaign that could have sold a lot of product for them and then it's kind of been watered down to a campaign that's not really going to do anything, we don't think. That's basically it. Client got a presentation from another guy who was bringing in the cell phone air time, like thing so if you sent to a unique code you'd get airtime back from them. And this guy presented the idea to client, client loved that idea and when we tried to incorporate it into our bigger idea they basically said they don't want the bigger idea they just want the air time thing and it was very limited and very, like narrow minded. Yeah, we presented the idea - the big idea to them and they liked it and they thought it was cool and everything involved. And then later on they came back and said `No, we want to just have this one element in it and that's it.` We still have to sell four million bars, and. It was pretty involved. Pretty daunting because they wanted us to sell eight billion bars this year, which is pretty crazy. So it was really like, we had high expectations there to meet and we could've met them but I don't think we will now. No. The budget was too little for what they wanted. Time was pretty tight. No, we went in with above, like what money they had and they know they'd have to choose which elements they wanted or didn't want to make the budget like that. Obviously we just, we butted heads on the fact that they wanted to cap our, like three quarters of the campaign that we had thought of. So we spent a lot of time on it that they weren't going to run. They basically just felt that they had the money and they wanted to do what they wanted to do. Client service was cool and we already knew client service - the brand unit director, business unit director were kind of onboard halfway through the project so - obviously they aired more towards the client side because they're trying to make the relationships with the client and stuff so we had a bit of, not seeing eye to eye. But generally, it was fine. like narrow minded. And this guy presented the idea to client, client loved that idea and when we tried to incorporate it into our bigger idea they basically said they don't want the bigger idea they just want the air time thing and it was very limited and very, like narrow minded.   I think a lot of financial decision and some preference and maybe not really understanding the problem at hand. Yeah. I mean the relationship with Kit-Kat hasn't been the best for awhile anyway. So, there's always a bit of tension there.
