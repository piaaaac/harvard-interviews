Title: Unsuccessful Kit Kat TVC (Russian Kit Kat people) Project in Confectionery/sweets/gum industry

Text: There were many projects like that, but again, it depends on what we mean by didn't go well. Let's say, I had an experience when we had a brilliant idea, but, it was very difficult to sell it to the client here. We managed to sell it with the help of our London office. But later on when the person, the key person from the London office went back home, it all was redone, and what we went with finally, was something, to me it's rubbish actually. Well, it has some strong points, but still, it's something very, very average. The other issue is that, he was friends with the marketing director, but that's all rubbish. The fact is, he sold it. So, he sold the idea that we created here and he liked it, and everybody liked it. I remember the creative director, our creative director, he had a very positive opinion about this idea. Again, this idea was generated by me and my art director, with whom by the way, I worked at Leo Burnett. At that time, he was here with us. So, that London person- By that time, the London person went back home, and I don't know what exactly happened on the client's side, but what we finally heard, that the client refused going further on with that idea, and made us create something else. Sergei, whom you'll interview tomorrow, he created the idea, and he found a very strong visual element I would call it, within the idea. I think that was a very strong point of this idea. But overall, I think the approach itself and the idea itself was weaker than what we sold before. But, the client went with that because they said, "Here is our target audience, it's quite important that we show our target audience the TV commercials, because otherwise, people will not understand the commercial is for them," and that kind of shit. It's an absolute crap really. Well, it's hard for me to judge, but I think it's the problem of most clients here. They believe that if they don't show a target audience within the commercial, then the target audience will not get it is for them. They will not relate to the commercial. The commercial that we- Yeah, Russian Kit Kat people, yeah. The commercial that we initially sold to them was like this, there were two burly men in a showroom, at a table with a lot of hoses and tights and that kind of stuff. So, they were now stretching those tights, and there was hoses and that kind of stuff. They looked at colors and patterns, and they discussed it between themselves, "Look, such beautiful flowers here. I like pink tights," that kind of stuff. Then, one of the men said, "Let's have a break," they had Kit Kat. Then, through the cut, we saw them robbing a bank, wearing those funny hoses. Yeah, that was really funny, that was quite, quite unusual for Russian advertising. What I personally liked about that is the sense of humor that was in. I don't think that advertising which makes people laugh is a bad one. I think it's a very, very positive feeling and you have very positive attitude towards reels with humor. So, that was the idea. The feedback we had from the client, eventually, we had from the client is that, there is no target audience, people will not relate to it, they will not understand it, it will not drive sales, and that kind of stuff. What they finally went with is a story. Well, there was actually three stories about young people. There was a girl who said, "You can get a mark at the exam for profound knowledge or for beautiful eyes." Well, there is an expression in the Russian language, beautiful eyes, which means for nothing, for the beautiful eyes. For the beautiful eyes, it's like an idiom, a play upon words. Then all of a sudden, it read Kit Kat on an armchair appeared in the room. She jumped on that, ate the bar, and then she said, Tomorrow, I'll wear a miniskirt." That's it. So to me, it's really flat, there is no humor in that.  The only strong element which I see here, strong in terms of branding, is the armchair, which was created by Sergei, and that was a strong point in the reel, but that's it. There is no humor, there is no touch, to me. Maybe to other people there is. But anyway, I think it's flat, to me it's flat. That's what we went eventually with. There were so many people I'll tell you. There were strategic people, creative people, I can't remember exactly. But, the team was really huge. It was about maybe seven people participating, and that was another problem, that we had so much discussion within the agency, what we should do and what we shouldn't do, that kind of stuff. Tiring, really tiring. Maybe, maybe. That's so funny. They sometimes tell us, "We went through the office asking our colleagues what they think about this video." I see those zombies and I can't imagine what they tell them, because they are abnormal people really. They're not consumers that watch TV. They're so far away from that, really. I would say half of those people participated in the process. There was one person or maybe two, from the creatives, one person from the strategic department, and one person from the account department. That's a very rough breakdown, so it's not exact. Yes, the creative director participated in that. He was actually very happy and very positive about the first idea that was sold to the client. I'm afraid they did not test it, I'm afraid they did not test it because they ... By the way, I'm afraid that the year that we sold that idea, they did not have any tests. I remember them having tests one year after that, when we worked on the U Campaign, but by that time, I was not participating at this riveting activity. Yeah, yeah. Well, it might have worked against us as well. My attitude towards test is, it's a very, very cunning thing, very cunning thing, especially because they're quite flat. They don't go deep down, they don't use some techniques that they should use and should think about creating, inventing those techniques. Yeah, of course. It's just to hide yourself behind the papers, "I have the research results." Absolutely, that's so incredible. The worst thing is that it was just after I came here. So, I came here and I had that project. I was so depressed. Really, I thought I would quit, I would quit straight away. So, I started calling to HR people saying, "Probably, it's not the place I want to work with." Again, we sat and drank with my art director, I can't remember anything in particular. Just thinking in a more or less relaxed way, if you know what I mean. It's not that we disregarded the deadlines, it's just that we don't create inner stress within the team. No, no, no, not exactly. That was probably one of the occasions, and I have enough fingers on one of my hands to name those occasions when our network really helped us a lot. It was not like we had a clash with them or we had a misunderstanding with them, it was really a hard period we went through with them, because we had so much shit from them, really, absolutely biased one. But still, the person who came, he did the key thing that people here could not do. They could not sell their idea to the client, he managed to do that. "Here is our target audience, it's quite important that we show our target audience the TV commercials, because otherwise, people will not understand the commercial is for them," and that kind of shit. It's an absolute crap really. They can't stand any risk really. It's better to stick to something very flat, which will give them 1% of sales. Otherwise, what if they drop sales by 10%? They will all get fired. That's crazy. Can you imagine? People that say everything is crap, for almost two years.
