Title: Unsuccessful Stouffers/Nestle Project in Food industry

----

Text: It's interesting to compare the two, because Stouffer's should be as clear-cut and defined as Lean Cuisine, but it's this group that we work with on theirs is brutal. It basically comes down to showing her executions as opposed to getting her to buy off on a concept first. It's the polar opposite of how the Unilever guys are able to understand a big picture concept, and then let the work be created. And on Stouffer's, she thinks she gets the big picture concept, but then she can't buy off on it until she sees it actually executed. So she gets caught up in executional details and it just wastes so much time and energy. And it ends up being something that is just really watered down and not that interesting. And then it doesn't perform very well. That happens on everything we do for them We have a client who thinks she knows what she wants to see, but she's unable to verbalize it. So it's kind of like a cat and mouse game, and it just ends up eating so much ... It basically comes down to showing her executions as opposed to getting her to buy off on a concept first.

Too much input. Oh, very low. They test everything. They go to almost finished commercial quality and put it into ... I forget what their format is now, or what the testing company is, but it's a Bordamatic-type situation. Yes. The brief itself never changed, but their interpretation of it changed every meeting. Oh my God, probably 20? Oh, it was brutal. Stouffer's was really hard, because of this woman's inability to make decisions. So while she would say she really wanted us to push her and give her strong recommendations, she didn't really want that, because she always thought she had in her head what it was she was looking for but she couldn't verbalize it. So that gets really uncomfortable after a while, when you don't finally come to a solution together and have some relief from that. So that constant friction really destroys a relationship after a while, which is what just happened, really. The team here was amazing. Actually, who you're gonna meet, Jeff ... It was he and I, basically the team on it. And we just adore each other and work really well together, and we just did the best we could. Luckily we had each other to keep us from killing ourselves.

Well, we actually just lost them. They're moving to the New York office, because the relationship has just finally gotten so ... It's just brutal. It's like working with a boyfriend you broke up with. So the person that's supposed to have the final say, she's the one that has so much trouble. She ends up bringing a lot of different people in to get their input. It's all so clear to me now, why it's such a nightmare. It's like, "Duh!"

Time always became a factor, because the decisions couldn't be made in time.  Stouffer's was really hard, because of this woman's inability to make decisions.
