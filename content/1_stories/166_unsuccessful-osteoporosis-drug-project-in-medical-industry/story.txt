Title: Unsuccessful Osteoporosis drug Project in Medical industry

Text: Okay. I guess the first one that comes to mind. This is just very personal though. It was my first project. So, I started here basically, I started straight out of school, like I had done some freelance work and some other projects as a student and with like a professor but, I started here and I kind of like got plopped into the middle of a project with somebody who was also new here. But she had been a project manager at another great design firm. She was like very controlling. And I had a researcher I was working with and she was very harsh. And I've learned after I started that she was somebody who was not that stoked about me getting hired. But she had been a project manager at another great design firm. She was like very controlling.

Like I was kind of told you have to do this this way and it wasn't like the way that I would do it. So I wasn't that good at it. So it was frustrating. And I didn't know how assertive to be about that. I kind of tried and [crosstalk 00:33:51]. I kind of was just like put to work to do kind of like the manual labor part, which was fine, but it felt like I didn't get to contribute in the ways that I wanted to. Like I was kind of told you have to do this this way and it wasn't like the way that I would do it. So I wasn't that good at it. So it was frustrating. And I didn't know how assertive to be about that. I kind of tried and [crosstalk 00:33:51]. You know I didn't participate in it as much but I could see the interactions with the client were just kind of difficult. She was somebody kind of at a mid tier in this ginormous company. So, I don't know exactly because I was like a little bit on the outside of it which was frustrating for me, but I knew that there were communications problems between you know what she wanted, how she wanted it delivered, and us just being able to do our work and what we thought was appropriate. There's always so much work to do that, its like, how much are we going to argue about this versus just like going, fine, we're just going - we need to get it done because I don't want to be here all weekend either. So, like we came up with all these concepts and we made like a bazillion models. I was at the shop making blister packs by hand, you know the prototype. And we use them in the field with people which is really cool actually. But we came back and it was like, this doesn't make sense. Like some of the premise of what the drug was going to be and their idea like didn't make sense and we told them that. And they kind of didn't care. They wanted this one solution which didn't do well, which users didn't like or really get and they thought was wasteful. They were like, no, no, no we like it. I think it was this woman who was the team leader on the client's side and her boss. Her boss was like, you know, Joey likes this one - They were like, no, no, no we like it.

I think it was this woman who was the team leader on the client's side and her boss. So we need to like fix that to make it better. Which was like, you know, not the way we ideally want to work. But we might have ... but it would have been like at our mid phase or final meeting where we're in this meeting room on their campus on their corporate campus and there were like 50 people that came to the meeting. And you know it was set up like an audience with like risers and these sort of desks and like the projection and you know that my two other Senior teammates presenting. And then these people in the back would just be like, well, you know, blah blah blah and they get into some technical jargon that's not even related to this drug or something else. Like they were so uninvolved in the process and uninvested in our work that obviously its going to fail. Like why are you even have people like that in a meeting if their not close enough to it or no interested in what we're contributing, you know, it doesn't make sense. There was our main client contact, so I would say, but we thought she was the decision maker but then I think the way the project sort of unraveled at the end, that there were probably more that we were necessarily well connected to. I mean, by the nature of the company, I'd say that their risk tolerance wasn't very high, but the ideas that they fell in love with were probably more risky than what we were recommending. They were just kind of like, oh this will be cool. It was silly, you know. So, I don't know, just medium. I mean they weren't particularly risky but they weren't afraid of anything we were proposing either They were just kind of like, oh this will be cool. It was silly, you know. We learned a lot about what it means to be an elderly single woman with osteoporosis and like how difficult it can be to remember to take all your medication and to go through special rituals for each kind of medication is really difficult. So just from a lot of their needs and struggles and aspirations too. I mean how much people who are ... you know its not like people with osteoporosis are deathly ill or anything, but just having chronic conditions just kind of wears you down. So seeing like what measures people take to be inspired or to feel okay about it or to remind themselves everyday that life is good and its not that big of a deal. So that was all inspiring to just think about like how can medication not be this like problematic thing that's a burden in your life. But she had been a project manager at another great design firm. She was like very controlling. And I had a researcher I was working with and she was very harsh. And I've learned after I started that she was somebody who was not that stoked about me getting hired. So I got put on a project with these two people who didn't have the best faith in me and it was just the three of us, and I kind of just felt like I had two bosses. And I was expected to do things in a certain way, which I've since learned is not really that typical at IDO, it was just a really bad way to get in the door. So that was frustrating. The client was really hard. It was a big consumer goods pharmaceutical company and - o I got put on a project with these two people who didn't have the best faith in me and it was just the three of us, and I kind of just felt like I had two bosses.

Yeah, I think its ... we would hope that its more intentional than that, but the realty of it is that pretty much since I've been here, we've been in a resourcing crunch. So, I think its always hard to match people to projects and sometimes unfortunate combinations are made. Also, in the long run, we all have to be able to work together so if its going to be that big of an issue, then its not going to work out.
