Title: 53 CHICAGO Unsuccessful Geisinger Care Works start-up in-store medical clinics (GCW and pharma company) Project in Medical industry

Text: . One of the problems was that there were multiple conversations with multiple practices before the project ever got going, and so the client kind of, no matter what was in the actual final proposal, in their memory was all the things they had heard from everybody about what they were going to get. That was a problem. We were very poorly aligned with the client, so that was a lot of the problem. We didn't take steps even when it was clear that we were misaligned to just say, `Hey, let's get some alignment here.` What they thought they could get, and what we could deliver, or what was reasonable to deliver. Or where the focus should be, whether it was a whole bunch of things shallow, or one or two things deep, like alignment around issues like that. One of the problems was it was mostly one and there was a lot of disagreement about the decisions. So the internal team was very poorly ... had very bad interaction. Yeah. The project leader would make decisions that people disagreed with. Well, the client was really two clients trying to collaborate. Very different goals. Very different goals, where the guy who was the CEO of the existing clinics had very short term operational kinds of things that he was interested in, whereas the pharma company was really interested in this as a unique new touchpoint to see what that would mean for them in their business. There wasn't really the time or the budget to address both of them in depth that they would need to be explored in, and so it ended up being one of these things where there was a shallow view of everything taken that just wasn't satisfying to anybody. Very low. Always bad ingredient. You'll see that, I'll give you that one for free. You don't have to analyze your data for that. One of the problems was that we didn't even ... it was all over the place, and I think that we just didn't go back and revisit it enough. You know what I mean? t's a great example of how we're having growing pains in the work we're doing now. It's very different kinds of work and it requires very different kinds of project plans and things like that. It was basically treated like one of our old project development projects, and that's part of why it didn't work well. Time was fine. The budget was wrong That's why they were bad. We were just misaligned all the time they would do stuff like be made uncomfortable by something, and instead of directly having a conversation with us at the time they go away and write these very formal emails, which we don't respond well to. So things were just not above board and director talked about. People were struggling and they took it out on each other. I see this happening more and more here actually when people get uncomfortable instead of bonding together, because they're nervous they end up taking it out on each other.  It gets very, `If only X had done their job better we wouldn't be in this place,` it's that kind of thing, which is just so the complete opposite end of the spectrum from how it should be, or how we talk about how we do our work. Yeah, I just had one. One of the problems was that there were multiple conversations with multiple practices before the project ever got going, and so the client kind of, no matter what was in the actual final proposal, in their memory was all the things they had heard from everybody about what they were going to get. That was a problem. We were very poorly aligned with the client, so that was a lot of the problem. We didn't take steps even when it was clear that we were misaligned to just say, `Hey, let's get some alignment here.` Another problem with that was there were ... the client was the Ventures Group. Somebody in the Ventures Group who was in charge of this as a start-up business, and then they also had funding from one of the major pharma companies. So there were two very, very different things that each, that the pharma company and the CEO of the Ventures, of the actual existing clinics had. There was very different goals that they had from the engagement. Very different goals. Very different goals, where the guy who was the CEO of the existing clinics had very short term operational kinds of things that he was interested in, whereas the pharma company was really interested in this as a unique new touchpoint to see what that would mean for them in their business. Yeah. It was certainly too small for what really needed to get done. The budget was way too small for what needed to happen. It's a great example of how we're having growing pains in the work we're doing now. It's very different kinds of work and it requires very different kinds of project plans and things like that. It was basically treated like one of our old project development projects, and that's part of why it didn't work well. Like clients will do, they pushed for as much as they could get and there was serious scope creep and we didn't stop it. That's why they were bad. We were just misaligned all the time and they would do stuff like be made uncomfortable by something, and instead of directly having a conversation with us at the time they go away and write these very formal emails, which we don't respond well to. So things were just not above board and director talked about. People were struggling and they took it out on each other. I see this happening more and more here actually when people get uncomfortable instead of bonding together, because they're nervous they end up taking it out on each other. There was one particular team member who really did that, and then the other three team members, actually with each other, got along great.   When people feel uncomfortable and they feel like they're not getting to a good place work wise and they need to kind of like ... so they get testy, or they'll decide that there's a weak link on the team. It gets very, `If only X had done their job better we wouldn't be in this place,` it's that kind of thing, which is just so the complete opposite end of the spectrum from how it should be, or how we talk about how we do our work.
