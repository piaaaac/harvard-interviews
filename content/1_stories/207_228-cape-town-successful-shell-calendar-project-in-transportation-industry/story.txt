Title: 228 CAPE TOWN Successful Shell Calendar Project in Transportation industry

Text: Yeah. I look through a lot of design books and websites for inspiration but like not necessarily advertising but just anything creative can sort of spark off ideas. And also to get out and sit in the garden or walk down to the gardens. I like to do that. Every year somebody gets to do the calendar and it's more of a creative sort design piece. It just sort of ... it gave me a chance to grow quite a bit because I got to sort of source lots of props and do a shoot. It was just a great learning experience and I think it turned out really well cuz everyone was very impressed and very ooh wow the calendar. It's the best it's been and things like that. So, I figure that one went well. Although, I'm pretty harsh about my own work. I always look at it and I'm like, uh. I could have totally done way better on this and that. But anyway I think if we're talking about things going well that would be. I think it went well because I had more freedom from the client. Freedom as in I could still work within the boundaries, because I always feel like when they say freedom, it's actually a shitty, scary thing because that means that they haven't given you a proper brief. You know, it's always like uh this big open brief and then you don't know what to do. But if you have a good brief and you still ... and you can kind of express yourself within that nicely that's really cool and I think that they let me do that with the calendar. I got to just decide and design and come up with things and every time we sent it over they were just, like oh wow, great. This is amazing. So that was a lot of fun. I think that the one thing that I learned at college that always comes through is that one of my lecturers said, `The better the brief, the better the creative.` And we always go like no. Like masters. (whip sound). But it really matters. If people give you, shitty sort of [inaudible 00:09:39] weird briefs it makes it impossible. Zero or minus. It's really irritating because they keep asking for it and I get really irritated because Jim keeps saying to me, `Amy, I want you to push for amazing creative work.` And then I'm like, `Jim, I do.` But every time we show to clients they pick the safe one. We always get told come up with a really cool one and then ooh should we just put in a safe one and they always pick the shitty, safe one. It's quite soul destroying. The client absolutely loved it. I didn't go to the meeting but I heard that they were pretty much on the floor. Then they were like, look we love it but we're gonna go with the safe one, because I don't think anyone else will get this, but it was like you got it. Everyone who's seen it got it. But, hey we'll go with the safe one. That one would have been a lot of fun and the safe one was very pretty at least. I got to do a lot of my nice designing. I think. Yeah, I think it was fine. I think that's probably why it was a good one, because I actually got to do some work on it. And could afford the shoot and everything. It was fine. I guess it was really good, because they gave feedback that was sort of understandable. They said, `this chart looks a bit strange.` Or something like that and I could totally say, `Yeah, you know I can see that.` But often a client will give feedback where it's like, what. Where did that come from. So, I could kind of level with them on that. It was good. Really good, they were really supportive and loved it all the way through. That's why it was a good one. Global clients seem to think that we're just a repro house. They give us our ideas and they're like, look this is it and we've got to pretty much make it up from their shitty jpegs that they send us and it's really frustrating. Cuz it's like, okay well this is hideous. Often, when we have brainstorm sessions and things they don't really understand our markets as well as we do and it's quite frustrating. We know we could do a much better job. Also, It feels like they don't trust us because often they'll send us their little jpegs of the layout and we'll ask them for the open files because we have to reproduce this piece for South Africa and they'll kind of be like, oh we've been told not to give you the open files because you know we've got to keep the quality good. And we're like yeah, but we've been told by your client to work on it. So, how about handing it over. It's always quite restraining and it just feels like we're not really important when we do global stuff. Global clients seem to think that we're just a repro house. They give us our ideas and they're like, look this is it and we've got to pretty much make it up from their shitty jpegs that they send us and it's really frustrating.

It's always quite restraining and it just feels like we're not really important when we do global stuff I think, concept. I think if I went with that one that I initially came up with that it would have been a lot more impactful. This was a pretty calendar that was done nicely, but the other one had humor and ... Although, I'm pretty harsh about my own work. I always look at it and I'm like, uh. I could have totally done way better on this and that. I think it went well because I had more freedom from the client. I got to just decide and design and come up with things and every time we sent it over they were just, like oh wow, great. This is amazing. So that was a lot of fun. look, we want a stupid party and just come up with a theme for it instead of just come up with something amazing. It's an experience. And then we were like, yeah we came up with the most amazing stuff and then they were like well we just wanted to have kind of like bring a DJ over or something and we were like, you could have said that. And then I'm like, `Jim, I do.` But every time we show to clients they pick the safe one. We always get told come up with a really cool one and then ooh should we just put in a safe one and they always pick the shitty, safe one. It's quite soul destroying. it had all these kind of mountain climbing things and then we came up with a really cool idea for it which was this really stupid guy I didn't go to the meeting but I heard that they were pretty much on the floor. Then they were like, look we love it but we're gonna go with the safe one, because I don't think anyone else will get this, but it was like you got it. Everyone who's seen it got it.
