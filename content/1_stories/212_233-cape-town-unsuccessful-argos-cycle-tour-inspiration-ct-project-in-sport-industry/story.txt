Title: 233 CAPE TOWN Unsuccessful Argos Cycle Tour [Inspiration CT] Project in Sport industry

----

Text: I'm trying to think of ... nothing here at present, that I can comment on. But yeah like in the past, projects that don't go well I think are based on the money element, where people just give up good ideas to compensate for the fact that they're getting paid. Not having a, I think it's really important to have a, one figure, as like a token of strength you know. And so that you've got, if you've got an issue, or you need somebody to fight for what you actually do, you got one person to do it, that's willing to do it, and that's got enough confidence in you, confidence in themselves, to carry it forward. You know what I'm saying. Cause, as far as campaigns go, if your client ... So yeah, which was, the whole thing carried itself on the visual. It had to look like it was intense. And then the client said but we've got this picture of a guy throwing Coke over his head with a little cup. And we're like, it's not the same thing. And they're like, why? It is. And to have a creative director not stand up for the fact, that truly that is the guy clunking Coke on himself. And that was gonna say that this is the most intense race you've ever done? So I had to throw Coke in my face to make it worse. So yeah, I think it's key to have a backbone. My boss should have recycled her campaign. They actually did do a cheapy shoot to rectify the situation but it was no where off, like the mark where we were actually heading. Really embarrassing. Yeah, so. Yeah. I don't know, these [inaudible 00:21:52] rectify creative directors that don't have, like a backbone. You could have a creative director pouring Coke on his head, going “get a new job”. Massive gripe would be politics, internal politics in offices. It's like ... don't even come to work, it's pointless. It very much becomes like ... sure, we're doing the same thing every year. But none of them, if you had to put them up, they don't even look like it's under the same brand, if you know what I'm saying. If the logo wasn't there, you wouldn't be able to say that that is definitely Cycle Tour, pick and pay Cycle Tour. The consistency was in the treatment of the ad, which I don't think is where you're waiting should lie. You're waiting shouldn't lie in the treatment of the ad, it should be in the bigger idea. And I think it was very much compensating big ideas, for it to look like it sort of did last year. Pieces of the bike, the bike chain would make a mountain, or you know, those kinds of things. It never became like, a personal thing. I suppose the elements, their challenges, there are, as well would be the fact that limited for cash, limited for shooting. I think, as an agency we shouldn't see ourselves as people that come to work and sit behind computers. We should be seen as creative people, you should be interactive with creative people. So, get photographers in, let's look at people's portfolios, let's see how's good at doing this, and who's not so good at that. Get people who are sculptures, you know, don't be static in the ideas and development. Always kind of, focus. Like I always think to myself, the best way to start the day creatively would be just to stop and pick out the Communication Arts Annual and just check it out. Just gear your brain into new ways of thinking, or tackling something, and then carry on with your day. Don't just carry on with your day like you did yesterday, because it's just moves us into the same motion, the same way of thinking, the same ... yeah. He went to get his own idea. Because it had been running for so many years, and worked with them for so many years, let's just say that the relationship was good. I've seen them the clients to our agency on a social interactive level, and you know, generally seemed like good rapport. So yeah, I can't exactly say or not that ... We're so tired of each other. It was so funny because a new girl started, and she'd come to me and she'd ask me, “ Don't you just want to come around here and have a look at this type thing I've done at the bottom?` I'd go, `cool, no worries.` [inaudible 00:36:10] Oh yeah, that's really cool. Don't listen to me, because in therapy, what I say, Andre says the exact opposite of. So, she would go `oh, hahaha.` [inaudible 00:36:26] rest of the day. By the end of the day I saw a printer, I went, ` did you get rid of the box?` Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah, very much so. I think what is also very interesting is ... peoples perceptions of something. I think once you've created a perception ... how group dynamics also affect, that perception of you as a person. And, how politics as well can affect you. You, haven't changed how you do things, or too much of a degree. Just the simple way that the cards fall ... ends up being more important than the actual job getting done. So, you've just gotta go, “okay, I'm going to go do the job somewhere else.” I don't think that the work that's been generated was necessarily ... you know plaque top like, you know if I'm looking at to scale yeah, probably so ... maybe four. Very much on the four. And I think that the clients were happy with the relationships, but did have a tendency to go, oh but give us a little bit more. And yeah, I think very much sitting in like the safe zone, from all sides. So, it's touch and go. I think more team efforts. I definitely think that the team was lacking, the sense of we're in this together or we have the same goal, focused on it, I think ... You know a lot of things happened ... you know with the chiefs, and there was a lot of chiefs and the guys doing the work weren't really aware of it. I think if you're not really aware of your purpose you're not going to do it very like, with dedication, with motivation, it almost becomes like the puppet, whereas you're not really part of the play, you know. Coke over his head with a little cup. And we're like, it's not the same thing. And they're like, why? It is. And to have a creative director not stand up for the fact, that truly that is the guy clunking Coke on himself. My boss should have recycled her campaign. Yeah. Okay, I think another problem there is, that job has been done by the same agency for ... at least ... five years, I think that was probably the fifth year we've done the campaign and under the same creative director and the campaign's almost, tend to look the same. You've got logo, you've got when the date is, you've got sponsor logos, and you've got this space where the big idea goes, you know. And it becomes very static. And I think it was very much compensating big ideas, for it to look like it sort of did last year. Pieces of the bike, the bike chain would make a mountain, or you know, those kinds of things. It never became like, a personal thing. Only to come back a week later, so we started, we told him all our ideas and then he went “Oh yeah these are my ideas`, because it's his company. Yours are crap, mine are great. We're so tired of each other. It was so funny because a new girl started, and she'd come to me and she'd ask me, “ Don't you just want to come around here and have a look at this type thing I've done at the bottom?` I'd go, `cool, no worries.` [inaudible 00:36:10] Oh yeah, that's really cool. Don't listen to me, because in therapy, what I say, Andre says the exact opposite of. So, she would go `oh, hahaha.` [inaudible 00:36:26] rest of the day. B It just go to that stage where he'd say X and I'd say Y. I don't know if it's just old school thinking and new school thinking coming in. He's the person in the situation that doesn't want to take the risks.You know what I'm saying? I'm happy to take the risk, probably because I've got not much to lose. Whereas he's not willing to take the risk because, he's got everything to lose. That kind of conflicts ... and stops you from going forward, I think, at the end of the day.   For example, I design logos. I think the best ones, he would completely shoot down. They wouldn't even get to the client to ... end up presenting. Old school stuff that wasn't cool, as a result. Yeah ... I think, as far as -  think more team efforts. I definitely think that the team was lacking, the sense of we're in this together or we have the same goal, focused on it, I think ... You know a lot of things happened ... you know with the chiefs, and there was a lot of chiefs and the guys doing the work weren't really aware of it. I think if you're not really aware of your purpose you're not going to do it very like, with dedication, with motivation, it almost becomes like the puppet, whereas you're not really part of the play, you know.
