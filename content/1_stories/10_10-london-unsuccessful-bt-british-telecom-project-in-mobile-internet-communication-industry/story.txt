Text: It all seemed great in the early stages. Then it just basically began to unravel because you were dealing with lots of different people and I think this is a little bit like what you were talking about. It was the opposite of a flat, it was very sort of, we had to try and keep him happy, we had to try and keep the client happy.  It all seemed great in the early stages. Then it just basically began to unravel because you were dealing with lots of different people and I think this is a little bit like what you were talking about. It was the opposite of a flat, it was very sort of, we had to try and keep him happy, we had to try and keep the client happy. The client was being threatened with redundancy at the time so his head wasn't in the right place. The brand as a whole, didn't really know what they were doing, what they were trying to say. Very confused by the message. They started off wanting to say one thing then changed it. Just like a series of events which basically kept doing weren't enough and we worked on it for about four months and just kept dealing with it, kept dealing with it. Then always trying to please everybody and in the end it just basically, we had to walk away really and say you all want different things. Unless you all agree on what you want and in the end I think someone is doing it now. Said the same thing. I think it's probably because it's the most recent. but then there's the other side which is the ones that you really hate is the ones where you think you've got something amazing and somebody destroys it for a number of reasons. I could probably say, probably not here but British telecom campaign we did at Abbott Meade which we did so much work for and we ended up doing I think 16 ads for BT before that point so we had a really good relationship with them and we did some really nice work for them and we got to this stage where broadband was just really coming in and they wanted a massive campaign to talk, to tell the customers about what they wanted but it was a bit of a funny situation because we were doing it at Abbott Meade and another agency was involved because we both trying to pitch for this account but they wanted us to work together so it was a bit strange. I think basically the ones that you, I maybe give you a different perspective on the ones that are a real nightmare because there's ones like that Knorr project which were a nightmare as far as so painful every step of the way but then there's the other side which is the ones that you really hate is the ones where you think you've got something amazing and somebody destroys it for a number of reasons. They could've made a great campaign and I think it's because I went away on a holiday and I came back and something had happened. Either they'd given it some loot or they wanted something totally different so they totally changed their mind. There was no way out of it. There's no saving it. We were trying to have meetings where we would talk about ideas and it all got a bit you know their end game they're going to try and stab your idea in the back because is obviously it's all been very nice in the meeting but then maybe saying something like, `Well, maybe you've seen that before somewhere else.` We were trying to have meetings where we would talk about ideas and it all got a bit you know their end game they're going to try and stab your idea in the back because is obviously it's all been very nice in the meeting but then maybe saying something like, `Well, maybe you've seen that before somewhere else.` That vibe wasn't very good but we worked on it for about four or five months we just got some scripts that we were happy with. They could've made a great campaign and I think it's because I went away on a holiday and I came back and something had happened. Either they'd given it some loot or they wanted something totally different so they totally changed their mind. There was no way out of it. There's no saving it. I think it's because you put so much effort and it was along the way yes, yes, yes. And then to totally shift that was probably the most deflated I've ever been in advertising because like Knorr products you just annoyed all the way along but you know what I mean? This painful, like almost painful, painful, painful, painful, but in the end it's like, `Ah, sod it.` Whereas that one was like, this going to be great, this is going to be great, this is going to be great and nothing's happening. Is that maybe a different take on it? In the end they made something totally different which was about these little, it was almost like inside a computer and all these people were, it was like being inside the internet but those people get making things happen. Then they did, what that it or they did one big ad in a coliseum which was a massive, a two million pound production or something. It was quite different from where we were going. Our were all different, it was basically connecting you with, it was connecting you with the internet so because their internet was infinitely varies you could connect to with an infinite amount of things so creatively it was like a maze and you could just do that with hardly any restrictions. All you had to really do was create something that you think people would like so people who loved Elvis were, we did scripts around that, someone meeting Elvis who was a big Elvis fan and it was just, it was a very creative rich territory. I can't really remember what the final scripts was because it was a whole big campaign but it was just very creatively rich and one of those things that they had the money to do it and it was all looking good and it would've been a big, big campaign for us personally and for BT. I think that's what made it even worse as well. Yeah, but they seemed like they were, they narrowed down and then there was a big change. I'm not exactly sure why. Maybe a little bit in the risk taking. Maybe. I'd say it was more probably political from the two different agencies. I'd say that was probably the overlying factor. Some CEOs with cigars or something. Something happened. I think they took the long term approach as far as to be a bit ... They still held the accounts. It wasn't a case of them going into the CEO of BT and being like, `What the hell are you doing? Why are you doing this?` It was just sometimes you have to go, okay. Yep. Fair enough. Quite pragmatic about it. They're still paying the agency a lot of money so. I think basically you do get, sometimes you have prejudices come into account if you've had a bad experience on that account sometimes you do bring that on but I think I suppose that's why me and Lawrence is chaps as well is we try just to keep going and we do believe that you can do a good idea for anything. It's just about keeping your standards high and saying I want to do another good ad.  think I suppose that's why me and Lawrence is chaps as well is we try just to keep going and we do believe that you can do a good idea for anything. It's just about keeping your standards high and saying I want to do another good ad. I think what happens if you keep doing it and they keep saying no then you'll likely just get to a stage where you just don't want to work on it again. That's quite tough to keep going and keep going but sometimes you have to.

All you had to really do was create something that you think people would like so people who loved Elvis were, we did scripts around that, someone meeting Elvis who was a big Elvis fan and it was just, it was a very creative rich territory. We did a load for them before and then they wanted a follow on thing. I'm not exactly sure but when we were working on that brief the broadband one, the start the very open yeah, they just wanted it. Project brief was quite scary because it was quite big. The thing is we're never, because we've been courses like mind mapping courses and we've been through all that. I don't think we employ any actual contactics or anything like that. I think we just do what we do naturally. What we normally do is we both think about the problem for a bit and then one of us we have a little idea so we talk about it and see if that sparks off anything. I suppose it is mind mapping because you're bouncing off each other. It just goes, it's got the ability to go off in different directions so you're using it that way really. I think that's probably the main route that we use. We don't go too far down a line individually before we start talking because I think that's quite bad. You might as well work on your own if you're just going to do that because if you're going to think of an idea and then go, `What'd you think of that?` You might as well say that to your creative director. I think it's try and talk earlier if you can. Yeah but the people who were really making the decisions we weren't really talking to them that much. I think that's a factor. It was always like we were both, I think because we both really pissed off so it was nobody's fault. I can't think of a situation where you'd think, `Oh, that was your fault that it didn't.` You know what I mean. you might say, `Oh you didn't come up with very much today but you wouldn't say that anyway. It's not [inaudible 00:50:48] related by it, do you know what I mean? He's just as pissed off as I am. Yeah we had to get a relationship with them. They were pissed off as well. I think it was literally it was a political thing or something happened in a late stage that we didn't know about. Sometimes that's really frustrating. You get it and something happens that you haven't heard or totally out of left field that you have no kind of say in or you have no control in. You can solve problems if you can help solve the problem you feel like you're in a bit more control but if things come out of nowhere that you've got no control over or you can have no say in, it's really hard because it takes all your job away, takes all your power away.   I think basically you do get, sometimes you have prejudices come into account if you've had a bad experience on that account sometimes you do bring that on but I think I suppose that's why me and Lawrence is chaps as well is we try just to keep going and we do believe that you can do a good idea for anything.
