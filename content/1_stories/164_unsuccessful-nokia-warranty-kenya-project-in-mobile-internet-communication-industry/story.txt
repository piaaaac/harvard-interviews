Title: Unsuccessful Nokia warranty (Kenya) Project in Mobile/internet/Communication industry

Text: Project that didn't go so well... I don't think there's an option for a project not to go well. Yeah, it's definitely the process. Well, there was one and it was received well by the client's representative whoever they were, and they would approve everything and say... Well, not approve, but they said, "This is great. I'll take it back and present it to my people." She took it back and presented it to her people and came back and nobody liked it. There were too many heads that she was talking to and they were contradicting each other about certain things. They were being subjective about everything and not objective. So, that came back. We found another route, did it, worked well. Fit it in nicely with a global position on [inaudible 00:25:29] Services. Well, she took a presenter, too many heads, came back and then we decided to try a different route. Always. You know I am. So, we tried a different route and took it quite far until we decided the client service actually decided we need to have... To consolidate everybody and sort of consolidate all the opinions and discuss them first before we can move forward. We did, and it just all came together, slotted into place and it's now on it's way out. So, very happy. They're having a few issues. Very tolerant. I'd say it's medium, because the argument was structured in such a way that they could not second guess us. We had, again, researched, backed-up, previous campaigns that have done a similar thing, 'cause that's what they wanted the money to do some of the things. So, we used their results and the feedback from the consumers that they got and incorporated it into our rationale. Their minds were put at ease before we went into creative and discussed. We had to do wacky things. Interesting. They did not really know what their problem was. It was impossible, because they said their consumers were illiterate or unintelligent and very literal. So, we had to educate them in all of this and we basically came to the decision that this had to be a process. They wanted to... I wouldn't say they even knew their consumer, but they wanted to educate and create awareness all in one ad or one campaign. It was impossible, because they said their consumers were illiterate or unintelligent and very literal. So, we had to educate them in all of this and we basically came to the decision that this had to be a process. Oh, the brief. The brief was indecisive. No, it could have been a lot more useful. Yes, basically. It got re-drafted and changed into a simpler message to follow through. Well, timing was not appropriate. They wanted everything here and now when it just wasn't possible, but also everything they were asking for. The budget was completely inappropriate. No, we convinced them otherwise. Especially on timing and the budget. I mean, if they wanted it done now, it's rather better to wait a while and do it properly, because you only have so much budget. I mean, you don't want to do it again. Basically, they decided to do the three phase, or the yearly process- Very young. There's no real relationship yet, they're still building it I think. I think we just got the client at the beginning of this year. Relationship's not there. They need to have a rapport- They did try. They took everybody in for conference, well not everybody, a select few people went through to a conference in Dubai and spent time with their people, our people. Getting to know each other. So, it definitely kick started things off, but a once off doesn't really fix it. Very good. Very good. Definitely buddy-buddy. Client service? Also good. Not buddy-buddy, but good enough. Yeah, could be tighter. The strategy, it was also a very good relationship, yet at the same time looking to them for answers, I mean they're there to tell us, "Are you right, are you wrong," because Kenya in my mind looks different to Kenya in their mind and they've obviously done research on it. Sort of look to them for inspiration and solutions within their answers. They were being subjective about everything and not objective. So, that came back. We found another route, did it, worked well. Fit it in nicely with a global position on [inaudible 00:25:29] Services. Well, she took a presenter, too many heads, came back and then we decided to try a different route. Well, there was one and it was received well by the client's representative whoever they were, and they would approve everything and say... Well, not approve, but they said, "This is great. I'll take it back and present it to my people." She took it back and presented it to her people and came back and nobody liked it. There were too many heads that she was talking to and they were contradicting each other about certain things. Pretty large. Large, I'd say. The idea is they really never had a big picture. They sort of did, but they didn't tell us about it. Our picture was a little bit smaller than theirs. They have phases that they want to go through, so a yearly thing. This was supposed to be something memorable, that could carry on-  hey wanted to... I wouldn't say they even knew their consumer, but they wanted to educate and create awareness all in one ad or one campaign. It was impossible, because they said their consumers were illiterate or unintelligent and very literal. So, we had to educate them in all of this and we basically came to the decision that this had to be a process. The brief was indecisive. They wanted everything here and now when it just wasn't possible, but also everything they were asking for. The budget was completely inappropriate. Are you right, are you wrong," because Kenya in my mind looks different to Kenya in their mind and they've obviously done research on it. Sort of look to them for inspiration and solutions within their answers.
