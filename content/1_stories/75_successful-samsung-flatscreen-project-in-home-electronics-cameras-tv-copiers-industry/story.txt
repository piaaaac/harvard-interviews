Title: Successful Samsung flatscreen Project in Home electronics/cameras/TV/copiers industry

Text: Here's another thing, as an industrial designer, probably for some other industrial designers. So industrial designers have some problem in idea maybe, it's complex problem, industry and, you know, the whole market, and demand goes in a pendulum, in a direction that's a reason why. Internally, we spend too much effort on the [inaudible 00:13:48] and initial work. Which is, a strange idea. Since we spend too much effort on the initial research step, we have only two weeks to actually sit down and start to bring your own perspectives and creativity. But this project, Samsung TV project, we really shortened down the whole initial step, and we spent enough time for designing actual project. Do you want to see that? There is certain project which it can be scared by that initial step. So, I think then what left is personal creativity based on our current idea background. Collaborative [inaudible 00:17:30]. Probably medium-high, not really high because TV, you know, designing TV is [inaudible 00:18:20] someone. And, they really pushed us to have new, innovative idea, but there's not really core technology or the latest innovations there. There's not technology, we can't really innovate, yeah.  And then because Samsung is a very hierarchical place, so like, higher-up guy like that and then there's some decision-maker and if decision-maker decide that than it's pretty straightforward we can go there. Luckily, the decision-maker from our side liked our ideas so it really went well. We had more than ten years relationship with Samsung guys, so it was really efficient to work together because while we don't need to spend time to get to know each other and we don't need to spend lots of time to persuading, we don't need to transparent what this whole process are, so we just basically trust we can specially develop our own perspectives and then they'll [inaudible 00:22:01]. So, the super senior guy, you know one of ones the list, he was director, and there was another guy, sort of like PNY and the senior designer, and there was a tech support and beauty support. Actually I was [inaudible 00:23:04] and I worked with a lot of junior, very junior interns, so we worked that way. So since Mike was, really super senior, so I didn't really, I don't think we very collaboratingly worked together, except that we worked very well collaboratively, but he was more like a come in once a week or twice a month and then checking this and that, so yeah, that was it.

Because like, some project each team is very uncertain of what to do. Sometimes clients came to us even what the problem is, even they don't know even what the problem is. And they very, very vague, you know, situation. Then we need real CS resource from someone there. Also, some sort of new offering, or new something for huge customer, and if it's really unknown stuff, then I think this whole process is really very awful.
