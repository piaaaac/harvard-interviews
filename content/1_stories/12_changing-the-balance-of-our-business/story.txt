Title: Changing the balance of our business

----

Text: The Covid-19 pandemic is changing the balance of our business: box scheme demand rose sharply during lockdown, and we took on an extra 30% of subscribers, mostly older people who were shielding. We also had to turn away many potential customers who we were simply unable to serve. Most of the new customers have stuck with us, and spend per customer across all the boxes is up 20% too. But we have had no farmers’ markets. Overall the increased veg box income has almost equalled the lost market revenue. If Covid-19 continues into another year, we may sell solely through the box scheme - the only real downside of this is that veg box customers buy about 75% veg and 25% value added produce from us; whereas market customers buy less veg and more higher value products. To survive on veg sales alone we will need to rent land and plant more; or we can look for alternative markets for our processed foods. We also had staff shortages during lockdown, as our overseas trainees booked to work with us for the season could not travel. Instead we have taken on and trained two new local people – this is good to do, but they are not getting the formal educational back up they need, as there are no Scottish higher education institutions offering horticultural or local food training to them (LWA September 2020).
