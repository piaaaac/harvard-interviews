Title: Unsuccessful Listerine Project in Health/wellness industry

Text: They wanted - what did they want? They wanted bus stop shelters for this year's campaign. I think they have a campaign every year. So this year's campaign they wanted to do bus stop shelters for - basically for branding. So what happened was we said "yes, let's do bus stop shelters. I mean, it is something you want. It doesn't really hurt anything. So let's just do that" I think the idea was pretty generic. The idea was like - you exercise and then you exercise three times a day, two times a week to keep your body healthy so you should just gargle your mouth like, once or twice a day for one week. Thirty seconds to keep your mouth healthy. It's the same logic as why you exercise, right? So they may be targeting people who are health conscience in a way. People who actually go to the gym, more active, all that stuff. I mean - I would think - as I walking - a very obvious media by would be in the gym. They had a pretty limited budget. I think it was - I can't remember how much was the money? So anyway they wanted to do things like bus stops and all that stuff. It's just a little bit too mass and it's too expensive. For price it's [inaudible 00:37:03] so it's not very cost effective. We were actually suggesting to them like "You know, because you are targeting at pretty specific people, so maybe you should - one very obvious place to advertise is at the gym." Right? Maybe you can have simple things, cheap things like mirror stickers for example. Right? To tell people to make sure you gargle your mouth every - twice a day. And you can have - in gym's for example a lot of them with a view. There's quite a few where it's along the road. For normal pedestrians, they see people working out at the gym. So maybe you should just borrow out the whole thing off them exercising. Off you exercising in live zones like a live action thing of them exercising and then have your message there. Right? So gargle twice to keep your mouth happy. I mean, we as a team - we were trying to basically get them too spend their limited budget on effective media and not on the conventional media. I think at this time, conventional media - it still works for branding purposes but it's really not very cost effective. So it doesn't really make any sense at all for them to spend so much money on these things and then it's so miss. Right? But somehow, they were just not very receptive to new native eyes. They just feel "If I don't have an ad in the newspaper, nobody will know what Listerine is". And in this day and age, that's not the way it is. Even for online where this idea of, you know, you have a Facebook application or something and then you have this little tool which is like a Listerine, so it's like a Listerine bottle, right? So what happens is it's a tool, it's an application for you to clean up your teeth for your pictures. So if you upload pictures from Flickr or whatever. That's going to upload pictures on Facebook or Flickr or whatever. You can actually go to this application. And then somehow, I don't know how it works but you just program it to whiten your teeth. So it's basically an application for your brand and industry. So it's simple things like that. They use on the chance that Facebook is hot. People use Flickr. It's not expensive to produce. It's pretty long term no matter what your message is, it's really long term. You can actually use it for a couple years. It's extremely well to your brand. Your product. They were like "No. It's not really well." They always want to follow the norm. What other people are doing. Which, obviously is not effective. Anymore. I guess it's pretty much the same. I mean we were all pretty excited initially but I think with this particular client, they are really not receptive to good ideas so - there are a lot of times when - especially the suits who are presenting - they tend to be on the safe side as well. I would say that - I guess for them. After working for them, for the clients for awhile, they become a little bit boring themselves. They become very safe and they become very uninspiring actually because most of the time they are like "Oh no. I think they work like this." They were pretty alright other than the fact that they are - they try to be safe simply because of the size of the client. That was a bit frustrating but other than that I think that accounts is actually - they usually try to support our ideas. mean, we as a team - we were trying to basically get them too spend their limited budget on effective media and not on the conventional media But somehow, they were just not very receptive to new native eyes.
