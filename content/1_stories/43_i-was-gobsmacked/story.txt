Title: I was gobsmacked

----

Text: The amount of people we were supporting in a relatively small area of Glasgow tripled. We went from support about 50 to 80 people to having support 250 to about 300 people at the peak. And that was through weekly food parcelsâ€¦ And this is just a very small part of Glasgow I'm talking about. So you're talking about 300 people were needing emergency food support to stop them going hungry every single week. And when you extrapolate that for the whole city, I have no idea what the figures are. But I was I was gobsmacked by the need that kind of came out with COVID. I think what we saw that was causing the need, was a number of things that were really exacerbated by COVID.
