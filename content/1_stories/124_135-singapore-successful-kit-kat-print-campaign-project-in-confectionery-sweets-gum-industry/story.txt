Title: 135 SINGAPORE Successful Kit Kat print campaign Project in Confectionery/sweets/gum industry

----

Text: Okay. In that case, a campaign we did for Kit Kat, which is a print campaign. I liked that project because the brief was, “Have a break, have a Kit Kat,” and it's the most classic tagline ever. How do you re-interpret that idea? It seems like everything has been done for that before, so there are a lot of restrictions when it comes to big brands like Nestlé, like Kit Kat, in terms of the number of years they've been having certain requirements when it comes to an ad. In this case, we had a classic brief where it was re-interpret or express, “Have a break, have a Kit Kat,” in an interesting way, but you must use the snack device, which is the break, you must obviously logo, use the tagline, and must reference a situation that you are having break from. Already from a print point of view and a creative point of view you've got like all these tick-boxes, and how do you come up with a fresh idea based on that. It was a brief that I worked with another three guys, and we had all struggled with it for weeks. It was one evening we just kind of stopped thinking about it, and we had a few beers, and we just ... I mean, I can't really tell you how the process happened in terms of the idea creation, but it was a very low-key guy kind of evening where we were just drinking beers and really talking a lot of crap. From there we kind of just started to talk about Kit Kat, but not in the sense of trying to meet the brief, but thinking of weird ideas. It was because we were in a relaxed environment, and we were having fun with it that we actually came up with an interesting way of executing it. For me, that's probably a project that went well, because despite the struggle, just through collaboration and not thinking about the project as much we actually came up with an interesting execution on it. That's probably one that I can think of recently. I think, from the client point of view, they like to be seen as accepting of creative ideas. Whether they are truly open to the ideas, I'm not sure that they necessarily are. I mean, if you put onto a scale, I think they are willing to buy-in to creative work. This particular client was willing to buy into creative work. I'd say a six maybe in terms of being open. I mean, it is easy to do work that the client likes, but for us we've always been trying to push the creativity on our biggest clients. Those are obviously the most rewarding ones when you manage to crack it, 'cause Nestlé is a massive client, and they are not easy to get good work through. Especially for a product like Kit Kat where it's got such a strong heritage, to be able to actually add something to it by come up with something original, I think, is more rewarding than doing something very creative for a product or a brand that's not very well known. Because, if you've got a new product, it's a can of soda or something like that, you can do anything, because nothing has been done, there's no comparison. So, for Kit Kat, it's one of those things where it's a bit daunting because good work has been done, you're trying to do justice to a very classic tag line. Yeah. It was one of those ideas where we all instantly knew that it was a winner, and we felt very strongly for it. All four of us were like, “this is it.” I think in terms of ideas that we present to our creative director, we showed him more than one, because otherwise he would be like, “What did you guys spend all your time doing?” We did show him other ideas, maybe three or four ideas, but we concentrate on doing this one a little bit more finalized in terms of doing a scan, drawing it up, making it look how we perhaps envision it. 'Cause we wanted to sell it. Then, obviously when he saw it he knew that was the right way to go, and it was a matter of just pushing it to the client saying, “We've got a fantastic idea and we think you should run with this,” and he saw it and it's very hard not to like it, because it's very Kit Kat territory, yet it was done in a very different way. Actually, even though it is a very creative idea, he bought into it very easily. Always open to good work, even if the work is initiative work where we've wanted to push a different angle to a brief that they've given us, they're open to it, whether they buy it or not is another issue, but they're always willing to accept work. If you call up and say, “We've got some great new ideas for you, would you be interested in looking at them?” They're always willing to actually ... I think that most important thing for a client is to actually be open to ideas, so at least you've got one hurdle down because a lot of clients are just not open to them, so they're just like, “Yeah, you've got good ideas, but I don't really care 'cause I don't need them at the moment.” It's nice to have someone that says, “Yeah, sure,” whether they can do it or not it doesn't really matter, it's just the fact that you can approach them, so at least they're receptive to them. Good. I mean, in terms of creatives we had three writers and one ad director. That's not the normal kind of mix, I mean, usually you're working in ad director-copywriter team, wherein this case we were just jamming ideas and that's what we came up, and it doesn't really matter if you're a copywriter or an ad director, it doesn't matter what your title is. I think for us as well especially [inaudible 00:25:24] tried to not make titles depict the type of work that you should be doing. And, in this case, it was a very visual idea, and then you got three copywriters coming up with this sort of work as well. Secondly, whether they like it or not, which is personal, but everyone is allowed to have their opinion whether they like something or they don't like something. In this case, obviously, we met the brief and he liked the work. It was an easy sell for him, and he liked it, so he was passionate about the way he sold it as well, which does help. You need to have everyone on board when you're trying to sell work, because it does come through in terms of how a client reacts to work is when there's a lot of passion there, I think they can sense it. It was because we were in a relaxed environment, and we were having fun with it that we actually came up with an interesting way of executing it. For me, that's probably a project that went well, because despite the struggle, just through collaboration and not thinking about the project as much we actually came up with an interesting execution on it. That's probably one that I can think of recently. The brief was a classic Nestlé brief in the fact that it had a lot of requirements and mandatories, and usually that is the killer of any creative idea, so in this case we really had a lot of check-boxes and we knew it was one of those briefs that is gonna be tough, it's not going to be an easy one to crack. You can either make the decision now to have a very painless process and just do a classic pack shot for them with a nice line on it, you could go the easy way out for sure. It's a bit like when people get Nike jobs, and stuff like that. You obviously want to try and live up to the expectations that a lot of good work is being done, and to go above that is always the challenge.   Then, obviously when he saw it he knew that was the right way to go, and it was a matter of just pushing it to the client saying, “We've got a fantastic idea and we think you should run with this,” and he saw it and it's very hard not to like it, because it's very Kit Kat territory, yet it was done in a very different way.
