Title: Unsuccessful SKT remote control Project in Home electronics/cameras/TV/copiers industry

----

Text: And we've been given that project. It's great. Brilliant opportunity. I think the hard thing about it is that it's a Korean client, who are like, ridiculously demanding, all the time. They need validation for everything that you do. They need to validate it. So hierarchical, it's just unbelievable. It's also a US project, so it's brought over from the US, so it's put very tight in the margins. Yeah, it's really, really good. Yeah. Fantastic project. Don't know what else to say about it, really. It's another project where we think, fuck, what a miserable piece of work. Why don't we just do it ourselves and sell it? Because they're gonna fuck it up. We've given this amazing design, right? And the problem is they don't know how to employ it. They don't know how it would take [inaudible 00:24:16]. And we help them with all that stuff. Of course we do. If we can, and you wanna pay for it, we'll help them. And we'll help them succeed. But with Asian clients, they don't, they just go, oh, give me the project. That's it. There's your money. See you later, Ideal. It's very hard to have any kind of relationship, build a relationship with them and get a trust going. Essentially, they're manufacturers, and they go, just give us the [inaudible 00:24:41], and then they make it wrong. And it's a nightmare. And they do it all wrong. The design intent's completely lost. And they end up with this shit design, and they go, oh, well, Ideal designed it, shoot. And it's because they haven't implemented it properly and it's a big problem. Because they've just done this big million dollar project, and then all of the sudden, Ideal's going, oh, if you give us another hundred grand, we'll help you implement it as well. And it just doesn't settle. They're all just trying to get their heads around the design, the whole team's going off now to start to make it, and it's just like, it's just so hard to get anybody in the organization who's got the clarity to actually go, yeah, we do need this, and I'm gonna take charge of it. I'm gonna liaise with Ideal and make sure that our teams are doing the right things. I'm gonna check in, we're gonna send review documents, [inaudible 00:25:51]. Cause in a way, it's reversing the relationship. We've been sending documents to them all the time, and they've been going oh, we don't like this idea, oh, we do like, can you change this? Can you change that? But all we're essentially asking the client to do now is send us a document every two weeks on how the development's going and we'll review it, and we'll give comments and suggestions on how to do it. And clients don't like doing that. It's a completely fuckin' weird position to put them in. No, they're not used to it, but it's that collaborative element that's really important that clients just don't do. And that's why they fall down all the time, cause they can't... It's me and Steve, really, on the big decisions. The two of us. And the client's side, again, we had to find the presentation, like, two weeks ago, and there was like a CTO and CEO from the, every fuckin' department in South Korea Telecom. It was crazy. There was like 40 people in the room. So I don't know, it's very hard. I mean, there's two people, essentially, that we're hearing decisions off, in the [inaudible 00:27:45]. But again, it's very hierarchical, so really, decisions don't get made - so hierarchies - the guy who makes the decision is the boss, the big boss. He's the one that... he has to be told every decision. That's why it's so hard [inaudible 00:28:01]. It's worse. I mean, European companies are much more wont to risk, but the Asian companies are just like - especially companies that produce computers and mobiles and stuff, they're all in this race. They're all competing with each other like, we have to get product out, next month, next quarter. We have to get the same features as Samsung's got. We have to get the same things as LG's got. It's just this, they're all just self-perpetuating, sort of, thing. Apple [inaudible 00:28:46] at doing this. It's just going right, let's step back, let's spend five years or something, let's develop the iPhone, and then put it out, right, and it'll blow everyone away, and it did. But Asian companies don't do that. They don't stop their order and go right, we're gonna really think about this now. We're gonna do something that's really worthwhile, because they're all in this horrible, like, you know, let's just make loads of shit, that's all there is. It was pretty clear. I mean it was a pretty tame designer, [inaudible 00:29:48] TV in a remote control. It was a really clean brief. But in fact, we changed it all along, but it was a clear brief from the start. Yeah, it became less clear, but it didn't become less clear, it's just that they often try to change it. But it's still very clear in the brief. In my eyes, it's still very clear what we're doing. Yeah. Very fucking funny. They don't talk. They don't say anything. Weirdest conference calls in the world, right, you won't believe it, mate. You'll sit in three hour conference calls on the phone with them, right? And there'll be one person speaks from their side, but there'll be eight of them sitting 'round the phone. They don't say anything. It's this whole opinion thing. They don't say anything. And you're always like, you feel daft, cause you're always asking, are you all right? What do you think? You show them stuff, and they have no opinion. And you're just like, well, what do you think? And they go, oh, I think the CEO might think it's a bit, like, it's not colorful enough. Or they'll always talk from someone else's point of view. So you can never get that, well, what do you think? Do you like the fucking design or what? They won't tell you. So it's very weird. On the last one... the trouble with a lot of Asian clients is that they just treat you like a supplier. Do you know what I mean? You go into their board rooms, and stuff, and the CEO, he'll go up, won't even look at you. He'll sit right at the front. It's a room the size of this, with all these fuckin' [inaudible 00:35:03] microphones. You gotta talk in a mic, right? He'll sit right at the front. Everyone else will sit right at the back of the room. Anybody who's not important will sit at the back, right? So it's just this ridiculous kind of hierarchy. And then the main guy, they'll all bow, and then they'll scuttle off somewhere, to the sides of the room. Any you'll be like, well, where's anyone? Please come down, we can't see. You've got a screen this big. And it's very hard to communicate on a basic level. On a basic level, it's impossible. And they just don't respond. So you go, like, come down, you have to come closer cause you need to see this screen. We've got TV here, we're gonna [inaudible 00:35:44] one. And they're like, come down! They won't say anything, cause they're not allowed to say anything. And then you have to look at the main guy, like, can they come down, and he'll go like, yeah, and he'll go like that. And then they'll all come down. Absolutely mad. I think it's great. Again, I'm working with people who I know very well, so we know each other very well, and that helps. I've been lucky, I guess. I'm mostly a person you may trust a lot. It's fine. Trust's a big thing. You've gotta trust your team. You've gotta empower them to do their own thing. Once you've got a level of trust set, I think [inaudible 00:36:59]. Yeah, of course it does, yeah, it's like boyfriend-girlfriend, isn't it? You know each other well, you just know how to start things. You don't have to have your dating period. It depends how honest you've been about it. If you've held it inside and you haven't talked about it at the project review or something, then you have this deep-seeded resentment for somebody in the team, then that's gonna be a nightmare. You're gonna have a problem. But again, I think, being professional about it doesn't allow that kind of thing, and you have to just get on otherwise, there's team members I've worked with before that've been quite intimidating. You know, they've been very experienced, and they've been very opinionated, and you're just like, okay, now, hold on a minute, I don't actually agree. Can't you just slow down a bit? there's team members I've worked with before that've been quite intimidating. You know, they've been very experienced, and they've been very opinionated, and you're just like, okay, now, hold on a minute, I don't actually agree. Can't you just slow down a bit? And you've been intimidated by them. And then if you get resourced with them again, clearly you're gonna think, oh, fuck, I'm not gonna do that again. But If you've voiced that concern to them, I know it's hard to do that, but you have to. You have to say, look, you know, in the project review, I think this bit didn't go very well because we didn't talk openly about the ways that we're gonna work together. That's how most people do it, actually. Important to talk. Each time there is resentments. I think you would just have conflicts, because you all have to take a role. And normally a conflict arises where people are overlapping too much on certain roles. So, you know, if you've got two interaction designers working together, you normally have one who's doing documentation, the other one is doing creative visualization. You don't have both of them doing visualization because they'll just go like, no, my idea's better, I like this better than yours. They'll just fight the whole time. And if you have someone on the team who wants to be a project manager when you're the project manager, clearly you're gonna get into an area of conflict where roles are... you've just gotta define the roles. That's hard, I know. I've never been in a really bad situation where my role has been... actually... Great. We were all friends with each other, really. It was good. I mean, we got a new VHF girl who it was her first project, first big Ideal project, and she was great. It was kind of stressful for her, but she was cool, she's really nice. It's very hard to have any kind of relationship, build a relationship with them and get a trust going. Essentially, they're manufacturers, and they go, just give us the [inaudible 00:24:41], and then they make it wrong. Millions of companies just make millions of different devices that all look exactly the same, and they're all shit. And they'll user desirability is just completely, not even a part of the thing. ou'll sit in three hour conference calls on the phone with them, right? And there'll be one person speaks from their side, but there'll be eight of them sitting 'round the phone. They don't say anything. It's this whole opinion thing. They don't say anything. And you're just like, well, what do you think? And they go, oh, I think the CEO might think it's a bit, like, it's not colorful enough. Or they'll always talk from someone else's point of view. So you can never get that, well, what do you think? Do you like the fucking design or what? He'll sit right at the front. Everyone else will sit right at the back of the room. Anybody who's not important will sit at the back, right? We've got TV here, we're gonna [inaudible 00:35:44] one. And they're like, come down! They won't say anything, cause they're not allowed to say anything. And then you have to look at the main guy, like, can they come down, and he'll go like, yeah, and he'll go like that. And then they'll all come down. Absolutely mad. 'm mostly a person you may trust a lot. It's fine. Trust's a big thing.  I think this bit didn't go very well because we didn't talk openly about the ways that we're gonna work together. That's how most people do it, actually. You don't have both of them doing visualization because they'll just go like, no, my idea's better, I like this better than yours.
