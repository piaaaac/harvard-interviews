Title: Exposed how unequal

----

Text: What the pandemic has also shown is that it's just exposed what a lot of people already knew about the welfare system and about how sort of ridiculous these seen off people on lower incomes and no incomes are and I think that a lot people already knew that - I think that to the broader general public, it's become a lot more clear. And I think that a great example of that sort of inequality is the sort of the vouchers, the meal vouchers that kids were getting the amount into sort of think, like 15 pound a week, or I think, yeah, and like he out help out the saving middle class families, like hundreds of hundreds of pounds a week on their meals at the outlet. I think that's, I don't think that's gone completely amiss for folks. I think people have flocked onto that. But I think it's just exposed how unequal our society already is.
