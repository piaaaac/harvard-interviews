Title: 92 SANTIAGO Unsuccessful Hites department store Project in Retail industry

----

Text: We always worked for this department store, we tried to work with care both graphically and creatively but it was really impossible. I mean I know that it is always possible and that you can improve it little by little but this was a case of study I believe. We handed in ideas and we began to work on them and we made more briefs, excuse me, we handed in more scripts and at the end of all of the scripts they would say, “No” they wanted to show the guy who is the campaign image, “I want him showing the products” and that always happened. And that was one failure after the next. I was working with them for two years and they were two important failures because we could never sell the client anything that would interest them, and I felt that it was entirely ________ to not be able to offer that. I believe that was a huge failure, electro-offers from HITES. The clients, there were three stages, marketing, management and general management and generally going through the first stage was very difficult and reaching the last one was practically impossible, they were like ten people in total. It was a very informative brief, they were very clear on what we had to say, so then the briefs were more about displaying the product so then the briefs were like, “We have to make a commercial for HITES for electro-offers on their electronics, and these are all of the prices and the famous________ “ which is how to place the things on the grid, there wasn’t much. And it was not really necessary to do those things because with that type of client it was more about making a showcase rather than anything different. We handed in ideas and we began to work on them and we made more briefs, excuse me, we handed in more scripts and at the end of all of the scripts they would say, “No” they wanted to show the guy who is the campaign image, “I want him showing the products” and that always happened. And that was one failure after the next. It was zero, really zero, I can’t even say two because it would be too generous, it was very low. Very little time and a very low budget, it was very, very low despite being a large store, it was very cheap. They gave us very little money so then we had service providers that were not so good. So then that is a synergy of things that happen because if your service provider is bad then generally the final product is not going to be as good as if you paid more money. What happened with these clients is that they asked for everything very fast, they had very poor manners with the people from accounts, we just dealt with them in meetings and they rejected a lot of work. Since it was a big client they knew the power they had to demand the things they demanded. I mean, that would never happened with a small client, you were supposed to obey their demands which they made with only one day’s notice. Things that are unacceptable, this made for a bad relationship.   There were good relationships within the team, this client exhausted the team also, and obviously we were here until late hours on several days in a row, and that generated a very uncomfortable environment but there were always good relationship.
