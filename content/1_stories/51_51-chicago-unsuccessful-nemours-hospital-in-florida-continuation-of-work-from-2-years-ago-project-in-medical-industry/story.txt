Title: 51 CHICAGO Unsuccessful Nemours hospital in Florida (continuation of work from 2 years ago) Project in Medical industry

----

Text: And that's kind of how I approach all these projects, and I'm trying to get a lot of feedback from my colleagues that I'm working with as we go because they all work differently. All these practices work differently, and we're working across practices more and more, so you need to keep two stakeholders happy. It's a continuation of work that we did two years ago or something, so the client already trusts us, which makes life a lot easier for us. We did choose to focus it around the emergency room experience, and that's often where we can best demonstrate how our process works, and we focus on actually getting something implemented or prototyped at a later stage, and then you can take that same learning and apply it to other zones with the hospital, for example. Because it's just selling the project, we haven't done it yet, so it'll include research in the emergency rooms, but we'll probably go and look at analogous situations. So we might go and look at a, you know, like the analogy for the surgery is always the pit crew at a race car place. That kind of thing. So other analogous situations. Nope. Pretty good. Are trusted. Yeah, they were asking for the same staff and we don't have the same staff anymore.   We haven't said we can't do that. We've said we'll try and that's the best we can do. look at analogous situations. So we might go and look at a, you know, like the analogy for the surgery is always the pit crew at a race car place. That kind of thing. So other analogous situations.
