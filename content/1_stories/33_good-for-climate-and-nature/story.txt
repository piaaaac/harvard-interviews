Title: Good for climate and nature

----

Text: I think when you turn up at the supermarket, and there are things just not available like flour, and a lot of people are doing baking at the moment, it does make you kind of think twice about where that's come from and who's produced it and what impact that's had really on nature as well as people, like what jobs has that created. Another issue… is food waste. I think when you're eating three meals a day at home, you're a lot more aware of what you're chucking in the bin. And, you know, the first couple of weeks we weren't quite getting it right, like the amount of fresh food we were buying versus the amount of dry food and stuff. So we ended up maybe wasting a bit more than I wanted. And so we've changed our habits a bit to make sure we're not doing that as much and like coming up with creative ways to use up odds and ends. I'd say my three key takeaways from all of this have been that I want to limit my food waste as much as I possibly can, support local businesses as much as they can and get food from places that it's grown in a way that's good for climate and nature.
