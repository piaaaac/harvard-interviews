Title: 30 NYC Unsuccessful DTC christmas website/print Project in Luxury industry

Text: Corporation, company. And it was for the Christmas spot. No, actually, sorry. Yeah, that was just frustrating, just because, it was not a disaster. Far from that. But, it was frustrating because of the limitations of the project itself. I mean, one spot for Christmas, for diamonds. It just screamed cheesiness from a distance. And you knew that already, so from even before starting to work on the brief, on the project, and so it's a bit frustrating when your idea, like your goal, you know already that since the beginning that your goal is to, the best thing you can achieve is to make a spot that is not cheesy Corporation, company. And it was for the Christmas spot. No, actually, sorry. Yeah, that was just frustrating, just because, it was not a disaster. Far from that. But, it was frustrating because of the limitations of the project itself. I mean, one spot for Christmas, for diamonds. It just screamed cheesiness from a distance. And you knew that already, so from even before starting to work on the brief, on the project, and so it's a bit frustrating when your idea, like your goal, you know already that since the beginning that your goal is to, the best thing you can achieve is to make a spot that is not cheesy. So, not a great spot. Not something you're proud of. Just something that it doesn't embarrass you. And that's never a good place to be. When you get a new brief, you're supposed to be excited. But, when you get a new brief, and you know that the best you can do is not to do something embarrassing, it's not a great place to be. And the process was a bit tiring too, because we, you know, even if we knew that we could never do anything like amazing, we still tried to do something a bit different than what they usually do. Say, `Oh my god, that's even worse than what I thought.` So, in that sense it was painful. And in the end we got something produced. Decision makers in-house ... well, one frustrating thing is that in theory I, my role in the team was creative director. And when you're director of anything, you're supposed to make some decisions, but I had no decision input, whatsoever. So, that was frustrating too. That's always, when you feel that you're not, you cannot exercise your ... you cannot work fully, and express yourself fully as the role you're supposed to have in a team, then it's always frustrating, also from a creative point of view. Completely different from anything else. No other client will tell you, `Oh, we want to take risks.` Sorry, `We don't want to take risks.` They will always tell you, `Yeah, we want to take risks.` But, then you show something and they freak out. So, zero tolerance. Money was not an issue, because they have all the money. Well, you know, we were not rushing, so it was an issues, just because we knew that we had to deliver before Christmas. I mean, it's a Christmas project. You cannot postpone Christmas. Postpone Christmas. [crosstalk 00:43:51]. But, we had enough time to work in a kind of relaxed, not too stressed way. So, it was not a huge issue. Yeah. And it was okay, but you know, because we shared this frustration of knowing since the beginning, that okay, we're in a journey that was not going to be very exciting. You know, there was a lot of frustration. So, when you shared the frustration, the relationship with them was fine. But, when you share the frustration, you tend to sometimes, you know, complain about things, and influence, and effect the mood of the other person. Then gets depressed, because you're depressed, and then it's like a negative mood. I don't know, I don't think it affects the project in this case. It's hard to tell. It's hard to tell, because you know, you don't have anything to compare with. You cannot say, well maybe if we were more excited, we couldn't done something better. I don't know. It's hard. You're not, it's very theoretical, so it's hard to tell. There was not a lot of excitement, yeah. It's never good. I mean, you know that you're working with an autopilot on. Where did it come from? I don't know where it came from. We both focused on, again, we couldn't focus on what's the most creative thing to do for this brand, because there was no way to do something, because the limitations were so, you know, it had to be about love, about a couple, about a couple giving a diamond, a man giving a diamond to a woman. Showing the diamond, showing the reaction. Those are all elements that we couldn't get rid of. So, you almost knew what the spot would look like before even the brief. So, we really concentrated only on how to avoid the cheesiness. So, that it's at least acceptable, and when people watch it, they say, `Okay, that's nice.` It's not super creative, it's not revolutionary, but it makes me feel good. It's nice. They're not trying to sell me something too hard, or it's not cheesy. And actually, there was an article in USA Today that I received like last week, when they talk about the best commercials in 2007. And I was surprised, because that commercial was chosen in the 10 they chose for the exact same reasons. Like because it was not trying to sell anything too hard, because it was honest, and not cheesy, and not overselling. And there was always something that he didn't like. At the end, he picked this script. I think it was just the way they manage relationships. I think it was mainly ... the client wanting to show the agency, wanting to give a bad time to the agency. In the first meeting. Then the second meeting they chose a script, and they were very happy with the script. And then after that we shot the commercial, then we did the edits, then we presented the commercial that was exactly like the script, and the client was furious. Saying, `What is this? It's horrible.` I said, `But, it's exactly the same.` It's horrible, so it's really like a power demonstration, a demonstration of power. Like it's one meeting, I will be painful and torture you. The second meeting, I will approve everything. The next meeting, I will torture again. And after that, I will approve everything. It's really like a weird kind of relationship. We had to rework on the edit again. But, usually when you shoot something, you make sure that you shoot enough for different, for anything that can happen. Okay, if the client doesn't like this scene, is there a backup scene? So, you always shoot different options. Well, we have, you know, I tend to have really good personal relationship with everybody. So, you know, I treat them like friends. So, they were never really bad. I mean, usually, especially in big agencies, clients, account people usually look like they work for the client, instead of working for the agency. They're literally the mouth and ears of the client. So, sometimes it looks like they're working against you. And it was a bit of the case here too. But, because there was mutual respect and trust, and friendship, it went smoothly. Yes. And then there was, Ty, he ... we had to present all the scripts, and then he decided which scripts to present. He picked, I think, four or five to present. But, yeah that was my one impact, not my first impact, but one big impact with corporate America. And the very traditional thinking, very closed, narrow-minded, not open to any what if question. So, not a great spot. Not something you're proud of. Just something that it doesn't embarrass you. And that's never a good place to be. When you get a new brief, you're supposed to be excited. But, when you get a new brief, and you know that the best you can do is not to do something embarrassing, it's not a great place to be And to get hit on the head every single time with feedback that was more and more conservative. And say, `No, that's too far.` When we went only like this much too far. Like two percent too far. And they said, `No, that's way too far.` That's always, when you feel that you're not, you cannot exercise your ... you cannot work fully, and express yourself fully as the role you're supposed to have in a team, then it's always frustrating, also from a creative point of view. well, one frustrating thing is that in theory I, my role in the team was creative director. And when you're director of anything, you're supposed to make some decisions, but I had no decision input, whatsoever. So, that was frustrating too. `Oh, we want to take risks.` Sorry, `We don't want to take risks.` They will always tell you, `Yeah, we want to take risks.` But, then you show something and they freak out. Time was an issues, because yeah, it had to be very tight. You know, there was a lot of frustration. So, when you shared the frustration, the relationship with them was fine. But, when you share the frustration, you tend to sometimes, you know, complain about things, and influence, and effect the mood of the other person. Then gets depressed, because you're depressed, and then it's like a negative mood. well maybe if we were more excited, we couldn't done something better. I don't know. It's hard. You're not, it's very theoretical, so it's hard to tell. Painful. Painful, because it's a client that is very ... I don't know, a bit of a ... diva and likes to torture the agency, and make people feel his power. And to make people feel that he's the client, and we're not good enough, and he knows everything. So, before we got to that point of having a script approved, we presented, there were different teams working on the project. Five or six teams, maybe. So, a lot of teams. And we presented, I don't know, maybe 20 different scripts.   `What is this? It's horrible.` I said, `But, it's exactly the same.` It's horrible, so it's really like a power demonstration, a demonstration of power. Like it's one meeting, I will be painful and torture you. The second meeting, I will approve everything. The next meeting, I will torture again. And after that, I will approve everything. It's really like a weird kind of relationship. So, they were never really bad. I mean, usually, especially in big agencies, clients, account people usually look like they work for the client, instead of working for the agency. They're literally the mouth and ears of the client. So, sometimes it looks like they're working against you. But, because there was mutual respect and trust, and friendship, it went smoothly.
