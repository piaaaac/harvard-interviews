Text: They gave us a briefing and we didn't do a big research, but we did basically the classic thing where you just sketch ideas, sketch ideas. It's almost like an old method. Then you develop lots of different concepts. Yeah. It's a crazy process. But anyway. At some point fairly late in this game I made a sketch. It was just an idea which came, I don't know, it came out of nowhere really. It was the idea that you have the phone as a clip. You can put the phone into a holster and then flip it up. In this case, the phone is the clip. Yeah. The screen was on one arm and the battery was on the other side. Then in between it was flexing. That was just a very rough sketch. Then I made a model. Super basic. Super basic. Just simple shape. Then that got presented. There's always this back and forth. What's our idea and then how does the client react to it? Then if it's positive then we develop it further. Then it went into some market research studies. We made a beautiful model. I don't know how they tested it. Then it came back and it was tested positively. Then they decided, okay, now we want to manufacture this thing together with Chinese engineers in Beijing. I think the transition from this simple idea then to actually make it work, well then you have to worry about how is it actually made. Well, in this case, it was pretty high and they failed. The overall project failed. Yeah. They really wanted to do something different. Direct. Very direct. Yeah. Changing. The core team, the three of us, how we started it was, I don't know, there was sometimes some tension. It was this project leader, another German guy, and then a woman who was somehow very tense. Sometimes it just got a bit tense. I don't know what made her so high strung. I think it was all about, again, this is the old school design thinking, you have to have one vision and then you have to really ... The idea is very much associated with a person. It's the person's idea. She really wanted to pursue her ideas. We sometimes said it's just not really that good. Then just went back and forth. briefing and we didn't do a big research, but we did basically the classic thing where you just sketch ideas, sketch ideas. It's almost like an old method. There's always this back and forth. Then we had to negotiate back and forth tenths of millimeters what we would like to do. That was interesting.   She really wanted to pursue her ideas. We sometimes said it's just not really that good. Then just went back and forth.
