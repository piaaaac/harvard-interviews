Title: Unsuccessful All bran Honey Bran/Kellogg's Project in Food industry

----

Text: We worked on a Kellogg's brief towards the end of last year where it was briefed into two teams and there were two ways of taking a brief. It was, the brief had the normal proposition that we would work to that there was a celebrity that was involved in a prior ad that was still interested in using that brand if we needed to carry on. So when we were developing our ideas we took that on board and followed the brief as good as we could.

So when we were developing our ideas we took that on board and followed the brief as good as we could. Halfway through the project it was suggested that we could also look at an alternative solution not using the celebrity and coming out with ideas. Throughout the course of the project, the two teams separated and we were concentrating on the celebrity idea to appease the client while the other team developed other ideas. We all had, there was no animosity between the teams but eventually it turned out that all of our ideas were killed due to a marketing decision further up the chain so we wasted a lot of energy early on developing ideas that ultimately didn't ever have any chance of going anywhere. So it was quite disappointing because we had a lot of meetings where a lot of positive stuff was talked about but it never actually got off the ground. So from a project perspective, the loss of opportunity. It was pretty disappointing.

So from a project perspective, the loss of opportunity. It was pretty disappointing. The brief started off being good but it got muddy and unclear as the project went on due to internal decision makers. The goal posts were moved slightly in terms of what you were focusing on so that was- I think this project we had internal review which the CD's couldn't attend and we pitched all our ideas and it went down very well and I thought well you've cracked it. And then we had to pitch those ideas to the Creative Directors. It's interesting, at the start of the meeting I think my partner mentioned that the suits were very happy with these ideas and I think that triggered them to talk the opposite stance and the CD's said no we don't like any of these. Now it would be interesting to see what happened in that circumstance if we said nothing and then pitched the ideas. Looking back that probably contributes-  We all had, there was no animosity between the teams but eventually it turned out that all of our ideas were killed due to a marketing decision further up the chain so we wasted a lot of energy early on developing ideas that ultimately didn't ever have any chance of going anywhere. They weren't really prepared to take some of the more extreme, well not extreme it wasn't extreme, still kind of a very safe option.
