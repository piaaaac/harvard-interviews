Title: 44 CHICAGO Unsuccessful American Red Cross increasing blood donor base Project in Medical industry

----

Text: Okay. It was my second project here and it was a six month project so it was a really long project. And it was a team of four of us. And I think part of, personally, why I didn't feel like it was successful, is because I wasn't happy with my role and it was mostly because I didn't know the company well enough to figure out how to make my role better. But it also was a situation where the project manager was very hands on and controlling of the content, and so it felt very directed instead of team based as a project It is a nice luxury to have to be able to go back to a client and say, we know this is what you want, but we think you really need something different. The biggest time challenge was that because the project was so large, although it had one decision maker on the client's side, there was a big team of people who were involved. We had check ins every two weeks for six months, so it really felt like we were racing to have something tangible every two weeks. Which made it, I think it interrupted things a little bit because it always felt like, if we weren't at a point to show something, we had to be. So we just had to sort of speed through things in order to get there. You know, I think that the relationship with the client was good and I think that it's continued to be a positive relationship in the projects following this, as far as I know.  why I didn't feel like it was successful, is because I wasn't happy with my role and it was mostly because I didn't know the company well enough to figure out how to make my role better. It also was a ton of work and we didn't have quite enough resources, but by the time that we got down to the wire it was a little bit too late to pull the right people in to help. But it also was a situation where the project manager was very hands on and controlling of the content I think it probably could have been a lot better. I didn't feel a whole lot of ownership over it, so I think that was part of my problem with it. Blood donor base. So we basically went in and tried to figure out what people's opinions are about donating blood and why they were, were not, and how to ... you know we found that once people got into the experience, it was often really chaotic and unprofessional and they never came back. PROJECT ID So that was the main things we focused on, is the mobile sites that often attract first time donors, but yet are the type of sites that are so disorganized because they move from location to location that people who have never been in a donor position before feel like it's really awkward. And people are yelling and fainting and they often never do it again.   I don't think necessarily. The biggest time challenge was that because the project was so large, although it had one decision maker on the client's side, there was a big team of people who were involved.
