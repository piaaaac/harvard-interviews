Title: 176 SHANGHAI Successful Pharmaceutical (health practice) Project in Medical industry

Text: I think it was also a medium one. It was definitely not one of the huge, big projects. It was also in terms of the positioning of the project was more a strategic one for IDEO as well because it was actually the first project we did looking at the same schools. It was about an area that I hope to grow into more. On the client side we had one key contact. He handed it, basically, over because he got promoted in the middle of it to another guy. There were two but their core team consisted of four people. It's a health practice and it's so restricted so I think it was high. With everything we suggested it was like, `No you can do this. No you can't do that.`, which wasn't so much the client, but more the industry we are working in. I would say between mid and high. At the end of the day, I think the inspiration came from sitting down and really allowing us the time and the space to talk through things. We also had collaborative workshops where we asked sales people from the client company to actually come and join us and do a prototyping workshop. Those were helpful because it showed us, again, how difficult it was to design anything in that space. The guy who was our key contact, he was even too busy to pick up the phone. We had a really hard time getting in touch with him. Then it felt like the more contact we actually did have, the more times he came over and we presented stuff, as the Danish are very straightforward, very honest, blatantly honest, also very clear about what he wanted- I think there were ... it was like a typical guy's dynamics. I was the only girl on the team. Two guys and then Scot, the graphic designer, joined us so it was four of us. Then our ID person joined, this other guy. The coaches were ... No, there's, our BD, she's female but it was a really, sort of, buddy relationship with the team. There was a lot of joking. There was a lot of sharing but then there were also really intense moments where, I mean, we were all out in the field. We're connecting on Skype. We meant to do a download but then we just said, you know what, I'm actually just so exhausted about things. Thanks to Hunts being so gay about it, although he's just not. I think that just made the relationship very rich. It wasn't a superficial project. Also, I think, because all of a sudden we realized how many people have diabetes. How many lives have been touched with diabetes. How all of a sudden we hear stories about how, especially older doctors, never change their treatment since they went to med school 20 years or 30 years ago. You suddenly realize that it is an epidemic that is spreading especially in the U.S. I think that was something where it was also quite hard for us to go through emotionally and see all this and have doctors that tell us, `Yeah, and I tell my patients to workout and to do more exercise.` Then you see all their staff members that are barrels. You just think they will be your next patient. I think, first of all, it was a lot about understanding. We went out and did ride alongs with [inaudible 00:06:17] reps. We went to, all three of us which is quite rare, went to different locations on our own. Usually people don't go out on their own for HF. Usually always two people. That was really exhausting but at the same time allowed us to get some insights, I think, that were more intimate in a way because it was just a one on one conversation. Like with you now and not with a team of three where you're a bit like, okay, should I say this or not? There was a lot of sharing but then there were also really intense moments where, I mean, we were all out in the field. We're connecting on Skype. We meant to do a download but then we just said, you know what, I'm actually just so exhausted about things. Thanks to Hunts being so gay about it, although he's just not. I think that just made the relationship very rich. It wasn't a superficial project   No, because it was positioned so strategically actually on the health practice have given us permission to not work on the margins, to actually sort of just do what we had to do. For example, I was supposed to be pulled off that project after the human factors phase was over, but, I mean, I said I really wanted to learn. I really wanted to have a chance to finally be on a project a bit longer. Once I talked with them it was like, you know what, actually it does make sense to expose you more to this because hopefully we're going to get more projects like this. In the end the health practice said well, don't worry about margins and that was quite special. That also made life so much easier. A lot of the inspiration, I think, was actually coming from being with really cool people and sitting down, talking, and then having some time to yourself going through things. Then looking at things again and going like, oh you know what, that really reminds me of this and this. Check out this web page and sending each other YouTube clips, web pages, interesting stuff.
