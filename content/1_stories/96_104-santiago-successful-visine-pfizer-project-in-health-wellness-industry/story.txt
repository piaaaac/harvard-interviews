Title: 104 SANTIAGO Successful Visine/Pfizer Project in Health/wellness industry

----

Text: I believe that the projects we have done that have been of most value are the ones that started out hard. I believe that a good project we did was ADO, which is an Olympic sports brand here in Chile that to begin with the clients were a series of, they were, how do you say when there are a lot of people? A council that decided on the campaign. Well, there is campaign in the first thing that I had told you about, about the self-management to come up with campaigns which was something that was important because we won a Lion from Cannes, which was a campaign for Visine, the Visine eye drops that could remove eye-redness. It was an ad that did not have a budget, so then we thought of a campaign that was something, I mean it was complicated because it had to be remembered and it had to be impressive but we did not have any money to do the campaign. But to tell the truth we just paid for this, so then it was something that won the award for best newspaper ad in Cannes and it took a lot of work to do it because the client didn’t want to do it at first, there was no money to do it, we had to, I had to stay on new years eve to launch the ad publishing, alone here waiting to publish but with all the faith in the world. To tell the truth when we got the news I felt like spending another new years eve here. I wouldn’t mind at all. Very small, in fact what they do more than anything is placement on television and very little for newspapers and magazines, they didn’t plan for it. We used it, in that case they didn’t know either because it wasn’t really clear on the brief, it didn’t really state what they wanted because it was a minimum opportunity, it was either that or an Internet banner. I believe that a ________ in Cannes is a good test. No, it was too low. Yes, normal, normal. Very good, good. Yes, I mean it is not that we changed it but they wanted an ad and we generated an alternative media. So then they accepted it because it met their needs stated in the brief. With accounts sometimes there can be differences, let’s say, and the executive we had in that project at the time was an executive that was very helpful in that account but at that time there was a change of executive. So then we faced a person who did everything in order to sell the project and another person that came in with another perspective but he or she didn’t understand that we had already gone with another idea so then she saw it as a personal attack instead of something that was good for everyone. In the sense that planning contributes with insight, with things that can help sell the campaign and in this case from all of the creative reasoning from the campaign that had to do with the publishing timing, which was how we can finally sell the ad? I mean selling the ad and the creativity in the format, which was that people at the time were more exposed to having red eyes. So then they were confident that the time to publish was correct, January 1st which was next day from new year’s eve. So then we had to convince five or six people that the campaign was good. It wasn’t a traditional campaign, it was from the ________ point of view, but it was very audiovisual so then we had to visually show the interior of a person. So then it was a very serious research on how we could do that commercial which in the end was like a ________ of situations. So then everything that we did was coming along very nicely because the graphics were very nice, the texts, the copies made you want to become a sports person when you read them, and well that is it. It is very fresh and we are enjoying the success. But to tell the truth we just paid for this, so then it was something that won the award for best newspaper ad in Cannes and it took a lot of work to do it because the client didn’t want to do it at first, there was no money to do it, we had to, Yes, yes there was - as a matter of fact after what happened here they opened their minds and they asked us for more things. They asked for more projects and also to manage more things from their products on retail. There was a mind opening and I believe that it was because of this event. That is why we were focused on doing something that worked visually more than inventing a concept because there wasn’t any money to generate photographs or anything. They were able to understand when, if we told them that the brief didn’t necessarily have to go in that direction they had the ability to have a different opinion and to generate a new brief to do a better work. Very good, very good. They are relationships where you can - I mean when we finish working we can perfectly get up and go somewhere else, we are like good friends who know how to work well. We don’t see work as an obligation so then there is a self-control for the things we generate, very healthy mentally.   So then we faced a person who did everything in order to sell the project and another person that came in with another perspective but he or she didn’t understand that we had already gone with another idea so then she saw it as a personal attack instead of something that was good for everyone.
