Title: An American indulgence

----

Text: My mother in law is a terrible cook and she always bakes cakes that fall in the middle. She says she’s tried correcting everything. However, I’ve introduced her to the box cake. I love a good Betty Crocker/Duncan Hines devil’s food chocolate cake, and I will buy the icing in the tub, too. It’s such an American indulgence - all that sugar. But it comes out perfect and moist every time, and I can do it in 20 minutes with a few eggs and oil for under £5.
