Title: Unsuccessful Ford Mondeo launch Project in Transportation industry

----

Text: It's Ford, yeah. They've launched this new kind of business car and we also are asked to do the whole campaign for it. We have quite a good idea, but during the execution and when the final result comes, it's not that satisfied, yeah. The production value. Basically it's because of the post production, it needs quite a lot post, but when the results come it's not what we imagined, the perfect result we expected. Different reasons. One is time and budget. I think the other reason is the job itself it's quite difficult in the production level, and other thing is the cooperation between the multi-national team because we have foreign director, the local [inaudible 00:15:12] production office, the client side, the agencies. Quite complicated. For this particular TV production lots of time spent on the research and also spent on the purchasing procedure which is quite odd for this brand. Everything goes to that purchasing department so we waste three or four weeks. Yeah. Kind of vague and it's not sharp enough in that whole category, so it's not that different. I mean from the strategic point of view, it's not that sharp, yeah. With account service, actually I think in big company like JWT, especially here in the Shanghai office, peoples personal relationships usually are good but if you're talking about, the work, the project, the main conflict usually comes from the timing, that's the thing people are usually fighting for. The deadline and the timing for, preparation for the presentation, and production. The production value.Basically it's because of the post production, it needs quite a lot post, but when the results come it's not what we imagined, the perfect result we expected. I think the other reason is the job itself it's quite difficult in the production level, and other thing is the cooperation between the multi-national team because we have foreign director, the local [inaudible 00:15:12] production office, the client side, the agencies. Quite complicated. Different reasons. One is time and budget. ...everything. For instance, every time the company have to spend amount of money, like over the budget, they have this special department to kind of control the financial and to do the bidding thing. That's quite different comparing to other clients I'm working now.  One of the reason is the big company the whole procedure actually sometime you waste a lot of time on those things which are in fact not that important, but to just waste time, the back and forth, the paper work, the sometimes you gather everybody for a meeting, or you wait for the client side, or the internal side. I think some of the time are wasted and some of the time, like I said, on the research and the purchasing, No one knows what it's for. Sometime we spend to many time on the confirmation on the brief. So it spends even more time on the planning and account services side, comparing to when we think about ideas. Finally when we get the brief and we think of the idea. We only have like 10 days or one week. It's not like other client, maybe you can postpone a little bit on the launch day or air day, but here the launching of the car, usually because they have this car show, or press conference, blah blah blah. So, usually the deadlines fixed but when every step takes more time you just squeeze the production.
