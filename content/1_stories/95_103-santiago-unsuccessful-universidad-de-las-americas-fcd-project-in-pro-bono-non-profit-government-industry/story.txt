Title: 103 SANTIAGO Unsuccessful Universidad de las Americas (FCD) Project in Pro-bono/non-profit/government industry

----

Text: The name is Universidad de las Americas. It is the largest private university in Chile, where basically what was the most complicated was that there was a creative work that sought to give a twist to all of that communication that is very homogeneous in Chile. Because all of the universities say the same and they promise the same things, and we tried to make a completely different publicity. And the client was just paying us to generate ideas that they thought were good. So then they pushed aside as creatives and they took us as designers and all of the good ideas were put aside on our computers and everything. We presented the ideas that we wanted but they would say, “Thanks a lot for the effort but we want this” and they would hand us copies of ads from the United States and they wanted to replicate that over here. They were a local client, and the other issue was that it was an account that took a lot of our time and there was a mess with the schedules. We worked a lot for the account but there was little profit. It was very normal to stay from Monday through Friday until three or four in the morning creating ads for all of Chile but our time was misused because we were checking ten thousand ads with different directions in Chile, because they were twenty ads with different formats. They were ideas that the agency did not support because they lacked creativity and they did not set the apart from the competition. I believe that it was a failure, maybe they did meet the objectives because the objectives were clear, they were to elevate the number of enrolled students. But it was too much time invested for us, almost all week, we were physically exhausted and each member’s creative process was stuck because we didn’t need to do a lot of work per say, and we didn’t need to think a lot because it all came to us already done, it was imposed. It was a mess because the people from low rank came together with the medium and high rank people and they would all speak and it was impossible. They would all give their opinions on the campaign, and the owner the man from the highest rank would listen to all of the opinions so then there wasn’t anyone in charge of guiding or deciding on the alternatives. Zero. They didn’t want an innovative campaign just something that was done and proved. The brief was very extensive in the sense that it was a brief for a six month campaign and it did suffer some changes during the period as the market was reacting to it. If not so many students were enrolled then the brief would change. There was even the possibility of doing another campaign within this admission campaign. It was a very confusing brief because it was changing with time, it wasn’t something that was thought all the way through the end. There was time but it was not enough considering the amount of work, but there was money, enough. I mean, what I think is okay you don’t want to accept so then I am going to give you just what you want, so then there was an indifference. I mean the presentations were done properly but without any added value. Planning was a more discrete department, they were not a good department, they were a couple of people that you had to look for in order to get them to hand in the information, they wouldn’t come to you and help. It was a very discrete department, not a very good one. They were involved but they handed in their part of the vision to the client, so then what happened was that the agency worked in different areas that didn’t mix and we didn’t present a direct proposal, they were asked for a different one. It was like working with walls that never allowed us to see each other. ecause all of the universities say the same and they promise the same things, and we tried to make a completely different publicity. nd the client was just paying us to generate ideas that they thought were good. So then they pushed aside as creatives and they took us as designers and all of the good ideas were put aside on our computers and everything. but our time was misused because we were checking ten thousand ads with different directions in Chile, because they were twenty ads with different formats. They were ideas that the agency did not support because they lacked creativity and they did not set the apart from the competition.

There was even the possibility of doing another campaign within this admission campaign. It was a very confusing brief because it was changing with time, it wasn’t something that was thought all the way through the end. That was the most tragic or funny, there were like twenty different campaigns and they didn’t choose any of them. I mean there were two or three months of thinking, one campaign per week thought and executed at a sketch level and they didn’t choose any of them. It was a relationship of - it was a good relationship as long as we did what they wanted. When there was a proposal and we defended that proposal there was even the risk to loose the job or to have trouble with the boss. I mean, it was a very indifferent relationship. You hand me the ideas and I will deliver them because there is no possibility to deliver you anything else but what you ask for. They were bad because there was a conflict between the creative director and the partners because there wasn’t a - the creative director wouldn’t dare to ask the owner of the agency for some work warranties, like for example not staying there too long or the work being excessive. So then that generated like an environment of dissatisfaction. We were not satisfied; in fact a lot of us left the agency because of that.   With accounts the relationship was very bad because it was like having the client in our house. It was like working with the orcs there. It was like working with walls that never allowed us to see each other.
