Title: Unsuccessful Banco de Chile Project in Financial industry

----

Text: Yes. There are pitches we have won for creativity or where they have been very relevant, but I feel that most of them are obtained a different way, through letters. And I think that you put too much into – I love the idea that my teams invests itself a lot in pitches and every time we get it it’s like a new toy, perfect; but I feel that sometimes very powerful things come along and the decisions are made based on something else, no the campaign. I feel that it’s a failure. I feel that even when you have presented great ideas, they weren’t enough and it’s like a kid’s thing, but that they weren’t capable of breaking the personal agreements, the – how do we call it? – Off the record meetings where most decide if the account will come over or not, _______ the money. That frustrates me a lot, I don’t know if the project is a failure but – I think we did an excellent job and in the end it went to a very bad campaign, you are watching it on-air and it’s very bad. So you start questioning – and it has happened – whether it’s good to present such a good idea or if it’s better to present something more comfortable to win the pitch. I feel that it as a failure because we wanted to innovate and we wanted to say, “Let’s say it differently.” We presented great pieces, but in the end it went to what we suspected might get it. I feel that failure in not having said, “You know what? Let’s not do something as creative. Let’s do something with more effects with a song that everybody will hum every day and let’s win the pitch.” I feel that it’s a failure from the creative standpoint, not having given up or not understanding that there are some basic roads that work for winning.

Yes. Huge. I saw one of the clients who is friends with the creative who won the pitch. But he was able to smell – I mean, that creative having that closeness with the client could’ve sold the sky to this client and he didn’t. So I sometimes ask myself what I would have done had I been him. I think that I would’ve said, “You know what? Let’s risk it. Let’s risk it with something that people say ‘Wow’” No, he won but that trust didn’t make him take a risk with a more important and creative campaign. Metrogas and the creative was Metrogas and they had a good experience working together, but what I ask myself is that had I had that same experience with the client, I might’ve risked it. “Hey, if the client knows me, he’ll believe me. Let’s present him something risky.” And it might’ve been a mistake. What he did was, “I know him. I know he would buy something risky from me but I will present something that works for the pitch.” It’s bigger than a normal project because you usually involve more than one team. You usually involve one team in each project – I say team referring to creatives and account people. In this case from the manager to two teams are involved. So time, energy in the idea. It’s very demanding. I would say that I am going on vacation after the pitch. No, most of them were middle-management and I would say that two were higher level. So directors, the rest weren’t. I think that one of the great barriers in creative processes is that you have a lot of meetings and a lot of idea presentations to middle-management people who don’t take decisions. There is a lot of fear in selling those decisions, so there’s a big waste of time in making adjustments to what they think the boss will think and when the boss comes he has a totally different opinion, even changing the brief at times. Think there’s a great waste of – What happens is that I don’t understand how to evaluate that. What I did feel was that on this project, on the side of the agency, there was a big investment in testing and in doing things that required an inversion in working hours, tests, and in finished pieces. We generated pieces, we did animatic. The presentation itself was pretty ambitious, closer to a larger client for a previous pitch. There were resources because the client is very big; there was a lot of money. And part of that tension in the air is that we have built a team that will stay up working till 7 a.m. and talk to each other next day and hug us just the same. We may have big differences, different points of view or how we have to start a creative process and we see that what matters is the project and there’s a trust among everyone. We all respect each other’s work. There are not authority conflicts or managers or directors that impose their position; we have a pretty horizontal position at work, regardless of whether there is a certain responsibility assigned. So that causes us to face each situation, even if we win them, we have the energy – it’s so fun to work together at the end of the day that we are capable of facing another campaign and start from zero working on another pitch.

Think there’s a great waste of – Cordial, cold enough not to make the commitment to stay with us and it’s funny but I think there was a lot of acceptance and a lot of expressions that usually don’t take place at pitches.

There was a lot of pressure on this Banco de Chile project, and the pressure didn’t generate not so stimulating things from the account department.
