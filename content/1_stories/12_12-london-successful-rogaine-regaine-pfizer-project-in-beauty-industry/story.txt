Text: Again it goes back to the client. It's quite interesting brief. In a way it was a bit of a [inaudible 00:16:53] brief to say to try and grow your hair but he was again, he was very straightforward. He was a little bit crazy but he was very inspirational as far as he would come and go. I want some really good ads, he really believed that good ads were going to to sell his products and he was right because they did. We just wrote a few campaigns for him and again he didn't buy everything. You'd go and present him some stuff and he be, `Guys this is not quite right,` but it was one of those things we got to the stage where if we wrote something that we really believed in, we knew what was right for the brand and say when we went to present it we mostly knew that he would buy it and again he didn't do any research he just went if he believed that was right he would sign off the money and he would go make it. Those were the two best because I think that's the best scenario if you've got a client who is powerful enough to make things happen and who's strong enough character to believe in his own judgment and I know it's tricker now because you have to do research, you have to prove to certain bosses and other people that this is going to work but people with a really strong drive I find are the best clients because they say, `Look, this is what I want.` It's not always easy but if you give them what they want they'll say yeah.

Rob and I find lots and lots of clients now just default to, I won't ever make the decision. I'll see what certain people think. It all meanders away but he was the best and he was a really good guy as well. He was quite funny and it always was just an enjoyable thing working on that. We got some good ads out of it as well that we were very happy with. Rob and I find lots and lots of clients now just default to, I won't ever make the decision. I'll see what certain people think.

We got some good ads out of it as well that we were very happy with. Yeah, but this was the good thing about it, I think he had a situation where he had the trust of his bosses that he ran this account and I think obviously Pfizer, big company. They're a pretty scary company and I imagine they researched the hell out of everything but he somehow whether they trusted him enough, he ran the account. Yeah, he was particularly risk tolerant because he realized how he needed to stand out within his market and he wanted a point of difference and he knew that in that area there's lots of ads that people didn't believe and he just wanted communication which he had a very factual message but he wanted to do it in an entertaining way because he believed that was the best way to target his audience and he was right. It's not often you get a client who's got exactly the same beliefs and mentality as you. I think that's the same in any walk of life, if you meet someone who's going in the same direction as you it makes everything easy. When people all going different directions when it gets hard. It's pretty straight, it's basically they had a claim where, what was the exact claim? Where one out of five people it definitely grew your hair back. That was their claim. Don't know how they came to that but they had a pretty strong claim. That was the brief but we just, we actually did a campaign about there are many myths around Regaine has, so we did it on the bizarre myths around regrowing hair. That allowed us to down a slightly comedy route and obviously sell their product benefit. It was good. Budget was pretty good. It was a global budget and two 60 second ads so it was quite a big budget. Again because of Pfizer I suppose they had the money. That was pretty good. As long as he was happy he would feed it through. I think the structure was a bit flat you might say and so the agency helped but it didn't have to do as much as it would've done if what was [inaudible 00:32:00] office with having to deal with trying to sell the end as well and there was never ... South African office was trying to sell it in there and the Australian office was trying to sell it in there. I think it was because he had the power he didn't have to do that much really. Those were the two best because I think that's the best scenario if you've got a client who is powerful enough to make things happen and who's strong enough character to believe in his own judgment I think we're similar in our approach. We're both quite dedicated as we're both have that same mentality if we keep going we keep going and we're quite similar in that methodical aspect of the work. I'd say probably our brains work quite differently in a he'll say stuff that I would never say and I say stuff he would never say. His personality's quite different to mine. God, I don't know really. We just were talking. Most of our ideas just come through talking so we talk about project and one of us might say something and then the other person might say something and then go, `Oh yeah.` That's the way it normally starts. No, I remember we thought of the strategy about there are lots of myths out there that this is the proven way to regrow your hair, I remember that came first and then we just started thinking about funny rituals about ways and then started looking and researching how some country there's actual are myths out there about how people try and regrow their hair and so came to a bit of research factor as well looking into it. Very good. Very good. I think he'd been at the agency before so he had a relationship with some of the account people. They were good. I think it was a solid base anyway. He wasn't worrying about the, oh is this agency any good. He just had faith in the agency so that was good. So we were on a good start.   I think it was one of those things, you always, we had a good relationship with them that you're always going to have differences of opinions about things. There were differences of opinions but there's never any big arguments. It's just like, we think that, you think that, we think that. Back and forth back and forth. You want to do that, you want to do that. As long as he was happy he would feed it through. I think the structure was a bit flat
