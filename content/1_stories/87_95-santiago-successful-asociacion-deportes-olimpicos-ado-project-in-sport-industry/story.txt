Title: 95 SANTIAGO Successful Asociación Deportes Olímpicos (ADO) Project in Sport industry

----

Text: No, there are two project with which I fell in love. There’s a project that won Cannes last year. Regardless of the award, it’s an idea that had been around for about two years. It wasn’t an idea of worldwide impact. In fact, it’s a graphic idea, but what I find interesting about that and the award, was that it was an idea that worked like it should’ve worked despite the fact that in the road other possibilities emerged, but we had the stature – that’s how the art director put it. We were working next to him and he said, “You know, no. If it’s like that, the idea doesn’t have the same power.” And we stood strong that was very hard, to say “no, no” But when it happened, everything took place and the idea was – obviously as does everywhere else, here you finish the working year in December, people get together and we had a client who is Visine, which are eye drops. A client with no money and with strong competition back then. No, no, it’s a Chilean company, what happens is that ADO had a _____ in Spain. They started way before and since there is ADO in Spain, they have won more Olympic medals than in their entire Olympic history and it was that model which was replicated here and we already had some results in the last Pan-American Games with all the athletes. The campaign is also weird. This was always thought of as a public service campaign and what makes me very proud about that project is that the role the agency took on as communicators when we said, “No, this is not a public service campaign.” We had to design, we had the whole architecture of the project, not just what we generally do which are the traditional communication pieces. Well the hard thing about this project was that, I think. There were the people from ADO, which were three plus each one of the brands involved. So each idea, each piece, each slogan, the logo, we had to present that to a lot of people. We had campaign presentations where we had 20 people, 15 people and they all had an opinion. That was – I think that experience has been – in fact I am working on another project now and they assigned it to me because of this experience I had there with this atypical case. Generally, you have two or three people in the decision making process and luckily you have access to the person in charge and if not you have to wait for those floor managers to get to their managers, but in this case it was too many people with a lot of interests and different opinions. When you generate pieces you also had the opinions from the athletes, the federations, the government. It was a lot of people. I think it was high. I think that since the moment when Coca Cola or a bank decide to put money into this, the moment someone decides in a country like Chile where sports isn’t an issue to make it an issue. The risk starts at the very generation of the project. The companies tested it. When you asked me what things stimulate me, there’s something that stimulates me very little and is working on campaigns that will be tested. I hate tests. I feel that a lot of times you learn from tests but that a lot of times they blur the _____ group, it always happens that one or two people are leaders and the person from the company – it’s a great business. If everything goes great, you wouldn’t need to test them. They part from the idea that they have to find something wrong with it. It’s math. If there’s something that makes me uncomfortable is that – it doesn’t matter if you do qualitative testing, you evaluate the ideas and from there you improve the piece. Because – let’s see, I think that this time we didn’t have such a formal brief as we usually do. I have a big issue with briefs. I believe that briefs are very little stimulating. I believe that they are mostly limited to – and in general I don’t know what company has overcome this – to translate to other words that which the client is asking. They are crap, in general, I must say. I think that in the end the best briefs, after they have gone through a creative process and you take that conversation again with them – there are briefs we have returned to the client because there’s an area – briefs, I don’t know why they always come within this comfort zone, where nothing or no one is left outside, where nobody is offended. They never say anything bad about the product, they never say the good – so they are little _____, they are not inquisitive enough, they question very little. They always use the same words, they never have an image, a song, something else fun that is being done. ______ let’s think of something else. I believe that briefs are pretty much just paper work and they don’t get the time, even when they take a week to generate a brief, and you have to put out the campaign in ten days and you don’t see that week spent working on the brief. Do you know what? This time the experience inspired us a lot. I was an athlete and I was a National Swimming Athlete, and it happened that – even when I come from a very athletic family, my family is more of an academic world especially because of sports but I feel that there was a potential in my family and it was abandoned and it was always set aside because it wasn’t a possible career. You can’t live from sports and I am happy with what I am doing and I don’t regret it at all, but for me it was something very personal. It was a challenge. I feel that it was a gift to get this campaign. No, it was a coincidence. For the rest of it I think that the challenge where you had to do everything from zero; it was all designing, it was the architecture of it, from the logo, names, how to communicate because you have to talk one way to the companies and another to the _______ while having the same concept. That was very exciting for everybody. It was a new project in how it needed to be approached and I think that also stimulated the team a lot, where copies were able to write a lot, the art director were able to do beautiful things, each one in their technical world could take risks and say real things. That. Good even when there were so many clients. There were hard times and there were also fights but in general it was good. Everybody sort of took on the flag of reverting our historic reality and the project became more important than imposing your opinion or your point of view or getting your logo in first or not. The common interest overrode personal interest, even with the brands and that generated – made it possible for the project to move forward. Even the companies realized that it was impossible to have so many different opinions, so they chose two different brands to lead the way and it was something that came from them, “Hey, we 15 cannot have an opinion. Who will do it? You two and we vote for you two.” And that was great. Great. In the sense that the project was so important and ambitious that there was a lot of _____ to understand for example the issue of timing on both sides, on the creative side we had to understand that there were things that couldn’t last for months and that had to take less than that because we would then loose the Pan-American games and things like that, and to also understand that we had to look for a strategic campaign or support for the campaign to move forward without losing the execution on TV, which was something that required special effects, it took longer and to say, “Okay, let’s not do the three pieces at once. Let’s do one first.” And to understand that – even in the presentation to say, we are ready to go but we are not all happy. We still have another day, another week to work. Okay, if you are not happy, let’s do it. And the account and marketing team would communicate that to the client and the client would _____. It was healthy in that sense, in understanding that the job had to be a ten and that we all had to work as a team even when it meant to move pieces because of the timing issue. Generally there’s a lot of worry about meeting the client’s deadline, the timing I proposed and in the end it doesn’t matter how well the piece looks. Sometimes that betrays us and I think this time it didn’t. It also made the account people earn our respect and that we could also do our work well and renovate the respect they had invested in us. I think that you always have to I think that when we took on this project, the people from planning was going through some adjustments because it was a very distant planning and with little field work with the creatives. I was a moment of change and that changed, let’s say. There’s another project we have today that’s in essence like the ADO one, where planning has had – I felt that strategically, yes – I feel that planning was very distant from the creative process at that time. but in this case it was too many people with a lot of interests and different opinions. When you generate pieces you also had the opinions from the athletes, the federations, the government. It was a lot of people. If everything goes great, you wouldn’t need to test them. They part from the idea that they have to find something wrong with it. It’s math. If there’s something that makes me uncomfortable is that – it doesn’t matter if you do qualitative testing, you evaluate the ideas and from there you improve the piece. The companies tested it. When you asked me what things stimulate me, there’s something that stimulates me very little and is working on campaigns that will be tested. I hate tests. I feel that a lot of times you learn from tests but that a lot of times they blur the _____ group The brief was to make of sports a relevant issue for Chileans. To put it in the conversations and in the interest of Chileans, the issue of sports on every level, from investing companies, to media coverage, to federations and secure them in the slow and painful job they are conducting, to the athletes in telling them, “You know what? When your younger brother says that he wants to be a basketball player, you instead of saying don’t even think about it, tell him okay, go for it.”   ecause – let’s see, I think that this time we didn’t have such a formal brief as we usually do. I have a big issue with briefs. I believe that briefs are very little stimulating. I believe that they are mostly limited to – and in general I don’t know what company has overcome this – to translate to other words that which the client is asking.
