Title: 224 LONDON Successful Feed Me Bottles Project in Health/wellness industry

----

Text: Feed Me Bottles, I think you spoke to Lucy, as well. Yeah, that went well enough for multiple reasons. On a person thing, I'm very much of instant gratification. And this was a six weeks project, and it was full paced, like we couldn't have worked any quicker, we didn't work stupid hours or stuff, we'd go home around sort of half six every night, but in those hours, everything was condensed. It was like two weeks observation, two weeks ideas, two weeks execution. And this was a six weeks project, and it was full paced, like we couldn't have worked any quicker, we didn't work stupid hours or stuff, we'd go home around sort of half six every night, but in those hours, everything was condensed. It was like two weeks observation, two weeks ideas, two weeks execution. And it was sort of bang, bang, bang done. And it was an interesting project because it's so short that everything has to run alongside each other, so you've got the human factors with the branding, with the sort of communication of it, we even went down to sort of adverts and suggestions for advertising. And the business plan, as well. We had a business factor working with us, so because of that, everything was working sort of empowered with each other, and that sort of put a thread throughout it all and tied it all in. And we think it came out really nicely executed at the end. For me, that was a great project, because we had an awesome deliverable at the end. If you ... Quite often you see projects where ... I mean, not so much IDEO, but quite often you can see things where they're sort of mix-matched and the product's been designed, then the brand's been designed, and something else has been sort of ... That just has to keep the same logo, or they've got some brand values that tie in together roughly, where this was just really different, the fact that everything usually and in any company, you'd have a brand and then you'd design a new product, but the fact that the company was being ... The brand of the company was being built alongside the product means that everything reinforces each other, which is nice. And we think it came out really nicely executed at the end. For me, that was a great project, because we had an awesome deliverable at the end. In terms of what was interesting about it, I don't know if you ... We took a seven percent share in that company in exchange, obviously. So that was interesting, the fact that we were almost ... To a degree, we were the client, as well. So, because we own seven percent of the company, so it went really well. And I was dubious at first as to how that was gonna work, whether we would try and override, because quite often if you get a tricky client, and you sort of have to work out with them, I didn't know if we would be sort of trying to override those with us owning seven percent, or just how mentally you'd get your brain around the idea that if I liked this, and the client didn't, then how ... What would we pursue, then? But it worked really well, it was just things though, the client and naturally we designed to the best of our ability, so it was irrelevant as to whether we liked it, they liked it, we were always both gonna like it. So, yes, so that was interesting. And the sort of, say, merging everything together, of never sort of really heard of the product. I mean [inaudible 00:09:36]. But I've never heard of a project where everything sort of been designed from scratch. Even down to the final thing we passed over last week was the director's business cards and stuff that we designed, so it was like stationary, even throwing in at the end But it worked really well, it was just things though, the client and naturally we designed to the best of our ability, so it was irrelevant as to whether we liked it, they liked it, we were always both gonna like it.

But I've never heard of a project where everything sort of been designed from scratch. Even down to the final thing we passed over last week was the director's business cards and stuff that we designed, so it was like stationary, even throwing in at the end. There's been a shift, sort of more recently, to sort of make things a lot more tangible. Like you'll see a lot of projects print posters rather than do projected presentations, and just makes things tangible, get things on the table, and this was interesting, because in London, we don't really design stuff ... We're not known for a huge amount of project design like Munich and Palo Alto sort of do that, and we do product design comes into occasionally, but it's more in terms of deliverables. Because this was a staff project, so we had like models made and we had foam models and then we had aesthetic models done, from prototypers, and that was really interesting, just seeing people get really revved up and excited about it. Like Suzie was on the project, she's been here for sort of ... 20 years, or something like that. A long, long time. And she's sort of an engineer by training, and she was saying, that it was great to see people's faces like they used to when stuff would come into the office and people would wow, look at this, look at this. Because usually we have like a folder or a poster or something like that, sort of stuff. So sort of stuff's changed. So that was really interesting, really tangible product, in terms of human factor side of it as well. Bringing in the users, that was interesting, because we had foam, so each bottle we designed, we had a foam mock-up made and the users could try that, and it was interesting seeing the different, in terms of users holding a bottle and using a sort of testing, imaging it with a foam bottle, as opposed to looking at a poster, being like, yeah, I like that, it's all right. No, I wouldn't buy that one, it's yellow or something like that. There's probably rarely more than three or four people full-time. Which is also a great thing as well, because it was just really easy to make decisions, it wasn't a women's institute conference, every afternoon discussing what we should do. it wasn't a women's institute conference, every afternoon discussing what we should do. It was like, should we do this? Yeah, okay, let's do that. So, if the team was any bigger, we'd have struggled to get the project done in such a small amount of time. I think because we just had to trust each other and sort of trust their views and opinions. So, if the team was any bigger, we'd have struggled to get the project done in such a small amount of time. I think because we just had to trust each other and sort of trust their views and opinions. But in terms of different projects, I think it's certainly very talked about, because it's a totally different way of doing things, like, we're taking equity instead of money, which is obviously one of the key things. But also, we're designing a company, sort of semi from scratch. I mean, they came to us with the technology, but we've done the brand, and so our deliverable was their pitch to sort of the John Lewises and all this stuff, rather than usually we do a presentation saying, this is what we did, and this is how we got there. Instead it was like, this is what Feed Me is, and it was a totally sort of modular pitch that we give to them. And we were basically, it was great, because we were sort of all empowered the make the decisions in the different areas, so I was dealing with sort of prototyping and production, all the makers, and whatnot. And then so the other guy was doing to final catch, Lucy was doing the ... So we'd throw something in and say, what do you think about this, and then we'd make the decision. . And we were basically, it was great, because we were sort of all empowered the make the decisions in the different areas, so I was dealing with sort of prototyping and production, all the makers, and whatnot. And then so the other guy was doing to final catch, Lucy was doing the ... So we'd throw something in and say, what do you think about this, and then we'd make the decision. But also, so you'd always check your decision, but at the same time, it was a group decision and you always felt like you could just make a decision on your own and that was trusted as well. So if something didn't work, you'd change it, offer it out to the table, and you'd be done. So I know that doesn't really answer your question of a number. They were quite open to it. Because again, because we ... Well, not invested, per se, because we didn't actually give them any money. Because we had a stake in equity in the company, they were quite open to it, and it got to a stage towards the end where Jim, the director, would just say to us, well, what do you think, should we do it, what do you think? And we sort of became the empowered decision makers, and he'd come back to us with light ideas that some of his engineers would have, and like, what do you we think about this, are users gonna want it? It's sort of ... The trust seemed to be there, certainly my from being in the first meeting I was, it was just three meetings down the road, the trust was sort of instilled in us in the beginning, it felt that way, at least. So seeing as we explained sort of our process and how we speak to users, and we were gonna bring in these sort of eight to 10 key users, which were in their demographic, and we'd basically just sit down, hang out, and talk to them and find out what they wanted, and test our ideas against that. So they came to us, this huge bottle. It was only a nine ounce bottle, a standard bottle, but it was the size of a pint glass, and this thing was just colossally huge, and really rather phallic as well. And didn't go down a storm with the parents, when we showed them that, and we suggested that they were gonna put that in their child's mouth. So, we sort of flagged up our concerns around this design, and they were aware of the concerns, as well. But it was a key, that was key to getting the engineering right, and then they came to us, and they were like, it sort of works now, can you make it? But it was supposed to be a [inaudible 00:23:52] but it works now, so can you make it look pretty? And we were like no. We need to change a few things. So for one, this has 15 parts, it needs to have four. So 15 is an exaggeration, but it was probably pushing close to 10. So we shed some parts, which they were really chuffed about, because that sheds cost. They were very cost-sensitive throughout, as well. So, yeah, so as soon as we said, oh, we're going to speak to users and see what they think, and then they were more than open, sort of trust started them. And the fact that we wouldn't just make rash decisions, we'd contact Jim or who their engineers, and double check with them, that A, it would work, because there's no point designing something like, this wasn't the concept, this is something we want to take straightaway to market. So I think it was a good balance sort of between us doing our work and also referencing them. That was quite often, well, not quite often, it was often difficult because so ... Obviously originally we expected to be like sort of a skin job, so they came in with this technology, we designed the bottle, dropped it. And that wasn't to be the case, because we soon found out beyond that this thing was too big, and if it went to market size, it wasn't gonna sell. These required ... So, it became sort of a bit of strip it back, and then redesign a bit, but the client was more than open to ... Like I said, they were aware of it, as well. So, they sort of threw an engineer our way for a few days, and we sort of liaised with him, and checked with him what we could do. And in the end we got sort of a ten percent scale reduction in volume, and decisions like this, which sort of were made quite well together. But, like I say, in terms of deliverable, we knew we had to present a brand, and we knew we had to come up with a bottle, so it was quite clear from the start what it was we were doing. And then it just came down to what we could get in the time, so originally it was set up to plan the bottle and then a range of accessories, sort of bags that sterilize. And then it was clear when we had to take on this extra engineering that it wasn't gonna happen. But the client, again, was more than open to that. They were aware that this was a six week product and they were happy for us to do as much as we could in six weeks. I mean, the key thing was, after the second week, we basically nailed the key thing was the vision, so we wanted to have a great looking brand, and a great looking product, and that was the vision, so if there were a couple of engineering faults that needed to be ironed out, that was fine. The other thing was, because this was a new company, we'd be trying to design alongside their engineers, so we'd be allowing and sort of presuming that this would work. So we'd start designing, say, okay, so it has to come out of a vent, and it has this colic thing. Fine. Like, Lucy's a legend anyways, so she's very ... I can't think of the word. The word's not headstrong, but she's very driven, so she knew ... We all knew that we needed a pack and a brand, and the bottle, and we knew that's what we wanted, and it was just a case of how can we get there? So I think Lucky quite often had difficulty in trying to run a project and do half of the deliverables all at the same time Yeah, there was no tricky relationships. Near the end, the district designer came over from Munich, so there was a few culture differences and stuff at first, but there was nothing hugely difficult. It was just what you'd expect in any normal project. Well, they're self-ironing. So, if people come from different offices and different things are done differently at different offices, like, you've probably found this, like London, I think from what ... I mean, I've not been to any other offices. But I get the impression that London's a lot more laid back office than some of the other places. And we're also a lot more sort of open, so we're a lot more transparent, and we know how much money the office is making, where the money's going, what the pipeline is, what decisions have been made by partners. We're more than aware of all of this, which isn't often the case. everything was working sort of empowered with each other, and that sort of put a thread throughout it all and tied it all in. And it was sort of bang, bang, bang done. And it was an interesting project because it's so short that everything has to run alongside each other, so you've got the human factors with the branding, with the sort of communication of it, we even went down to sort of adverts and suggestions for advertising The brand of the company was being built alongside the product means that everything reinforces each other, which is nice. But it worked really well, it was just things though, the client and naturally we designed to the best of our ability, so it was irrelevant as to whether we liked it, they liked it, we were always both gonna like it. Bringing in the users, that was interesting, because we had foam, so each bottle we designed, we had a foam mock-up made and the users could try that, and it was interesting seeing the different, in terms of users holding a bottle and using a sort of testing, imaging it with a foam bottle, as opposed to looking at a poster, being like, yeah, I like that, it's all right. No, I wouldn't buy that one, it's yellow or something like that. So the difference in terms of opinion by the tangible, in terms of the procedure was quite interesting. I think because we just had to trust each other and sort of trust their views and opinions. It was like, should we do this? Yeah, okay, let's do that. So, if the team was any bigger, we'd have struggled to get the project done in such a small amount of time. But in terms of the sort of actual tangible, when you give it to them in a magazine, so like the final ad sets we put in a magazine, then the context has changed, they're no longer focused on this one A3 sheet on the wall that we're gonna make them look at and talk about. They all sort of picked up this bottle, and then sort of imagined their kid was there, and were like, yeah, that feels awkward, that feels a bit too heavy, and stuff. And they all like voted, oh, we love that, we love that, we love that. And then we sort of passed the bottle around, and they had it in this thing, it was like huge, because on the image it looked fine, then when they held it, and then they sort of sleek design that we had going on, then suddenly, and you sort of had your bottle cap coming out of here, suddenly when they held this, and they'd sort of taken the cap off and they'd held it, they were like, oh, it feels like it's slipping out of my hand. So the perception was all like, oh, that is beautiful, and sleek, and then they hold it, and the practicality's over, this feels like it would slip out of my hand. So, in terms of its scale and size, money-wise it's quite hard to value. But in terms of different projects, I think it's certainly very talked about, because it's a totally different way of doing things, like, we're taking equity instead of money, which is obviously one of the key things. But also, we're designing a company, sort of semi from scratch. it was great, because we were sort of all empowered the make the decisions in the different areas, so I was dealing with sort of prototyping and production, all the makers, and whatnot. But also, so you'd always check your decision, but at the same time, it was a group decision and you always felt like you could just make a decision on your own and that was trusted as well. They were quite open to it. Because again, because we ... Well, not invested, per se, because we didn't actually give them any money. Because we had a stake in equity in the company, they were quite open to it, and it got to a stage towards the end where Jim, the director, would just say to us, well, what do you think, should we do it, what do you think?

So, yeah, so as soon as we said, oh, we're going to speak to users and see what they think, and then they were more than open, sort of trust started them we'd be trying to design alongside their engineers, And they agreed to do that, that was fine, but they said, we don't know about [inaudible 00:28:22], we might need to go back to the valve. But their vision was that we wouldn't have this extra component, it would be built into the teat. So, we designed to that, and then two weeks later, they go, oh, it's fine, we spoke to the patents office and we can get away with it. So as long as we justified decisions, like I say, in terms of the scheduling and stuff, everything kind of fell bang on because we knew what we were doing and when it was gonna be there.   the industrial designer's who's doing the CAD would email his CAD guy, and he was very sort of open, and you could sort of send anything. And if you had a question, it wasn't like, oh we need to try and work out, we don't want to lose faith, it was like, okay, let's get it sorted. Near the end, the district designer came over from Munich, so there was a few culture differences and stuff at first, I mean, I've not been to any other offices. But I get the impression that London's a lot more laid back office than some of the other places
