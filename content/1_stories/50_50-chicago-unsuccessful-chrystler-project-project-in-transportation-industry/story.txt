Text: I'm a verbose person and this other person is not. So when it comes to trying to set the direction for the design, we weren't connecting, and that was really hard for both of us because we both wanted to, and we both wanted to do a good job, and we were both excited about the project, and we just couldn't really find the traction with each other, as it were. Sorry to speak in such jargon, but- Well ... because I didn't have a good working relationship with the Project Manager other practice people came in, so they essentially were ending up making the decisions. So I would say there were two other people, but they weren't resourced on the project. No, I'd say two. I mean, when we got to the ... The project team ended up not really making many decisions. It was okay. We probably should've redesigned the brief to be more inspiring for us because it put us in a `me too` scenario. We were trying to just figure out how to demystify the Nissan Murano and come up with something more exciting for Chrysler, which isn't a powerful position to be in for creative idea. Because we were focusing on the competitor we were looking too much at the competitor, and that wasn't very inspiring. So the inspiration, I believe, at the end of the day, came in through this sort of general sense of the marketplace. You know, what I said earlier. There's the designer's approach and the researcher's approach, and I wouldn't say that the research was particularly inspiring to the design because of the way I briefed it, because it was this: let's compete with this other car. So I was encouraging the team to go and look at other things for inspiration, and that didn't happen because of this communication gap. let's compete with this other car.

It got worse in the next project to the point where there was conflict. I mean, the project went well enough for them to come back, and it was a bigger project the next time, which spoke well for the way that our project was saved, but the client, they nearly came to blows with the Project Manager here. Well, not great because of this communication gap  I think the client's tension fed our team dynamic because we could tell that they were nervous because they're so not risk tolerant. And we didn't set the stage for gaining their confidence and then being able to approach the project the way we did. We approached it in a big defensive way because we fed off of their anxiety, I believe. And we knew better. I remember having a meeting and saying, `This is really more about the brand than it is about the vehicle.` But we decided to follow their brief and I think that set us off on the wrong foot from the start. Mm-hmm (affirmative). Because I think that's the way that they work, generally, and so we felt that, and so we said, `Let's just do what they're asking us for.` But what they were really asking us for was not the words that were coming out of their mouths. What they needed to differentiate this line was something else than what they were asking us. I think that's where we often provide the greatest value: when we work with the client to actually address their needs best.
