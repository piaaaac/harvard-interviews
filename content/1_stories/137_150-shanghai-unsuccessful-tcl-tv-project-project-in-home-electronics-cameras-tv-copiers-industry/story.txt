Text: For example, this is my design, but I have never seen the samples. I never have chance to visit vendor, visit client, this is a problem to me. I like doing that. Let me exaggerate: If you design one thing, you designed it, so that is your baby, you want to see it, you want to see how it is made. I also want to have more communication with client. This is my expertise, I can speak very good Chinese. Maybe if I were to see the client, then your English not so good. [inaudible 00:24:50] But this client, oh this is Chinese company! This is my time, but it can't be, have never visit, I never visit client. This is a problem, to have never visited manufacturing site. Very low. From my experience, it's kind of tight. At the ending phase, it tend to be very tight. No matter in terms of budget or timing. We have to work overtime a lot. But it is normal. The ending phase of a project always, when you are at the ending phase of a project, it is always very busy. The other problem is that, so [inaudible 00:23:27], is a little challenging, to make them is a little bit complicated and takes time. Another problem is ... I don't think I get full respect on this project. My wife always complained about this to me, `You always have full respect, just do it.` I didn't join this project, so I just joined in the middle. I think the ... we have several fractions that made me a little bit stressful, not so happy. I think one problem is client. This is the first time for IDEO to work with TCL, trying this T.V. manufacturer. They not quite understanding our design process and all this change, all this change. Even at the, even almost close to the end of this project, they want, `Oh, I wanna change this appearance. I wanna change the size.` Wow, that is a problem. How do you do that? Yeah, I don't know, and I had very, very, very detailed experience with client. The management structure is I'm forward, I send some feedback to our project leader or someone managing this project, then they forward it to the TCL end, and then they responded to the project leader, then the project leader sends response to me. Why don't let me communicate with them directly? I can do that. I don't think I get enough information from project leaders [inaudible 00:25:19]. About my process. For example, this is my design, but I have never seen the samples. I never have chance to visit vendor, visit client, this is a problem to me. I like doing that. Let me exaggerate: If you design one thing, you designed it, so that is your baby, you want to see it, you want to see how it is made. I also want to have more communication with client. This is my expertise, I can speak very good Chinese. Maybe if I were to see the client, then your English not so good. [inaudible 00:24:50] But this client, oh this is Chinese company! This is my time, but it can't be, have never visit, I never visit client. This is a problem, to have never visited manufacturing site.   I think there ... If the client is more familiar with our design process, maybe the budget and timing are okay, but they aren't. I think this is a problem combined with time, budgeting, client's side. Too many change and to be honest, I did learn something from this project to cooperate with Chinese companies and I think client, on their end, they also missed something. I think one problem is client, client is way harder to deal with, but this may be a very nice one. Just don't fit our design process. I think at the ending phase, yeah, but intermediate stage is not a problem, anyone has seen. We receive too many changes from clients. It made everyone have little bit crazy. The most senior project leader is important.
