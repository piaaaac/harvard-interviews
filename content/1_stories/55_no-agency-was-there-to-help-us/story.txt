Title: No agency was there to help us

----

Text: I went to Aberdeenshire in April to care for my mum who was dying of cancer, it was during lockdown. I spent two weeks trying to get shielding boxes for us. I had no one to take me to nearest town six miles away for essentials and could not leave my mum on her own. I was eventually contacted the day she died saying we could get oneâ€¦no agency was there to help us.
