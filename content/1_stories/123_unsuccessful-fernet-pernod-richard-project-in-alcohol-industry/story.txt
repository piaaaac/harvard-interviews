Title: Unsuccessful Fernet/Pernod Richard Project in Alcohol industry

----

Text: Let me see if I can narrate it properly. Personally, the case was successful for the agency. It wasn’t successful – I mean, it was a case that brought legal problems. It bought me a lot of personal problems because I was focused on that project for a whole month and it practically consumed my life. It was five months ago. It was the second job we did, so we did this one and then we did this one I am telling you about. You clicked on that banner and it took you to the website of the promotion where five friends go to Brazil entering the code of the bottle. It’s the normal and simple promotion but it also had this story that sent people to the website. A lot of people went in, about 100 thousands. It’s a lot here. It’s not a lot outside, but here it is. Petition Online has a ranking, the site where we did the petition, they have a Top 10 of the most viewed and most signed petitions in the world and Alejo’s petition made it to number one. Above the ones about Bush and the whales. After that an anti-blog came out accusing Alejo of lying and trying to unmask the mystery of this blog. The anti-blog was clearly created by Fernet’s competitor to neutralize this move, which had made it to the news, the prime time news. The case of Alejo made it to TV and the two reporters where talking about it and showing the videos and saying, “Let’s help him. We have to sign.” It was crazy and it was all a lie. So at a certain point we were very excited with the idea and then we also started feeling bad because we were lying to a lot of people. That’s why it was very bad and disturbing personally because I even talked about it with my psychologist. I explained the whole case and I said that I felt really bad, that I wanted it all to end and the client was more excited every day because he saw this thing growing but of course it was me answering the mails of the people who was saying, “I’ll support you.” Some people wanted to send money; there were people who wanted to lend us their house in Brazil and I was Alejo and I was answering all their mails. It was terrible. It consumed a month of my life and I had a terrible time because of this guilt. It started as something that was not supposed to explode like this and it did. People really committed to the cause and they supported it and it was all a lie. So for the case this was very tough. It was a very strong exercise that proved a lot of things but the client said, “Well, I am very happy but let’s stop this. I don’t want to talk about this anymore.” We closed it. We collected the 50 thousand signatures. We did a thank you video with Alejo and that was it. We closed it and it went away. Some people wanted to send money; there were people who wanted to lend us their house in Brazil and I was Alejo and I was answering all their mails. It was terrible. It consumed a month of my life and I had a terrible time because of this guilt. The promotion went well, not as well as expected but it was a terrible case. I got mails of people who were telling me, “Look, this guy is trying to collect signatures. Go in a sign.” So it had all turned around and I had gotten an email from a friend from college I hadn’t seen in a long time telling me about Alejo and I had done it. The lie was coming back to me. I was very tense. It was an experiment. We knew it was an experiment but it ended up exploding. There was a trial for false advertising that was resolved and didn’t present more problems but it started very good and it ended up being not good at all. It seems obvious. No, well it was – I mean, that happened where they were very scared and we were very excited and then it turned around. They became very excited to see that it was on TV, their brand and that people were logging in. We were scared because if there were legal problems after that we would have to face them, which was what happened. I don’t know how I am still working and talking with you; I don’t know how they didn’t kick me out but they are very happy over here with that. Jimmy Evans, the regional creative director is going around the countries talking about several cases, this one among them, because it was a very good exercise in regards of media. The client had bought some banners online for a lot of money and the entire thing cost us $1000, and distributing the banners costs $30,000 or $40,000. And a lot more people logged into the Fernet website via the $1000 blog than via the $40,000 banners. So that is a very interesting study. They are spending a lot of money on some banners that don’t have the same result than a story has, which in this case was a lie and I wouldn’t do it again, but it is about an alternative way to drive people to the website. It’s very cheap. So the tolerance was very high. In fact, we said this is an experiment. We don’t know how this will turn out. This may explode or not; maybe nothing will happen. It ended up exploding and that was it. It was regular. Poor. Well, personal stories from friends. The concept, the idea of this Fernet is before anything. So we thought that during the vacations, the best thing is to be with your friend. The target matched that and so we decided to do a trip to Brazil with five friends. But that wasn’t really relevant. In general, the most relevant thing was the blog and Alejo’s case. Alejo is actually one of my closest friends. The actor is one of my closest friends. I would talk to him all the time and he would tell me that he was being recognized all the time in the street, and they would tell him, “You are the guy that can’t go on vacation with his friends.” Terrible. I also got him in a terrible situation. I don’t want to bore you with that but – It was very good. Something very similar to what happened with Halls occurred. We bought Fernet for the meeting and – Fernet is a drink you drink with Coca Cola. You pour Fernet and Coke. We bought Coke and their Fernet and we set up a bar in the meeting room and when they got there, there was music. We served some Fernet and we asked them to serve it because they were the experts. We had ice, Coke, we talked and listened to music and then we started with the presentation, which were some videos we had put together and that were pretty simple to narrate. We told them about the promotion, they liked it, we moved on and from there the blog idea came up and we presented it in another presentation. They liked it and it went pretty well. I was very warm. Yes, we are together and we agreed on how it had all come together. I started getting complicated from the start. They didn’t have a very good relationship with the people from the web department. Apparently the web material – not the blog. I was doing the blog and I didn’t have any intervention from any of the web people. But the people from web didn’t have a very good relationship with the client because they weren’t happy with what had been presented to them, with the aesthetics and the promptness in responding to their orders. The client wanted to see something the next day and they couldn’t do it and neither did they a week after. It was sort of bad. In fact, we won this pitch and the company decided to stop doing pitches and chose us as their permanent agency. Yes. Look, there is a person who works on BTL and always supported the idea of making the blog and also fought for it as we did, which usually doesn’t happen. He insisted and insisted despite the clients fears and it all happened also thanks to him. When the whole legal thing happened, where we didn’t really intervene, he took care of it all. He went to the hearings and talked to the judge. The entire legal matter, with the attorneys and everything, was handled by him, so I can’t say anything about that. es.

Yes, it was an exercise with very good results in one hand and a lot of teachings on the other. We could have taken the actor and used his real name, however we changed it. The actor was called Gonzalo Martinez. John Smith. We could’ve gone with John Smith can’t go on vacation and we didn’t we went with Alejo. So from there – and another mistake, the biggest mistake was that his name was Alejo Castellani, my last name, the creative director of the agency that has that account. A very rookie mistake. It’s just that we had never done it before. he case of Alejo made it to TV and the two reporters where talking about it and showing the videos and saying, “Let’s help him.

Horrible. I consumed me. I had a tough time at home, discussions with my wife. I was nervous, stressed, terrible. We were scared because if there were legal problems after that we would have to face them, which was what happened. I don’t know how I am still working and talking with you; I don’t know how they didn’t kick me out but they are very happy over here with that They did the same brief for all the agencies and nobody had the chance to propose anything else. It was pitch and nobody had the change to discuss it.  I was doing the blog and I didn’t have any intervention from any of the web people. But the people from web didn’t have a very good relationship with the client because they weren’t happy with what had been presented to them, with the aesthetics and the promptness in responding to their orders. The client wanted to see something the next day and they couldn’t do it and neither did they a week after. It happened differently with the web people, they didn’t want to work with them anymore. o from there – and another mistake, the biggest mistake was that his name was Alejo Castellani, my last name, the creative director of the agency that has that account. A very rookie mistake. It’s just that we had never done it before.
