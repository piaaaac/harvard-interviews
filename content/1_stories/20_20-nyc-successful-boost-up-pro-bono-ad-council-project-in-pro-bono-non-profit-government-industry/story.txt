Title: 20 NYC Successful Boost Up (pro-bono)/ad Council Project in Pro-bono/non-profit/government industry

----

Text: It just felt really rewarding and good to be working on something like that and the way that we collaborated, Margie and I were the lead team on it and then there was another team that would help us out whenever we needed help. We collaborated with them a lot in the beginning phases of the project. Boost up. Margie might talk about it also. We started working on that, we were briefed in June and it just finished in December. Because it was pro bono, it was really rewarding. It wasn't like we're trying to sell something to somebody, we're actually trying to keep kids in school and help kids graduate. The whole concept of Boost Up is, the reason why a lot of these kids don't graduate is because they don't have enough support from their friends or their family or from teachers. If they just had someone giving a little encouragement, a little boost just saying, you can do it, you should graduate, that's all it takes is just a little bit of encouragement, a little bit of a boost to help these kids graduate. It just felt really rewarding and good to be working on something like that and the way that we collaborated, Margie and I were the lead team on it and then there was another team that would help us out whenever we needed help. We collaborated with them a lot in the beginning phases of the project. My partner and I were working on every single aspect of it so it was pretty huge. What happened to the project, it ended up being a lucky thing, we had a creative director on the project and as we were shooting the TV spots, he announced that he was leaving the company and going to another job. He left and another guy took over and then a week or two later that guy was like, I'm leaving and he went to another job. A lot of it was just me and Margie and this other team. We need to make these decisions and let's make them and getting things done. We had a great producer and he was organizing everything and making sure everything was happening on time and on task. There was a core group of us so we are making the decisions and things had to go through this or that person at some level and we had to get approval from Ad Council for everything. As far as internally, it was a really small group of us, which was good. We found that because we cared about this project soo much we didn't want too many hands to touch it. It was like well if we don't tell too many people that we are working on this, we just lay low and keep working on it then we will protect the integrity of the idea. Sometimes it makes more sense to have more hands in the pie but for this project we need to make sure we keep this amongst these people. So it worked out. They had to take a big risk, actually. The Ad Council and the Army as well because last year's campaign they spent a lot of money on TV spots and not very much money on the web so this year we wanted them to spend 80% of the budget on the web and 20% on the TV stuff. Which is a risk for any client to take. The Ad Council, when we were presenting to them, they were like this is groundbreaking for us, we've never done anything like this before. It was huge website so it was a big step for them. I think it was the biggest website project that they've ever been involved in. It was a big deal for for them to take a risk on them. In the beginning the brief was really simple. It was, here's last year's campaign, what can we do with it this year. What they have done in the past was they picked ten kids, ten seniors from around the country and had them document their senior year on video and we sent them a video camera and they'd send us back the videos and then they'd post them online. That was the place that last years campaign ended up. The website was cool. You could watch these kids videos but you couldn't do anything else to interact with them or encourage them or give them a boost. We were like okay this is cool you have these videos but we want to be able to create a website that wasn't as static. Wasn't just sitting there watching videos. Where you could actually interact with the kids and go on their MySpace page or interact with them on Facebook or send them a text message. The budget was small. Since it was pro bono and there wasn't too much of a budget, the web company worked ... we did pay them but they worked at a reduced rate, I think. It was directed and edited by the same people who did it last year. I think we may have paid them something but I'm sure it was probably reduced or something. As far as media, there was absolutely no media budget whatsoever. All the media for the TV spots and for the print was all donated No, it was actually good that we could ... with other clients when they have media bought already, you have to deal with that time frame. It's like it's due now, it's due now. We could bend to that and be flexible and make sure that we had enough time to get the media right instead of just trying to get it out of the door. In this case it really helped us to be able to bend it a little bit. The radio had to be out by a certain time and we got that done on time and the TV as well. I think all the deadlines were pushed a little bit but the web deadline, we extended a lot more than we planned. A lot of it had to do with, lets talk to kids where they already are in ways that they already use. So let's use MySpace, let's use Facebook, lets use texting, lets go on YouTube and so the Boost website sort of works as a hub for all of those other sites. We did pick ten kids again this year and they are posting their videos online but in addition to watching their stories, you can go on their individual pages and leave comments for them or send them an email and it all gets filtered back into the site. So you can see how many emails they've gotten, how many MySpace messages they've gotten, if there's been any video comments on YouTube, how many text messages people have sent them and it's all recorded, visually on the site so you can see who's made a comment where and it's a timeline as well. So you can see how much support this kid has gotten from day one up till now and up to graduation. Yeah, they were building it. Our concept for the website and how it was going to work and all of that stuff was from us. They were cool. We were on the shoot with one main client and she was really nice and helpful. After we would leave meetings at their offices we would come out of it and say, wow, I wish all of our clients were that great and all of our clients were that cool and willing to take risks and that easy. Usually if they brought up any points of contention when we were presenting to them, they were completely valid points and we would agree with them. Yeah, they were very helpful and a lot of their feedback was take it or leave it but here's how we feel about this. We could argue against it or for it and it was very much working together in compromise with them, they were great. A lot of the time it was the four of us sitting in a room talking about it and thinking about what we could do and just spending time on it. I think it helps that we all really cared about it. We were more personally invested in it than if we were making an ad for toilet paper or chips or something. We really wanted to do something and help. Yes, nationally it's running right now actually. The website was the biggest part of it. Since we were talking to teenagers mostly, we wanted to make sure that we were online and that we were in places that they were already communicating with each other. Our website connects to MySpace and Facebook and YouTube and those sites that they're already on. I was a really big process. We worked with another company in San Francisco and they were building the website and we were creative directing them to get it all done. That was months of phone calls and work and all that stuff. We found that because we cared about this project soo much we didn't want too many hands to touch it. It was like well if we don't tell too many people that we are working on this, we just lay low and keep working on it then we will protect the integrity of the idea.

Where you could actually interact with the kids and go on their MySpace page or interact with them on Facebook or send them a text message. We started in June and the website was supposed to launch in September, October to coincide with the beginning of the school year for the kids, but we had to push the website back because we wanted to make sure that, since it was such a huge part, an incredible piece of the project, we wanted to make sure it was right and done well and done the way we wanted it to be done. The website didn't really ... it was technically launched in October but it's grown a lot in the last few months and come into its own in the last couple of months. It really was a six month project. I think all the deadlines were pushed a little bit but the web deadline, we extended a lot more than we planned. t was good. During the entire project we were amazed at how smoothly it was going and how much we liked working on it and how much we liked working with the other team. We all cared about it and we all had a heart for it. We were hoping that it would turn out to be something really cool that we had envisioned that it had. We are all pretty happy about it now.

As far as my relationship with the account people, our account guy was also great and really on top of stuff. He was the main contact for the client. We really just had contact with the client when we went to their office to present to them or speak to them. He had daily contact with them at certain points and he was great and did a good job and we like him.
