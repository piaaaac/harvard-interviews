Title: Unsuccessful Sunsilk/Unilever Project in Beauty industry

----

Text: Yes, yeah. It's clients not really knowing what they what and client being afraid to make decisions and client ... We don't know what the background story was but every time we'd come to them with something, it'd be wrong. Eventually we had just the worst work that you could imagine. We were so disappointed with it but after a while, you could fight the good fight but eventually after two years, you want to get this thing done and so you're willing to just take it and give client something that if you turned on the TV you'd quickly switch it off. But that's the way it goes. You can't win them all. That's another thing, you know? Every couple of months it'd be a new person, a new boss, a new person in charge. That's quite important because that makes a big, big difference. You get these guys that are new on the business and they kind of don't know what to do but they feel the need to push their weight around because they got this position, because they feel they have to, so they start pushing their weight around the wrong directions and making wrong decisions. The brief was two years ago. It's just basically advertise Sun Silk hair straightener or hair relaxer or the whole wrench. It's just pretty broad but then things got changed and they forgot that you have to put in the [inaudible 00:29:34] necessarily and whatever so we had to go back to the drawing board. They wanted to advertise on 8 out of 10 women agree, but legally they can't say that. We were just going back and forth and trying to focus on 8 out of 10 women agree. We made up this idea about this team of women, like a Charlie's Angels, 8 out of 10 women are like this, concept, and scrapped. There's never enough budget. Impossible. It's hardly ever impossible. Client services is very good at that. Clients have got money. Unilever, Kellogg's and Nestle, but timing, that's where we clashed heads again with clients and that. We want to get it done and they want to get it done, but they start blaming us when it goes over time, but we had something that we liked and we thought was right from the beginning. Sometimes they go a big 360 and wasted so much time, or they want to be on air next week but they still can't decide what they want and somehow that's our problem, our mistake. There was no inspiration. There was defensive. There was just reactive decisions make and the inspiration was basically trying to find out what was inside the client's head and what they wanted. There was little time to look for any type of creativity or inspiration. It started off like that but it quickly disappeared. Well, in the way that we were always getting blamed. A big thing was, considering we worked on it for two years, I met with a client in person once. Everything else was on the phone or through client service which also made things difficult. Strategy didn't even really come into it. There's no sense in strategy with a Sunsilk client. They think they know everything.

Can your relaxer give it to you this straight?" That's just kind of clever, trying to be clever copy. There's no real concept in that. The concepts were thrown out the window in the first year, so there's a lot of back and forth with just what they want to show, how big should this font be, what are they trying to say, what does this lady look like, what are the colors going to be.  Think that's probably the main problem. There's no communication and it took two years. These things aren't coincidence. It was me and Ronnie at the time. We weren't nearly as close as Chris and I. Chris and I are two years apart. We're both creative but [inaudible 00:34:38] both guys, we've got more in common. Ronnie has got all the experience in the world, but she's an older lady and I'm a younger guy. We work very well together professionally, but that's more suitable to working at a bank. For creative purposes, it's better to work with somebody who's like you and somebody you can kind of just click with.
