Title: We’ve actually been busier

----

Text: We tried to diversify and see what the needs of the people and the community was, and just changed how we sold fish to make it more accessible to people that was self-isolated and that type of thing. I think if we hadn’t changed anything and just carried on selling the fish the way we were before lockdown, we wouldn’t have been very busy at all. But we’ve actually been busier from the lockdown started, doing deliveries and people coming to pick up fish and that type of thing. A lot of the people now in Shetland are trying to source local produce, whether it’s fish, or beef, or eggs, vegetables, anything—try and get it locally if they can… which is good for the local economy too (Farmerama Radio).
