Title: A connection to this earth

----

Text: I feel very lucky that I have been spending so much time at my allotment over the Covid-19 Lockdown period. Lucky is not really the word, as it took over 6 years of waiting for an allotment, and a lot of hard work tending it, to be able to harvest lovely fresh food. You have to WANT to grow your own food. Some people sadly have no idea how rewarding it is. I grow my own as I prefer home-grown food without air miles, pesticides and chemicals. You can also enjoy super fresh salads! We love having a BBQ at the plot, and cooking freshly picked vegetables... I cook from scratch a lot and shop for ingredients like some ladies shop for clothes. With Brexit looming, increasingly my allotment has also signified food security. We shop locally and support small Leith businesses, but what Covid-19 has taught me is that growing your own food as is good for your mental health as it is for your physical health. It is a connection to this earth. Scotland needs more allotments and more gardening education, we have the space and we should lead by example in the UK.
