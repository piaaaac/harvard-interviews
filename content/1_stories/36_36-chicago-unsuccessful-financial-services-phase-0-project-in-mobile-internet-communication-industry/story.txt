Text: Yeah, sure. This was my first project as I arrived at IDEO, I was moving- This was my first project as I arrived at IDEO, I was moving- And Chicago. I was moving from Europe, so it wasn't my first time in states, but it was my first time moving to the states and everything was new and I needed to find a house, and I only had a mattress in my room, anyways ... I had someone from the other office [inaudible 00:25:20] coming for four weeks with myself, and then later in the process we had a contractor, regional contractor, it was a three month project and what didn't go so well was I wasn't integrated with the company, so I was working by myself most of the time for the first three months. I couldn't reach to other people to ask for help 'cause I didn't know anyone, so I didn't really have integration on the company, and the client wasn't prepared to receive whatever we were working on, so I had someone from the other office [inaudible 00:25:20] coming for four weeks with myself, and then later in the process we had a contractor, regional contractor, it was a three month project and what didn't go so well was I wasn't integrated with the company, so I was working by myself most of the time for the first three months. I couldn't reach to other people to ask for help 'cause I didn't know anyone, so I didn't really have integration on the company, and the client wasn't prepared to receive whatever we were working on, so- And so they did the phase zero projects, and then they did the phase one, and pretty much they keep Idea working because the budget was already allocated and everything was already in place, so let them work, but actually, we don't know what we want to do, so we were going further in details and we had questions and they had no way to answer our questions because they were not even sure they wanted what we were doing And so they did the phase zero projects, and then they did the phase one, and pretty much they keep Idea working because the budget was already allocated and everything was already in place, so let them work, but actually, we don't know what we want to do, so we were going further in details and we had questions and they had no way to answer our questions because they were not even sure they wanted what we were doing. So it's like very frustrating to have client that say, `Well, I just ...` the contact that came to us and followed the project was in their company for a month, so it was just like himself getting up to speed with everything and he was trying to give us answers and to follow ... To guide us according to his own vision, but he didn't have the company backing him up, so they never used whatever we were producing. Finished the project, we delivered, and they just forgot about it, it never became real. I mean, there was the two members and then there was, again, the service leader that would come. It was pretty much the only person that ... In that case because I was so junior and the other guy disappeared, so the project ... The practice leader was the one responsible for the project, and he was making pretty much the decisions. The expectations that the client had was proved that wasn't exactly the expectations that people had, so we tried to follow what the client [inaudible 00:31:31] Yeah, so when it got here we realized how messy it was and that maybe what we were going further wasn't what the client expected in the very beginning with this brief, and we tried to stop the project. It's never very easy thing to stop the project when everything is already in place, the contract, the money is allocated and everything, so I think bureaucracy was stronger here and we keep going into the project even though we knew that we shouldn't be doing, that was ... I was a bit frustrated when he left because we were ... Because of this attempt to stop the project we were late on whatever we needed to produce, so he had on the calendar four weeks expecting it on the end of the four weeks we would be in such a stage of the project and we were not, so I was left with whatever was still needed to do by myself. There was a bit of frustration, but not to him- But to whoever was defining the calendar because it wasn't his fault. The client, the client that came to us and said, `We are losing whatever specialty we had before, we are getting back ... Our competitors getting ahead from us, what can we do to leap frog and become the first ones?` And this was extremely atypical project for IDO, we got this project through ... The CEO of the company was friends with our CEO, so it's like you cannot say no to this project, you really need to do this, although you don't understand anything about financial services. he CEO of the company was friends with our CEO, so it's like you cannot say no to this project, you really need to do this, although you don't understand anything about financial services. PROJECT ID The client, the client that came to us and said, `We are losing whatever specialty we had before, we are getting back ... Our competitors getting ahead from us, what can we do to leap frog and become the first ones?` And this was extremely atypical project for IDO, we got this project through ... T And myself not being a native speaker was even more ... like, I have no idea what in the states financial services are so important, so it was a very high learning curve and it was very interesting because of that. Once we get it we get it and we could speak the normal language and go to the field and interview the people. I need to tell you in the first interviews we did everyone was like, `Well, I think I understood 40 percent of what he said.`  It was wasted because we couldn't understand what people were talking about, right? It was pretty much to get up to speed and then have all the questions, and the relation with the client was extremely good because they were also women, it was really funny, so they were very tolerant and very helpful to explain us all ... Everything we wanted to ask and the terminology, so it was quite funny collaboration and very surprising that they trust us, they really believed that we could do it, even though we were- Everything we wanted to ask and the terminology, so it was quite funny collaboration and very surprising that they trust us They were very confident that we actually were the right people to do the project, and it revealed to be really the case. The two weeks were more dramatic because we really felt it, we are really in the wrong place, and then you spend hours and you read all the articles in the magazines and ... And then you ask yourself, `So where is this [inaudible 00:41:22] in all this and so I think that was the middle ground that we could feel comfortable because we know what we are talking about and you guys can be helped if you do exactly what [Apple 00:43:14] is doing or what Target is doing could apply to your business. Okay, so leap frogging and getting to be better than the others, and what we came back to them and say was, `Listen, what you need is to clean your house and reorganize your offer because it's such a mess. You have pretty much a company made of acquisitions and you are not talking to each other.` So yeah, it became pretty much transformation project together with whatever online tools we were proposing. Yeah, we change a lot. PROJECT ID   I don't know. There is no recipes, you just try to minimize whatever new disturbances can come. I, for example, I had my boyfriend's birthday happening in the same week as we had interviews and my project manager was just like so nervous, so nervous, and scared and I couldn't ... I had no courage to ask her that I needed to fly to Europe to go to his birthday, so I just ... Every time I was about to ask her I thought that, `No, if I'm going to do this she's going to have a heart attack.` So yeah, so [inaudible 00:54:06]
