Title: Successful Gepe (singer)/Insecto (production company) Project in Web Interface/website, Video Ad industry

Text: Exactly and in that case we did it for free and it is a project that went well because everything clicked perfectly. For example we got the wardrobe artists, the photographers and all of the people that worked there, and we were like fifteen, nobody charged any money. And they were people that weren’t just from here, they were from production companies all over. And, why do I believe it was a project that functioned properly? Because I believe that it clicked very well, or the idea came together very well with the execution. In what sense? That there is a certain script, I can write a certain script and when you hand it to someone who is going to direct it, it can end up being anything else. In this case since the person who directed it was my partner, I believed that they way the images were thought of and they way they were filmed were totally coherent with they way they were written. A lot of directors accept working for free because when they worked for paid brands they are a little bit obligated to say things in a certain way to work in a certain way and in those cases they are not. It has to do with the freedom of being able to say what you feel like saying, in that sense. Yes, too much. I mean we filmed it in two days but we have been editing it for four months now. You know that they are not going to accept certain idea and you don’t present it or you don’t even think about it, which is even worse. I believe that a lot of the times it is the most important obstacle for a creative, which is to think with certain or too many rules. I mean your own rules but also the client’s rules and that makes for less creativity in general. If you notice for example the idea for Ford, the one with the suicide, the one we were talking about before, it was an idea that we thought of with Sergio and that at a certain point the general creative director, Leo, at a certain point, I mean he always liked the idea but at a certain time someone who I don’t remember who it was said, “No, they are not going to accept that. In the sense that in this case it is like having a client that completely trusts you and that also trusts that you are going to come up with a solution he can’t think about. So then in that sense I believe that those are the best clients because those are the ones that demand more from one. When you have a client you can easily blame, you become mediocre. Why? Because deep down I say, “This brand always says the same, they treat consumers like idiots” so then I think idiotically so then it is like it doesn’t ask you to think beyond that. When there are clients that do demand you think beyond, they are the best but they are also the toughest ones because you demand a lot more from yourself. He was completely willing to try something new, I mean he trusted us at all times and yes, he was very tolerant, I mean he tolerated everything. I mean there was something like that, first of all to not repeat a project. I believe that in this case the brief in this case had a little to do with, I mean the research had to do with us watching all of his previous videos and we also noticed what he had not done yet. I mean there was something like that, first of all to not repeat a project. Yes of course it had to do a little with, I mean in my case I saw the videos that they had before and like they all exploited the same concept. Imagine that in one song, I am left with one idea from the song, and I just make a video with that idea. What we wanted to do was make a video that not only had to do with that but that also respected in a certain way the different meanings of the lyrics, therefore they are several videos in one video and it is not just a video that parts from one idea, and I believe that this video is new in that sense because from all of hi previous videos none did this. I believe that there was a distinction there. You know that they are not going to accept certain idea and you don’t present it or you don’t even think about it, which is even worse. I believe that a lot of the times it is the most important obstacle for a creative, which is to think with certain or too many rules. When you have a client you can easily blame, you become mediocre. Why? Because deep down I say, “This brand always says the same, they treat consumers like idiots” so then I think idiotically so then it is like it doesn’t ask you to think beyond that.  Well, good, they were good. Also know that we worked, we filmed on a Sunday, just imagine there were people from wardrobe, make up, camera crew, people that for example were in wardrobe, and it was Sunday. So that means that the project really interested them because otherwise they wouldn’t have gone, we didn’t pay them. I mean imagine I don’t know if you had worked all week and on Sunday when you can rest you are going to go all day to the street and film. I mean, if you accept it is because you really find it interesting, and in that sense the relationships were really good, we had an amazing time.
