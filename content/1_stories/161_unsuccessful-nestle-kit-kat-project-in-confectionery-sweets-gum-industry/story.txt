Title: Unsuccessful Nestle/Kit Kat Project in Confectionery/sweets/gum industry

----

Text: I think there were several key issues and this one was the expectation of what was achievable at the beginning and sort of when it first came to us, it was, you know, you can do anything and the reality was much further when we went into the initial talks with [inaudible 00:19:02] and when we went to the brief and everything, it was like, “Oh we need a 360 idea”. Where the client's expectation was to do just do couple outdoor posters ... Barely even that. It was more almost like point of sale, they wanna see a massive shot of chocolate bar. It was a really, really narrow minded point of view where we were sold in on actually something much broader that we've been doing. And basically what we come to find out is that we're targeting young males, so we came about all these different ways of actually going about it but in the end, what the client really wanted was half naked women and that was the perv power, so that had to stop and power although we were looking at the market, and it was almost a divide between like a 60-40 split between women and men in the target but it was all sort of young guys and like a more senior older guy on the business. And so, then there's food porn, which is we wanna see the product and we want it to be massive. So, something that started as, “Alright, we need a brand idea and we need something in order to kind of have a platform for consumers to interact and kind of hit them across multiple touch points” turned into how do we incorporate the beautiful woman in a scantily clad outfit and a massive shot of the product. So, once we kind of got over that hurdle and said, “Alright, well”, it was break the boredom, was the idea that we had and it was girls with power tools cutting the bars or drilling into the bars and being sprayed with chocolate or that sort of shit. So, we went down that road and every time we would go down that road with the client, they kept pushing back and being like, “The dresses need to cover up, we need to do this”. And it just turned into real- it was a really interesting experience and once we finally got the photographer in, they ended up being pretty amazing shots and the client just continued not to listen to us and just asking us to make the product bigger and bigger and bigger. So, it became just the biggest shot you've ever seen a candy bar and a girl who doesn't actually fit into- so she was half the size of the candy bar, standing next to it. In the end it didn't really end up being very useful, no. Cause' the initial work that went off that was on strategy and was on answered that single-minded proposition but then where we ended up was had nothing to do with that, so I guess the brief sort of went out the window, probably about half way through the project. I think the creative team- everybody kind of- the creative department sort of handled it as best as they could and I think the accounts service handled it as well as they could as well but it sort of out of our control and although I would say that you'd want account service to be driving that and really bringing the client back in, they were such an unwavering client that I can't really blame accounts service. It was just sort of one of those situations that ends up happening in advertising where you just have to ride it and try to do your best to get to a good result. But it will always be compromised, so you just try to get to the other end of it. I think there were several key issues and this one was the expectation of what was achievable at the beginning and sort of when it first came to us, So what they initially asked for the two [inaudible 00:19:45] of the brand that they were asking for was perv power and food porn. So, coming into this, it was a little like, “Well what the hell is that?” So, that's where their head space was at and ours was like, “Well here's an opportunity to do something really clever” and we didn't think we had to go down a more base. So, then what ended up happening with the project is we compromised on that and everything continually kept being compromised and we still tried to steer away from being cliché and we still wanted to try to target the female market as much as the male, so [inaudible 00:21:49] said, “Alright, we'll try to do it like if Gwen Stefani design clothes for these girls, what would it be and how do you make them really cool, like space age stuff so it isn't just really cliché”. So, it became just the biggest shot you've ever seen a candy bar and a girl who doesn't actually fit into- so she was half the size of the candy bar, standing next to it. Strained. They didn't really listen very well. So, there'd be things where we were talking about design or we were talking about hierarchy, things that we're actually specialists in and it was just sort of like, “Yeah, but make it bigger or we don't care, make the background red”. There was just zero listening.  it sort of out of our control and although I would say that you'd want account service to be driving that and really bringing the client back in, they were such an unwavering client that I can't really blame accounts service. It was just sort of one of those situations that ends up happening in advertising where you just have to ride it and try to do your best to get to a good result.
