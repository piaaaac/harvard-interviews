Title: Successful Wrigley packaging mint flavor (add water) Project in Health/wellness industry

----

Text: We basically first step, generating new ideas, new shape, and the new behavior. Imagine how people, they use those dispensers to drop the ball into their water. We generate three ideas and we quickly finish the design for an inside mechanism and then we build the prototype. Not only the function, not prototype, but also build prototype which looks like real products and also works like real product. It's a really, really fast turnaround. I mean, designing class [inaudible 00:12:19] model making totally withstand two weeks. Really, I have a quick turn around project, and we really enjoy this quick generating ideas and making prototypes. This project, it's more like an idealization project. It's about IDEO designing something to give them inspiration. The design we did it, doesn't mean that's the design finally came to the market. It's more like we design something, give them inspiration. They may hire somebody else to finish the final design. They may change the shape, or behavior [inaudible 00:14:44]. It's a fun little project. Small. Part of the reason I really enjoy this is if the project is really long it's exhausting, which I don't like. I always wanna try something new, a quick turnaround. That, and new tasks. The clients is mature. They already hold a really strong position in the market to dare to try something new and fail. Those kind of clients that they got, definitely higher tolerance of fear, the risk. For example, some bigger client like PMG, or HP, I mean, they definitely, they are able to lose some money if the innovation project didn't turn out to be a good result. For some small client, especially a startup, the way I heard is the American company, or a Chinese company. Maybe especially Chinese company, because they don't really have much money and then they wanna see some short term, what's the word, short term, like benefit. It definitely have rely, rely tolerance of risk to something bad. Okay, for this kind of client, 'cause I recently just experience a really bad project experience, 'cause I was managing a project dealing with local clients. Working with IDEO mean a big investment for the [inaudible 00:17:48]. A small amount of money. It's like small project idea, before that it's a big project. It's like ever biggest project for them, before we work with some Italian and Hong Kong design firms, which they spend like US $10,000 to get like 10 designs. This time they can try to, they spend like US $100,000. They basically will get to [inaudible 00:18:26]. This big, big, huge investment for them. That's the reason they really have high expectations of IDEO. What's frustrating is the design would give them, they're not satisfied with, they're really frustrated with. They get pissed off. They said, "Oh, yeah. I spend so much money with which I can get maybe hundred design from local design firms." Okay, for this kind of client, 'cause I recently just experience a really bad project experience, 'cause I was managing a project dealing with local clients. Working with IDEO mean a big investment for the [inaudible 00:17:48]. A small amount of money. It's like small project idea, before that it's a big project. It's like ever biggest project for them, before we work with some Italian and Hong Kong design firms, which they spend like US $10,000 to get like 10 designs.

They said, "Oh, yeah. I spend so much money with which I can get maybe hundred design from local design firms." I mean, they really, really have lower tolerance. The reason they spend so much money, so that raise up their expectation a lot. They wanna do something better. I mean, the design we give them doesn't have to be a bad design, but from their perspective it doesn't really see the value. Maybe they still see the value, but they doesn't see the value as much as they spent. Just because, the really, really, high expectation. They don't want the design to be a failure in the market. They spend like $10,000, maybe they can tolerate to that. I mean, it depends on size and how mature the client is, and how much they willing to pay. It's quite limited. When you think about that, it's like two weeks projects are three people. Budget definitely limited. Also, it's a- It's more like a collective decision making process. Three of us, we are all engineers and just review design together and make collective decision. If it's like [inaudible 00:15:59] a question, it's hard to answer, because everybody's opinion in terms of [inaudible 00:16:04], it's like a subject of it's an engineering, solution, it's easier to make decision if it works, or not. You know what I mean? You get credits and credibility. Yeah, that's a really positive experience to me, 'cause that's kind of my really, really first project. Second, or third, that's the first, I think, started to experience this idea process, quick prototyping, quick idea generation. Generating ideas as quickly as possible, a whole new point of view, that whole new strong point of view [inaudible 00:13:21]. Come to conclusion as soon as possible, but don't get into your whole idea too deep, otherwise, you'll look at issue from different perspective. It's all about generating ideas quickly, but also still keep your mind open. Also making a prototype quickly to prove your idea. It's a totally new experience to me. Okay. Actually, we over delivered. I think, 'cause I mentioned it's ideation, inspiration, I didn't want a final design. They want something like to use a starting point to generate more ideas. We not only finished the designing of the shape, and the mechanism, we also did the final prototype which look just like real products. I mean, it's definitely over deliver. Oh, it's quite good. It was good. I mean the reason it's really simple, 'cause it's really, really beginning of my IDEO career, and for the other Chinese guy who are, and that's like a new experience for us to work together. Also, quite like a brand new experience working with the American engineer Dana, 'cause it's a new experience, it's a [inaudible 00:24:36] interesting by each other, and given the short period of time of this project, I just feel we didn't enough chance to offend a few members, or get offended back our team members. Imagine how people, they use those dispensers to drop the ball into their water. We generate three ideas and we quickly finish the design for an inside mechanism and then we build the prototype. Not only the function, not prototype, but also build prototype which looks like real products and also works like real product. It's a really, really fast turnaround. I mean, designing class [inaudible 00:12:19] model making totally withstand two weeks.

It's more like we design something, give them inspiration. They may hire somebody else to finish the final design. They may change the shape, or behavior [inaudible 00:14:44]. It's a fun little project. The reason I feel excited about that is the outcome is good. Our internal client, I mean the guys in San Francisco office. They were really impressed by the work we did. I mean, for the client to like to work you did, of course you're happy.  Okay. As for staff week, we'll one hour to buy some similar products for inspiration, for reference, 'cause I'm never design something similar before. I have to see what's out on market, where I can get inspiration or starting point of inspiration ideation. We went out to buy some existing products. We just sit together, quick stretches, exchange ideas, get inspired from each other. Also do some web search, see if there are any similar application out there on the market. Just think about that, draw something, and refine your designs. It's quite intuitive, complex process.
