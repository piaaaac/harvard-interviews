Text: Half a year have passed, but nothing is yet clear. I don't actually like it, because so much work is done, but I don't see the outcome, the result. I'm still in for some other indefinite work. So they don't what they want me to do, I don't know what they want me to do again, or as well. Sometimes it all comes from the global way to some details, to the way that we come to presentations, and we find that there's some misunderstanding because the managers did not understand each other. Or the managers from their side may have sent something to our managers, which they didn't accept, or didn't find relevant to ... Didn't find necessary to tell us. You know, this project, and this client just takes away the powers from me, and it takes so much time. I still don't know if there will be any advertising campaign next year. Maybe it's just a waste of time, and we ... Maybe you know, we live in Russia in some kind of isolation. We still think that every agency of the world is Alliance winner, and all the people around the world are so creative and bright, and only we are dumb and our clients are dumb, and scary. Now we know that the situation is a bit different. Within the agency? Oh, again, every time there's a new number of people. We have at least two people from managers department, from account department. We have a person from the strategic department. Something like that. that No, to the market it's quite okay with the market, but they are not quite okay with the way we think. You know, considering yourself a creative person makes you think that you may think for somebody else, or you may create something really interesting, outstanding. Something bright, original, all sort of things. When I come to presentation I know that they will not understand those originality, brightness, blah, blah, blah, all those aspects that makes my idea nice. Just one simple, [inaudible 00:40:36] and that's it. So I can understand that, so it doesn't offend anybody, older audience, for example. The time is okay, because we started to work in the beginning of the year. Now half a year have passed, and we are still, for nothing, we still with nothing we have to go with, so we are pressed for time right now. I'm at a loss every time we present. So okay, they look at me, `Okay, uh-huh.` They're nodding their heads, `Uh-huh, mm-hmm (affirmative). That's okay, uh-huh. Just omit that nice thing at the end, and we'll approve that.` But that's the gist. I cannot just remove it, because ... `But you know with this thing, it sounds a little bit dangerous, it may ... No, just rewrite it without that.` So I find myself starting writing things just automatically, just for quantity. Maybe this will come through, maybe this one. Actually we made a TV scene, we shot it in January. Even the script they were being not quite bright, but still had some joke. Even that joke, was eliminated and reduced to nothing, and I cannot put the TV scene to my portfolio. Though the client is happy. That's okay, we have a nice results. Again, the situation and the difference of JWT Moscow, or from other JWT offices, I don't know, or from other agencies, is that so many relationships go through one person, through one definite man, Ivan Chimburov, Chief Creative Officer. He acts as a copywriter, as a creative person. He acts as an account manager, though he doesn't make any calls, or he doesn't type documents. But still he communicates with executives on the client side, maybe that's the ... It's different because actually there was a quite nice planning department work in the beginning. But you know, when the client doesn't know what they want to have, just do so many parts of work, we're just thrown to a trash basked and ... Every time we start working, we just try to guess. So every trial is a guess. Perhaps they will like this, perhaps they will like that. Perhaps they need this. They don't know what they need. We may try to guess. Well we have feedbacks every week. Well not every week, maybe every two weeks. But it's the feedback for what you've done last month. ... absolutely the opposite to the first one, because the girl there who sends the letter, she just really collects them and makes a list, without thinking what the comments are about. I'm still in for some other indefinite work. So they don't what they want me to do, I don't know what they want me to do again, or as well. Sometimes it all comes from the global way to some details, to the way that we come to presentations, and we find that there's some misunderstanding because the managers did not understand each other. and only we are dumb and our clients are dumb, and scary. Now we know that the situation is a bit different. They come together, five persons or six persons, they start arguing between themselves. Blah, blah, blah, by the way, why didn't you do that? Why the hell didn't you do that? We told you about it, I told you. He told something to me different, why should it ... Okay. No, they are very, I would say that they're very afraid of doing something, though the product is for young people, for younger audience, they themselves are not that tolerant to risks as young people. I would say that they're not understanding to what? To ... You know, considering yourself a creative person makes you think that you may think for somebody else, or you may create something really interesting, outstanding. Something bright, original, all sort of things. When I come to presentation I know that they will not understand those originality, brightness, m at a loss every time we present. So okay, they look at me, `Okay, uh-huh.` They're nodding their heads, `Uh-huh, mm-hmm (affirmative). That's okay, uh-huh. Just omit that nice thing at the end, and we'll approve that.` But that's the gist. I cannot just remove it, because ... `But you know with this thing, it sounds a little bit dangerous, it may ...

Sometimes our account managers cannot do anything without him, they just don't train, don't try it, or if they [inaudible 00:45:24] right, they cannot estimate the results of their communication. They just still need him to tell what they should do next, or what we should do next. Perhaps they will like this, perhaps they will like that. Perhaps they need this. They don't know what they need. We may try to guess. No, it's more useful to talk with them when they come here, than when they write something. Because they collect comments from every person, and every often these comments contradict each other. So they see one point is this, and the last point is-
