Title: We are upbeat

----

Text: The current coronavirus pandemic has hugely impacted our business. Most of our asparagus had been presold to restaurants so we had to pivot to new markets. Luckily the response from small independent retailers has been amazing! We hope that these new routes will remain an outlet once the restaurants reopen. Itâ€™s not yet clear what the financial impact on our bottom line will be as we are just going into the season now but we are upbeat. Later in the year when our goat meat season starts, we may face a similar issue but we have already had a number of inquiries so we are hopeful that it restaurants have not reopened we can find new local markets.
