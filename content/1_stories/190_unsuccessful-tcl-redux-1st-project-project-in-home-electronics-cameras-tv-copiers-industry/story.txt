Title: Unsuccessful TCL redux (1st project) Project in Home electronics/cameras/TV/copiers industry

----

Text: So, I think that was a big frustration for myself, finding myself like with a very junior team that I was leading here, having a project manager that was in a different location, and then having also, just being overwhelmed a lot by it. And also since we don't really have human factor support here, it really feels, I'm the most- like with Joan out, on her rotation, we're really like the most senior HF people here and I mean, we're like high 2, whatever that means. And fortunately we had some more HF sketched into the project for the synthesis part and that was really helpful, because otherwise it would have been really painful. But with that project, was a lot about people's competencies, and how some people were like, "Yeah, we can pull it off." It was a lot about showing office pride, I found. It takes time, and also [inaudible 00:04:41] wasn't quite like ... I think everybody had a hard time with that project, and there were so many expectations, fortunately it developed well, we have a strong relationship with TCL now, but it was hard in that way. But again, because the money here has more value, so people who were put on the team were put there to be coached, and that is always an issue. You can't have an aggressive schedule and then put people on that need coaching. You want people who can do the job Oh, on the client's side, well, there's the top guy, but he's such a- I mean that's another thing. Chinese companies, the decision makers are not as obvious, so you could almost say there was a whole bunch of them. But like the top guy, I think he made most of the decisions for that one. Um, I think the budget was ... because, again, the project amount was just of so much more value here, so the budget was not that much for that kind of project, but because it just lasts longer, so, it felt like well budgeted. I think my relationship was good because I speak Chinese, and I was able to sort of bond with them quite well. I felt that in general, this whole language thing is just such a divide, and people are dependent on the translator and Vivian. I mean obviously the relationship is there, otherwise we wouldn't have future work, but ... It didn't feel like, "Hey we're in the room together to create something new." It was more like, "Hey you, you're in our space now. Do something. Increase our sales, for example. Do something beautiful." And it maybe didn't feel like they wanted to be engaged. For example the kitchen project I was on, people were actually more open to a creative process, but with them, no. But that's also maybe because, you know I grew up without TV, I never owned a TV. I have a TV in my apartment because my landlord doesn't want to move it out of my apartment, so, it was like a project where I was totally lacking a connection to it. So there was many more layers put on top of that project than just designing a TV ad [inaudible 00:03:50]. At the same time, it was my first project that I did here in Shanghai after moving here. It just felt that- actually, that's not true. There was an HF rotator here, but she's never coached a project. You have to have coaching experience in order to know what is helpful to those guys that are stuck in a room and dream about that project. Five? The core team and then obviously it gets then handed over to different phases, and then people more or less. I think another issue was too many undefined roles. I think time was, it was almost a bit too much time there, but not enough support. That was Redux, the first TV that signed for them. I felt that that was like a typical thing what happens in the Shanghai office, with on the one hand having project managers sitting in Palo Alto, the team being here. It was the first project that was running out of the office as big as it was, and also with lots of time and research. And I think the other problem was that people were just thinking, "Of course we can do it." And nobody was thinking, "Yes, with a junior team you can do it in other locations where you have senior coaches that check in, see how it's going, and then give you feedback and have a project manager on board." But with that project, was a lot about people's competencies, and how some people were like, "Yeah, we can pull it off." It was a lot about showing office pride, I found.  So it really felt like not being supported, and at the same time it felt like expectations were high, it felt like various people breathing down our necks, coming back from an observation. "So what are the top insights?" And you're like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, hang on, let me ..." No, not that many. I was- but it just felt like, there was a project manager, and there were the three location, no, it was one of them- the other two people were running the location, BD, yeah, that was for example, a project where I didn't feel that I was involved in the decision making process. I was giving my point of view, but I didn't feel like the other project where I felt it was very successful. I think my relationship was good because I speak Chinese, and I was able to sort of bond with them quite well. I felt that in general, this whole language thing is just such a divide, and people are dependent on the translator and Vivian. It didn't feel like, "Hey we're in the room together to create something new." It was more like, "Hey you, you're in our space now. Do something. Increase our sales, for example. Do something beautiful." And it maybe didn't feel like they wanted to be engaged. For example the kitchen project I was on, people were actually more open to a creative process, but with them, no. But we're not people who have seen 1,000 projects and actually look at them and say, "Hey guys you need to change A, B and C and then you're done" sort of thing. We look at it and we're like, Okay that's another three days work." Obviously we're in a very different level which is normal, because we're not in our forties or anything, in our late thirties, but it sounds like that was lacking. It was more about this project is a good chance to get to know what's going on in people's homes, so Christine and me were more like excited about, "Hey, we're learning so much about what people put in their living room versus their bedroom, and the bathroom, and whatsoever." So it was really more like a in-depth study of people's homes. But it didn't really feel like, like for me it wasn't inspirational.
