Title: Unsuccessful JWT credentials booklet Project in Advertising/research/internal industry

Text: First off, it was just make this one look better, so I guess at first the goals weren't 100% clear because then it got bigger, and then it got bigger, and then we met with the directors of the company... sorry the CEO and the MD from here and the creative director who was different at the time, and all of a sudden it was like... because it got bigger and they saw the ideas that I was putting forward and they said yes money is no expense here, no problem and more and more and more and blah blah blah. That's when it started going horrible by involving all those people and starting... the CEO at the time was a real yeah let's do that, but I like this. I gave them three ideas and she liked all three. I want to combine all of them, I want to do them all, you know what I mean? So it was combining things that didn't really need to be combined and it made it difficult. Do our credentials, make them look better. So in the end I gave them concepts for not just making it look better, because they changed... after they gave me the first brief, then they gave me another. They just kept going like this, so in the end the CEO had this new idea for a different kind of deal, so we went along that line and she saw what I did and she wanted to include that in her concept and make it so anyways, it just got bigger and bigger. So sorry what was the question on this? So it seemed useful and certainly I got to do what I wanted, and in the end it didn't really veer from what I wanted to do, but they put in so many different things and then it just became too big, they wanted too big and no one would sign off on it in the end, so that's probably another question. Good, yeah. As much as there was animosity, especially near the long end of it, it went on for months. So near the end, I was just getting... it would just keep coming back and someone would send it to Melbourne and some secretary wouldn't like it. So it was getting frustrating, and I[inaudible 00:17:57], but it was good, everyone gets along. That's when it started going horrible by involving all those people and starting... the CEO at the time was a real yeah let's do that, but I like this. I gave them three ideas and she liked all three. I want to combine all of them, I want to do them all, you know what I mean? So it was combining things that didn't really need to be combined and it made it difficult. First off, it was just make this one look better, so I guess at first the goals weren't 100% clear because then it got bigger, and then it got bigger, and then we met with the directors of the company It probably came in where suits started... because it was for them to sell the company to other businesses, I guess they felt a need for authorship by it, whereas in the end I feel like they should leave it for us to do, and then maybe make little things in the end. But they became the worse client I've ever... I worked on that thing for- Like as in where everyone had... because not only were we doing it for us, but it was for all of the Austral Asia, Australian New Zealand, so you'd have people in Melbourne making a say on certain things, people in New Zealand, and people here. Do you want me to get really dramatic and say well 14 people.  then it just became too big, they wanted too big and no one would sign off on it in the end, so that's probably another question. There was... As this... As it's off the record, as far as anything I've done, just the creative director at the time just wouldn't, he just let the circus sort of go on, and I was just walked into the agency and I got in the middle of this circus, he should have put his foot down a little bit and told the CEO and the MB to back off a little bit and just let us do our business.
