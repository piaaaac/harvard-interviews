Title: Giving ownership back

----

Text: It’s important to help people to understand that good food is this tree off of sustainability, in terms of, you know, ecology, health, and, and social. Doing that in a way that that that really engages people with where food comes from, you know, it's only a generation since we really lost our connection to all of this. And perhaps, you know, that that idea of giving ownership back to some of the indigenous food cultures across Scotland, so, but it’s this idea of good food not being seen as something elitist, and I'm making that very explicit in a right to food strategy, that it's right to good food. You made the point about junk food and that is a danger that, you know, as we slip into what looks increasingly like a no-deal Brexit, any food is going to be what people are aspiring to. So, saying from the off that it's not just about the right to food rate or having a full belly – it’s good food. We're saying we explicitly that it's a good food nation, it's a good food nation Bill.
