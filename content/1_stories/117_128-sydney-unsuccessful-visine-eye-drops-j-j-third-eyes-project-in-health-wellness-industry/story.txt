Title: 128 SYDNEY Unsuccessful Visine eye drops /J&J (Third Eyes) Project in Health/wellness industry

Text: So essentially the idea was, if you're going to stare at this small... your eyes are going to start playing tricks, and that was the crux of the campaign, which would have been really cool to do, but just like TV stuff, or this guy sitting there typing late at night and staring at the fan for a second, and then suddenly the fan breaks off and spins around like it's a little flying saucer and it's going to land on the desk and two dudes get out and steal an orange and an apple and go back in and fly back up, and he's looking up, or you don't know that's a fan at the beginning and it just lands and goes back down and goes in the fan and he's just, like 'What the fuck?' But the whole idea, the big thought and could have gone anywhere basically. We had it, what we thought was all sorted, we went in there with a recommendation and it was just not enough about the product benefit, and they didn't believe us that tired eyes can play tricks. But maybe because it had aliens in it. But I think the reason it probably bombed is because it wasn't close enough to the facts they wanted to get across, it was making an interesting ad to get people into that fact rather than using that fact to drive someone into the ad, which can often be quite boring and dull. There is a client there called Sanda, who didn't like it. Back to the drawing board. We presented one once that was, 'Listerine brings you to life.' It had these clowns, and it was all about pouring... this kid pours this Listerine in this clown's mouth, at the sideshow at the carnival. You know those clowns that have the [inaudible 00:07:01] but there's four of them attached together, and they all wake up and started walking around as four of them. And before he even finishes, it was like, `Oh, no, I don't like clowns.` Sorry? `I don't like clowns.` Yeah, if I don't like clowns, lots of others do, I don't like clowns.` I think, I've obviously heard, whether, for people, will they find it interesting enough, because we are just telling them something new, or do we have to do something to engage their attention to tell them something new. In this case, I don't know That one we came up with, I think, because we were working quite late on it. It's kind of cool when you are working on something and living what that product benefit could be. Because we had been at the office quite late and we were, 'my eyes are fucking with me.' That's quite interesting, because when you stare at your computer that long, you're going to start making mistakes, and you're going to start wondering if your brains start drifting off a bit. So I think that's one of those ones where it happens to you, I guess, very often [inaudible 00:10:59] They are all right. I'm quite friendly with a couple of them there. This one lady we didn't get along with her too well, it feels very 'us and them' sometimes, with J&J. I don't feel like they feel that we're helping them, rather we're trying to slip something [inaudible 00:11:21] under the radar. I don't really feel like that can go hand in hand. I want a client that laughs and goes, 'Oh it's great, I love it, but we'll never do it because they'd be too scared.' It's like, personally, it's really cool, but I'm representing the big company and that's not what we do. But Stan's cool. I don't really feel like that can go hand in hand.

It was a bit, I think it's been a new Creative Director's style, so there was more, a bit of 'trying to impress these guys' this is always how that works. You don't know how they play, and what kind of people they are, so you're trying to, through the credit reviews, trying to suss it out what you think is good or not, and then not exactly doing what you would think would be great, but trying to mold it to what their expectations would be. So especially when you have four Credit Directors or lots of Credit Directors in two years, so you've got to impress them every time they come through. `Oh, no, I don't like clowns.` Sorry? `I don't like clowns.` Yeah, if I don't like clowns, lots of others do, I don't like clowns.` Too many. There would have been three or four. A local client. And then I think with J&J how it usually goes, it goes up to a regional client and then up to the big cheese who, they run it across his desk, if it's gone through everyone else, and if he's in a bad mood he just goes, 'No.' That's how it kind of works with them, I gather.   'my eyes are fucking with me.' That's quite interesting, because when you stare at your computer that long, you're going to start making mistakes, and you're going to start wondering if your brains start drifting off a bit.

They're good. As far as the Account Service goes here, they are one of the better teams. Their boss is really good, it's not a matter of, 'we've got to please the client,' it's like 'give me what you want to give and I'll find a way to sell it,' which is great, I think. Obviously, you are [inaudible 00:13:10] that thinks you've come up with a problem, didn't tell certain clowns, but he's good, he's really good, I get along with him very well.
