Title: 57 CHICAGO Unsuccessful Mcdonald's  Project in Food industry

----

Text: No, they cook the eggs there, which is ... I didn't know that either, but they do a lot of that. And it's like well, you guys hide everything, and you guys are so fast and efficient, and McDonald's is one of the most efficient fast-food places. They're way beyond anybody else as far as exploring how to be as efficient and simple as possible. So, this project was a build at the innovation center at McDonald's, and in theory, there was one project lead, but for some reason there seemed to be two different people trying to make the same decisions, trying to answer the same questions. So, I would go up to one of them and say, `How do you want this to look?` or `What are you thinking as far as getting this done or this?`, ask him a question. He would say one thing, and then the other person would come up and say, `Don't listen to him. Do it this way.` And, the one project leader, A, was constantly questioning me on how I was building things to the point where they actually made fun of a couple ways I built things.

Do it this way.` And, the one project leader, A, was constantly questioning me on how I was building things to the point where they actually made fun of a couple ways I built things. Which, then after it was built they realized why I did it that way, and in fact, the CEOs of McDonald's saw how I was doing it and thought it was incredibly smart because they didn't even know the direction of their design when I was building this, yet we had a deadline This one specific thing was that they wanted to have ... They wanted to do something like the counters more or less in a circular configuration, so if you imagine a round counter with multiple stations. And then above it, there was this header that was also echoing same size going around the top, and they wanted ... Well, they didn't know what they wanted because they were constantly arguing. One of them wanted to be able to project from a projector onto the surface of this facet, this façade, images. Then they wanted to project it from behind. Then they wanted to put stickers on it. Then they didn't want to do anything. And so oddly enough, my friend from California was also out for that project because he does a lot of stage design, so he and I were like how are you going to make something that either is going to get projected from the back, from the front, stickers on it? They don't know how far off the ground they want it, or far off the ceiling because they wanted it to float there. How are you going to solve all these problems and start building something because our deadline's in two weeks?  He's like, `What are you building?` I'm like I'm trying to explain it and just finally I was like, `You know what, fuck you.` This was in Romeoville, which is a two hour drive. It was costing me $15.00 in tolls. I was working probably 15 hours a day including Saturday. I didn't see my family. And then the other project lead B, she was saying, `Okay, well we need this set up and we need this and this particular configuration.` And she was giving my drawings down to a 16th of an inch for a 75 foot square environment. To a 16th of an inch ... Showed me a complete lack of any kind of intelligence. If you can get within a half a foot, and this is a prototype. It's not going to be used to actually process people. How is she going to measure from the center of a 22 foot diameter ring on the ceiling to the center down and then off of two walls to a 16th of an inch? You can do it, but it's a waste of time and completely unnecessary. That's where knowing what you should do and what you shouldn't do comes into play, learning where you should stop. And project lead B did not understand the tolerances. She didn't live in the real world. I'm like, `Are you serious? A 16th of an ... You know how much a 16th of an inch?` And she still didn't understand, so I basically lied. I'm just like, `Yep, let's do the 16th`, because there's no way she would have been able to measure it anyway. Yeah. It wasn't dealt with formally. I try to be extremely tolerant and understanding of people, so I try and give everybody a benefit of a doubt. I always ... They make a mistake, no big deal. We all make mistakes, but if you're constantly making mistakes and you're supposed to be a project lead there's something seriously wrong. Project leads make mistakes all the time. It's whether they admit it, whether they correct it are the strong attributes to being a good project lead. If a project lead doesn't make mistakes you're not looking close enough, and it's to be expected. Everybody makes mistakes. But as far as formally dealing with it, I don't know how they formally dealt with it. I tried to distance myself as much as possible.

If a project lead doesn't make mistakes you're not looking close enough, and it's to be expected. Everybody makes mistakes. Yeah. It wasn't dealt with formally. I couldn't even do my job because ... And they had unrealistic time schedules like, `Hey you can build this kitchen in, I don't know, two days. Is that alright?` And they wanted 2x4 frame member structure. And both Mike and I are like, `We build sets all the time.` We used to. I used to work in California building sets and models and stuff. I said, `You only need 1x3's or smaller because you're just skinning the stuff. It's just a picture. It's an experience that you can walk around. You can put a little weight on it for a cash register or whatever, but we're not designing the thing to actually be manufactured. That comes later on in a different phase if they actually were to take this and go with it. But that wasn't even a discussion. That wasn't even a part of it.

That comes later on in a different phase if they actually were to take this and go with it. But that wasn't even a discussion. That wasn't even a part of it. Yeah. We've worked with McDonald's quite a bit, so they knew us. They knew our quality. They knew our creativity and they like the way we innovate and come up with new ideas. So, it, I would say, it was probably not a risky project at all because they weren't going to implement it. Don't listen to him. Do it this way.` And, the one project leader, A, was constantly questioning me on how I was building things to the point where they actually made fun of a couple ways I built things.

One of them wanted to be able to project from a projector onto the surface of this facet, this façade, images. And so, we went to the hardware store, and we're looking around. Well, maybe PVC. No, that's too flexible, blah blah blah, so we just tried thinking why don't we use copper pipe? Copper pipe we can solder together. We can make two tracks on the top. We can connect them with couplings in between, and then when they figure out where they either want to project from the front or the back, we can cut out the copper. We can move those joints. We can eliminate them, but once it's all screwed together, it should be a nice rigid yet light structure. Well, we started doing that, and we started bending the pipes and stuff, and we had stuff laid out. And one of the project leader A started laughing, saying that it looked like a train track. He's like, `What are you building?` I'm like I'm trying to explain it and just finally I was like, `You know what, fuck you.` Because I was just ... At that point because I had been working ... This was in Romeoville, which is a two hour drive. It was costing me $15.00 in tolls. I was working probably 15 hours a day including Saturday. I didn't see my family. The guy had no sympathy. And I was completely fed up with it. I was like I'm fighting the project leader so that I can do my job because I know how to do it. If he knew how to do it he should have done it, but nobody on the project team, the design team was actually designing anything. It was just a complete fiasco. How is she going to measure from the center of a 22 foot diameter ring on the ceiling to the center down and then off of two walls to a 16th of an inch? You can do it, but it's a waste of time and completely unnecessary. That's where knowing what you should do and what you shouldn't do comes into play, learning where you should stop. And project lead B did not understand the tolerances. She didn't live in the real world. I'm like, `Are you serious? A 16th of an ... You know how much a 16th of an inch?` And she still didn't understand, so I basically lied. I'm just like, `Yep, let's do the 16th`, because there's no way she would have been able to measure it anyway. Frustrating, yes. Yeah, no there was only one project lead, but between the two they couldn't design anything. They couldn't come up with an answer. I don't know how they formally dealt with it. I tried to distance myself as much as possible. I couldn't even do my job because ... And they had unrealistic time schedules like, `Hey you can build this kitchen in, I don't know, two days. Is that alright?` And they wanted 2x4 frame member structure. And both Mike and I are like, `We build sets all the time.` But he wouldn't listen, and we basically had to go behind his back, go to Home Depot, buy 1x because it was much easier to cut, much easier to nail together, much easier to change when design changes happened.   No, because McDonald's does a lot of projects like this where they're just experimental. I don't even think that they were even ... I don't even think in their mind that they were even going to use this idea no matter what we came up with. It was just an experience that they would have so that they could draw on it later on.
