Title: Interconnectedness of society

----

Text: This crisis has highlighted the interconnectedness of society and the vulnerabilities that are brought about to everyone when our food system is unfit for purpose and we lack adequate safety nets. We need to take this as an opportunity to rethink and properly restructure our food and welfare systems. The right to food and a cash based approach to food poverty have long been spoken about as aims of the Scottish government and now, as we look to “build back better”, more than ever they are necessary. I believe that community projects have a huge role to play in our food systems future, but let us move forward so it is through education and empowerment, building community, and developing local food provision, green space, and food hubs, rather than scrambling about trying to plug holes in our broken food and welfare systems.
