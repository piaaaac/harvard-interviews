Title: Successful Pharmaceutical (health practice) Project in Medical industry

----

Text: Yeah, I think the last one [inaudible 00:16:09] is, I think what was really good about this project was that it was ... it ran out of the health practice, but none of us actually, as a team members, had been exposed to any health practice projects before, so I think that was a really good thing because we had three coaches, and in the [inaudible 00:16:30] three coaches, I was like, "Oh guys, yeah right. What is this gonna be like?" But what it turned out to be was that two people, because it was health practice, but then partly transformation. Are you familiar with transformation? It's basically looking at companies and seeing how they ... it's a bit like change management, but also helping them implement this. For example, now with this project, we actually had ... I think we went okay to 70% in the health practice and 30% in transformations. We had one coach from health, and one from transformation, plus then the BD person to scope the project. I think another thing was that our project manager was very transparent. Hands on, on the one way, kept away everything that was ... that could've distracted the team. She was really building this transparent wall between us and the client, and at the same time, it was transparent, so we actually knew what was going on. I think what was also really adding to this was he was very much reflecting on his own thoughts, and his own feelings towards the project. Alex, who was the third guy, he actually said at some point, "[inaudible 00:18:31] is so gay." Because he's so reflective, and I mean, he's from Spain, so he's like machismo. He was like, "This is so gay." But that really helped because Hans was telling us, "You know what, guys? I'm not feeling good about this, and I'm getting really nervous." Obviously, we were a very mature team, if you tell not that mature people, like very junior people that you are very nervous, I mean, it's sort of like the nervousness spills and it doesn't do any good. But with our team, it was like, we just knew we could pull it off. In that sense, then sharing these feelings was actually really helpful 'cause then some of us could say, "Hans, not at all. We as a team have a really good feeling." He'd go like, "Really?" And then we would talk about it, so we had multilayered conversations about the actual work, about logistics, about stuff that was going on. About how we analyze the client, which is always helpful. Like what is the client's position? Who's our point of contact? Really getting a good idea of how they are internally situated, like their politics. Obviously, we were a very mature team, if you tell not that mature people, like very junior people that you are very nervous, I mean, it's sort of like the nervousness spills and it doesn't do any good.

Like what is the client's position? Who's our point of contact? Really getting a good idea of how they are internally situated, like their politics They really were concepts in the sense of, "Okay, tomorrow your lunches are banned. The day after tomorrow your samples are banned, but hang on, we got some stuff for you here." However, the client was like, "Yeah, I really like that stuff, but my boss, she's not gonna like that." They were like, "You know, we need a bag." That was then the whole discussion with the bag versus scenarios about creating value added services for a sales rep. For example, one idea we had was the sales rep finding out information about diabetes, prediabetes, like where can you buy fresh groceries for a cheap price? Where's a gym that has the best membership and whatever? Free membership with a free pair of trainers, or I don't know what. But to then have the sales rep being like the agent to go out, collect all this information and create a webpage for the doctors. That was one of the ideas. I mean, client loved it. Said like, "Yeah, but my boss, she wants a bag." We were like, "Okay." In the end, I mean, that was like ... I think the success of the project was that we all talked about it. It wasn't just decided by the PM going, "Okay, we need a designer, you design a bag." Obviously, we were a very mature team, if you tell not that mature people, like very junior people that you are very nervous, I mean, it's sort of like the nervousness spills and it doesn't do any good. But with our team, it was like, we just knew we could pull it off. What is at risk for him if we don't give him the bag, you know? To sort of understand what's going on on their side, and then the third layer, to say, okay how are we all feeling about this? Obviously, the client didn't take part in that bit, but it really was about the team. Yeah, so we finished the project and yeah, now they're thinking about implementing in, and internally they shared it with their top guy. And so, it's really ... Yeah, I think it was a very successful project. There are even numbers that, for sales reps, for one week, they don't call in the doctor, the rate drops off prescriptions. There really is part to it, however, we're now in a world where they can't give any presents anymore. They can't take doctors golfing, or [inaudible 00:21:24]. I don't know what. Now it's all reduced to samples, like drug samples, and pens, sticky, like sticky post its. It's becoming a bit ridiculous because the sales reps, they walk into the door, they first have their schmoozing chat with the ... with Sue who sits at the reception and hands the first token to buy access to the room in the back, and the treatment rooms. What are the areas that you can actually, within this highly restricted pharma code, and highly restricted, or this highly volatile situation, how can you actually find out new ways of bringing value? We came up with a couple of ideas in terms of actually supporting the doctors, realized some doctors just had really huge egos, and they really needed sales reps to help them. I mean, there are some weird dynamics going on, especially with older doctors, and also with very young doctors that are taught in med school stay away from the sales reps. They all want to influence you. You have very many different audiences. Yeah, so we came up with a couple of concepts that were actually quite far out. Sometimes they get to see the doctors, and usually doctors were like, "You know what? Good sales reps are people who actually offer a service. But the ones that just shout at me like, 'Aspirin, doctor. Buy aspirin. Prescribe aspirin.', they're just not any use." The idea was, okay ... And the reps also do lunches. What's happening now is that lunches get banned, sales reps get banned and the next thing will be samples will be banned, and what are you gonna do then? Novo Nordisk is a Danish company for insulin, an insulin bio farm manufacturer, and they were like, "You know what? We entered the US market, we just hired another 700 salespeople, so we don't want to get rid of them right away, so let's see what we can do." We went out to understand what is the sales interaction like, and so, what are the opportunity spaces? What was really helpful was that, especially, the guy from the health practice, he was so aware that none of us had a health background, so he would tell the project manager, don't worry about my billing wage, I do the regular check ins for as the coaching, which basically would be like an hour a week or something, or sometimes two hours a week. But then he would say, "You know what? If you have any question about health, I'm happy to stay on longer." I mean, if we had some sessions where we would stay for four hours and we would just pick his brain and go, "Okay, tell us about it. How does it work? What is the [inaudible 00:17:43]? What is the history of insulin? What are the different insulin pens?" Just like questions like this, 'cause none of us had a clue about that. And so, that was really helpful.  But it was more like, "Okay guys, what do you feel? What is the bag standing for? What is it resembling?" At some point, I mean, we could've all killed him because of the bag, because we're all like, "Yes, we need the bag." [inaudible 00:24:46] anymore. But looking back, I think it was just really good 'cause it felt like we were, despite of having different years at IDO, despite of being ... just having different experiences and life experiences, but it really felt like we were all sitting at a table and we were all valued with our opinion. I think that was, for example, for me, what really make this also a successful project. I think another thing was that our project manager was very transparent. Hands on, on the one way, kept away everything that was ... that could've distracted the team. She was really building this transparent wall between us and the client, and at the same time, it was transparent, so we actually knew what was going on. I think what was also really adding to this was he was very much reflecting on his own thoughts, and his own feelings towards the project. Alex, who was the third guy, he actually said at some point, "[inaudible 00:18:31] is so gay." Because he's so reflective, and I mean, he's from Spain, so he's like machismo. He was like, "This is so gay." But that really helped because Hans was telling us, "You know what, guys? I'm not feeling good about this, and I'm getting really nervous.
