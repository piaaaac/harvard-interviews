Title: Unsuccessful Intel (pitch) Project in Mobile/internet/Communication industry

----

Text: It was a pitch, maybe the most important pitch as a business opportunity we have had, which was Intel a great telecommunication company today. We worked so hard, so hard on it. I would tell you that we worked one and half months on it and during the last two weeks we worked Monday thru Sunday up to 2 am everyday. We filmed 20 commercials. We came with 20 filmed commercials, we got everything free, the production companies were with us and we presented it and the presentation was – the success feeling we had was incredible. The client congratulated us but we didn’t win and the most disappointing thing of all was that a client that worked there and then went to work elsewhere told us that we had been the most creative agency in doing the presentation, that we had surprised them, but that our strategic planning was very bad and that other agencies had beaten us on that. Strategic planning is very important for Intel, it’s not just about amazing creativity. It has to be about how are we going to do this later – creativity is not enough, and that was very frustrating. When they told us that we had won it, it was one of the toughest losses I have experienced in my professional life. I was bitter and it was hard for us to get out of it and get our desire to work back. From what I felt they were willing to do something new and take risks. I had Intel in another agency and they are a risk-tolerant brand. They are very innovative in every way so they weren’t looking for the same old thing, besides they had a very specific problem where they needed to take even more risks. It said a lot of things. It’s another role of briefs and campaigns. When they ask you to communicate three or four things at the same time and those three or four things are poorly communicated, at best they are poorly communicated. I think that you have to be clearer and communicate one thing at a time and do it well. People, in the little time they have, are not willing to give away 20 seconds of their day for you to confuse them on top of everything. I think you have to be clearer. The brief was – no, it wasn’t useful. It was complicated to – it had too much information. For planning and for those who like to go into the background and read, read and read, well of course. But it was not a useful brief for the creative sector. It was very hard to come to a more summarized brief in order to have it be useful for creativity. Of course, because that’s what happened. The creative part, according to the client, was spectacular but the strategic planning was not what they were looking for. In particular? No, not so much. I think it has to do with going out in the street, with how people – in this case since it was about phones – speak on the phone or on their cellphone, how they communicated and taking that to resolve our specific problems that were presented in the brief. I think that was part of observation, of walking around. It’s just that it was so much; we spent two weeks where we ate and breathed Intel. I could not tell you about something in specific that inspired us to resolve this. It’s hard. Besides all teams worked on this and that was stressing. I don’t like working like that. An entire creative department cannot be working on a pitch. Within the normal range of relationships that take place during pitches, a good relationship but distant. When you go and do the pitch, the reaction from the client – a lot of people during the presentation – they all have their poker faces on. They don’t give you a lot of feedback. They sort of stay as – what do you call it? Objective and neutral. You don’t see a – it’s not like, “We’re ready.” “We got them, look at how they are laughing.” So it was a normal relationship. Did it affect it? I think that those kinds of things always affect the result, what happens is that it affects in the sense that maybe we took six days doing what we could’ve done in two, but we were happy in the end. Maybe if we would’ve had more time we would’ve taken two days instead of five and it would’ve turned out better. I think that affected the result. Yes. It seemed they were lazy and that they didn’t take risk. They were working for themselves rather than for an agency or a team. The same thing, the same weakness that the people from planning have had all the time since I’ve been here. There didn’t bring a lot to the table. No, accounts are different. They are not incompetent, it’s just that maybe they didn’t distribute exactly – that’s an important problem, they didn’t delegate exact competencies. “Look, you are going to handle this, you this and you this.” It was done backwards, when we had a creative idea then from that moment on they started to write a communication strategy, to look for background information, to do small focus groups but directed to what we wanted to investigate. I think that was done incorrectly. Most of the times they lean on too hard on the creative department, like “let’s see what we do once we have the idea.” It has to be about how are we going to do this later – creativity is not enough, and that was very frustrating. When they told us that we had won it, it was one of the toughest losses I have experienced in my professional life. I was bitter and it was hard for us to get out of it and get our desire to work back. What we found out was that strategic planning was what had been very wrong. That they not been happy at all with that and that was the decisive factor that kept us from winning, that the proposal itself could not be entirely based on creativity alone. t said a lot of things. It’s another role of briefs and campaigns. When they ask you to communicate three or four things at the same time and those three or four things are poorly communicated, at best they are poorly communicated. I think that you have to be clearer and communicate one thing at a time and do it well. People, in the little time they have, are not willing to give away 20 seconds of their day for you to confuse them on top of everything. I think you have to be clearer. No. No. No. It was a long time working on the same thing. It was too hard. What I was telling you about, the last two weeks we worked on it till 2 a.m. from Monday to Sunday. That was too much. We had enough time to make a campaign, not too much but enough time. I think it has to do with – people inspired us. I think it has to do with people. I think that’s another factor in advertising. In advertising you have to know when they talk about insights and those things, they matter. I think that inspiration is in the street, in the people who use the phone in the case of Intel. Inspiration is in the guy who drives a car in the case of Ford. It’s enough to observe them, ask them and see their behavior and feel that. That’s the inspiration for a lot of things. y. So three commercials I did for the subways that were very successful I saw on a bus; they took place there. The same thing that I saw happening I turned into a commercial and I sold it to the subway and they thought – that was also gratifying for me, to do things that happened on the bus. I think that was part of observation, of walking around. It’s just that it was so much; we spent two weeks where we ate and breathed Intel. I could not tell you about something in specific that inspired us to resolve this. It was stressing. I think the workload took its toll on us. There were discussions, arguments, fights. There were a lot of us thinking about the same thing for a long time. Maybe if we would’ve had more time we would’ve taken two days instead of five and it would’ve turned out better. I think that affected the result. They were also arguments. There were things that accounts had to do that they didn’t do. Besides, at that time, the account team was people who, in my opinion, were incompetent. I didn’t like the way they worked. It seemed to me they were lazy.  No, accounts are different. They are not incompetent, it’s just that maybe they didn’t distribute exactly – that’s an important problem, they didn’t delegate exact competencies. “Look, you are going to handle this, you this and you this.” I
