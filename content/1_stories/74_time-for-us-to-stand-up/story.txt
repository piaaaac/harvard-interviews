Title: Time for us to stand up

----

Text: I think the right to food now has become a priority after COVID and the current circumstances, the challenges that organisations that we work with are facing and will be facing. I think it's time for us to stand up and really do something about it and I think … everybody has some kind of issue about food. And as you said, Lewis, you know if you eat you're in and we are all in so what we have to do I think is raise awareness about this and get people to care. How to communicate, how to engage more people in these conversations, how local authorities should be involved in these conversations - they should be listening to the people that are working around food,  around communities… the right word means so much, personally, and to the many communities that we work with.
