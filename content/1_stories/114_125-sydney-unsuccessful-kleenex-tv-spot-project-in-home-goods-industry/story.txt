Title: 125 SYDNEY Unsuccessful Kleenex TV spot Project in Home goods industry

----

Text: One that springs to mind is the Kleenex TV commercial I made a few years ago. And I kind of vowed never to work on the product again, because we were sort of led to believe we had our heads and we could do something creative and I'm not sure if it was such a disastrous project because we were mislead and then felt betrayed, and from then on we just went looking for proof that we were being betrayed, every day and got more and more Found more and more proof and every step became... every step became another obstacle, and the obstacles just because bigger the more that we did. But generally it was, yeah have your head, have this idea, here's a few perimeters to work to, but it turns out that we really didn't have any hope in hell in doing anything we really wanted to do. It was like a bit of a rouse to get a storyline out of it, and once the storyline was in place, all of the other mandatories could be locked in and controlled and right down to the color of the background and right down to the size of the font. It was just totally managed by the client and the internal management system, and we were pretty much just turning up and being told what to do. And I don't think, I'm pretty sure... because it's got a puppy in it, you talk to people outside of the industry and they say no that was fine, that was a great ad, isn't the puppy cute? So I don't think they really noticed how the edit didn't really make sense, how all of those things we're trying to make work, probably tells us a good ad is coming out, none of those were quite working. It was very clunky, the graphics weren't quite working, so maybe I was just tainted by the process and the ad wasn't actually as bad as I thought it was, but it wasn't a great deal of creativity involved in the storyline in the end. About five. There was about five, but I remember a lot of the decisions were left up to the two junior people who seemed to be doing everything they could to impress their management. Just making as many comments as possible to impress somebody. I'm not sure if it was such a disastrous project because we were mislead and then felt betrayed, and from then on we just went looking for proof that we were being betrayed, every day and got more and more- But generally it was, yeah have your head, have this idea, here's a few perimeters to work to, but it turns out that we really didn't have any hope in hell in doing anything we really wanted to do.

It was very dictatorial, there wasn't very cooperative. I don't know if it's just me, but I don't really function well when I'm asked to be creative and then told how to be creative. So yeah, there just wasn't a lot of collaboration. It was just lots of we know what we want, just give us what we want. It kind of pushed us together, we sort of... yeah it probably helped our relationship I think, as a team, because it was kind of us against them really. So it solidified us and I noticed we started to find other ways to find other creative outlets, probably through comedy and whatever, just having a general joke amongst ourselves to make it all not so serious and lighten it up a bit, which is a good thing. They weren't nasty, but they weren't very solid. We really just didn't have much to say or much to do with them really. Once we realized it was do as you're told, there wasn't a lot of communication, like if you want to kill a relationship, just don't communicate. That's what we were trying to do, I think subconsciously.   Yeah, we just got a sense of they didn't care, they'd moved on, they didn't have to worry about it anymore so there really was no communication.
