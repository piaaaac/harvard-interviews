Title: Providing food with dignity

----

Text: Everyone should have a right to food, regardless of background. And the difficulty is in finding the people who are too proud to come in ask (for help). And it's providing food with dignity. What I'd love to see in an ideal world, is that everyone knows where to go to get help. And the government has to accept responsibility and do it properly, and engage with people who are on the ground to know what's happening, and not just sit somewhere in an office and try and control it from there, you know, go out speak to the people that are dealing with this day in and day out and manage your programme based on that, rather than paper reading exercises or tickbox exercises.
