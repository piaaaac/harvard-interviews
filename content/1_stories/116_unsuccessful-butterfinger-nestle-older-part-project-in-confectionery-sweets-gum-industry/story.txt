Title: Unsuccessful Butterfinger/Nestle (older part) Project in Confectionery/sweets/gum industry

----

Text: The agency will do the TV and print and have the big idea, but everybody else will do their own part of it. You give 10 different creative people 10 different things to do and they're all gonna wanna make it as much theirs as possible, and it doesn't always fit with the vision of the overall arching idea. So arguably the first year of that idea, while it was a huge idea, it turned into a little bit of a Tower of Babel where you had different people speaking in different languages all trying to build this idea up, but not really communicating with each other as much, doing their own separate thing because they are being paid to go off and do their own separate thing. And it just didn't gel as much. It didn't seem as cohesive an idea as possible. On the client side it was not too many, like three or four layers, but they were all pretty cohesive and tied together. But it was all the disparate parts of it. They all had to see and judge. So there were too many players and too many things coming at them from different angles, I think made it harder for them to make it all as cohesive judgment as well, even though arguably those three or four layers were fairly closely aligned and tight.  Again, it was like the creative team and then the executive creative director, so it was pretty tight. We were very much aligned on our side, but we couldn't control the other stuff, the other partners. We could tell them what we thought they should do, but they weren't contractually obligated to do any of that. They only had to answer to the brand manager, who was Nestle, and while the brand manager was pretty good, I think those were decisions that would have better been served with one creative head on it who was qualified and expert in that area to help guide them on it as opposed to him sort of having to become a quick study on all things creative in seven or eight different capacities which nobody, I've been a creative director for a long time, I'm not an expert at everything on the internet. They were very willing to take risk on that, which was great. They knew that for this target they had to be edgy and they were willing to be edgy. They did. And a lot of it did very well, but some of it didn't, like a lot of the other partners, you can't really research a PR idea. Or some viral things and some of that kind of stuff. So while some of that was good, it didn't all seem part of the same idea sometimes. It seemed very disparate. But yeah, they did test all that, which is good, but I think it also maybe, again not being all part of one campaign that was pulled together and maybe looked at or tested might have hurt it in some ways. It was a very good brief. We wanted to make connect with our target more and be clever and connect with humor in the fun way the brand always does, and so this icon, which was sort of representing the brand, is gonna become the authority on fun the way is sort of the fun candy bar, this kind of quirky, offbeat humor kind of way, which was what the finger was always gonna point to was soft of offbeat humor that very much was in the brand character. It was a very good brief. But many people interpreted it different ways and it wasn't necessarily all coming from one sort of vision. But the finger was orange. So it was the finger. And it was this kind of hand that would point to funny things. Butterfinger has this reputation as being a sort of funny and odd candy bar, and this was this funny and odd sort of icon to represent it, not dissimilar to the way that the king sort of represents Burger King. They have the logo with the hamburger, but somebody, here's this odd king character which is also the name of the chain. So arguably the first year of that idea, while it was a huge idea, it turned into a little bit of a Tower of Babel where you had different people speaking in different languages all trying to build this idea up, but not really communicating with each other as much, doing their own separate thing because they are being paid to go off and do their own separate thing. And it just didn't gel as much. It didn't seem as cohesive an idea as possible. And I think that sort of getting back to how many layers were there, how many people were there, there were too many participants, too many layers. I think the tighter focus you have on any creativity the better. And that was one of those examples where too many cooks in the kitchen. So there were too many players and too many things coming at them from different angles, I think made it harder for them to make it all as cohesive judgment as well, even though arguably those three or four layers were fairly closely aligned and tight. PROJECT ID But he was certainly asked to be an expert on creative, and things on the internet, things in PR, not his skill set. So it was difficult for him I think as well. Even within the guidelines. Nestle's a fairly conservative company and they've got guidelines and sort of principles that they want to adhere to that aren't too out there, but they were willing to really be as edgy as they can get. We were considered to be the edgiest work they'd ever done in that division probably.
