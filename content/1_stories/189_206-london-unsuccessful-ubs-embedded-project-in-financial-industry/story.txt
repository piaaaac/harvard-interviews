Title: 206 LONDON Unsuccessful UBS (embedded) Project in Financial industry

Text: Okay. Well, a project that went really well in terms of the results and...that's really hard for me to say something went bad, cause I'm still a junior, and everything seems to be going so well, you know? I'm doing an M.A. video, I came straight from a B.A., didn't do an M.A. Basically I could be doing an M.A. now, but instead of by day, learning everything here, sharing so much knowledge with some of the best designers in the world. So for me to say that something's gone negatively, I can't really think much. If I'm being really picky, it is one of the strongest projects in the year has gone through. And I enjoyed it a lot. But it didn't really devote much of my product design side of it, that's what I'm trying to do at the moment. Everyone knows I'm very flexible, and leadership will come as I stay here longer, but you kind of forget, some people kind of forget that I'm actually a product designer. One of the big things I'm trying to do is, like I said, reinstate that sort of thing. But on a project, I recently read there was no product designer, but they knew I could aid the head graphic designer, cause I can develop graphics. And they know cause I'm a junior that I could get things done, sort out, you know, organize things. In the negative, in a way that's kind of a negative thing for me. It progressed me again, in the flexibility side of things, but didn't really progress me in the content side of it, my product design side of it. So, in a way, that's kind of negative, but...when there's a negative, there's always properly a positive.  One of the first projects is on, where I still had that sort of that immature dude, and didn't know exactly how IDEO process worked. It felt a bit down, and maybe we all designed some stuff, and maybe there's one idea that I came up with, and I think it didn't go through or connect with everyone, and I felt disappointed.

As long as it's backed up, we probably could have gone out there, but we didn't find much say that we should do something risky. There's no point, you gotta make people happy. Yeah, it was perfect. We did a work-life balance thing, so it was all about leaving...start at nine-thirty, lunch, little bit of fun during the day, and then finishing at six. It was about two days a week, really. But previously they were there three to four days a week, I think. So, yeah, they'd come over, we'd give them stuff to do, and work with us, and that's where we died off, to the point that we were just getting stuff ready to go out in the field test. But they were working along us while it was all happening. Yeah, she's great. I think it was also her first project lead, and because it was like a organizational project really, of getting these thing out to field test, there wasn't much more than, the client was already on board. There wasn't much client looking after and pampering, saying that was why they gave it to her, I think. She's a good organizer, and she got it all done, and we made a great margin. But yeah, we get on great now, cause she felt bad sort of for bringing me on the project, cause there's no product design to be done, or any design. But she knew that I could get things done, and I was the sort of person that could help her on that project. So she asked, she kind of came up and said, do you mind working on this project for a second, and I said, hey it's cool, that'll help me in my flexibility side of things. Show services I can dabble in that sort of things. So it's cool. But yeah, we're cool now. Yeah, she's great.

All of us supposedly had been there under year. Been the idea, well around a year, under a year. So, we're all quite, not naïve, but still quite junior. They're not that. Two of them and the project leader, they're not, they're all middle age, seniors. But I was the most junior. We're all still quite young in the IDEO terms. It felt a bit down, and maybe we all designed some stuff, and maybe there's one idea that I came up with, and I think it didn't go through or connect with everyone, and I felt disappointed. But Alan said, how are we gonna get inspired. It was all about field testing, the content that was already there. Since you call people I never worked with, but you get to know them, you get to work with them, and you bond relationships so quickly though. So, we're all quite, not naïve, but still quite junior. They're not that. Two of them and the project leader, they're not, they're all middle age, seniors. But I was the most junior. We're all still quite young in the IDEO terms.
