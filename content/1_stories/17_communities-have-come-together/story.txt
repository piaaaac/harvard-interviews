Title: Communities have come together

----

Text: Some communities have come together more to help each other, especially around food, perhaps shopping for neighbours, sourcing local food, or advising others where they're getting their milk delivered from and this sort of thing. So, I don't think it's all bad in fact, people couldn't really travel around. So, we were forced to just be in that five mile radius and kind of identify with that sort of idea and what's there or who was there? I think from my point of view, it's actually quite good because I was able to grow things in my own garden and perhaps, seeds from some other people to sort of share around. And as far as sort of growing personally, I've improved.
