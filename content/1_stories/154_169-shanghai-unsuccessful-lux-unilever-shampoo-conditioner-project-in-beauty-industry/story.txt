Text: There's quite a few runs of the work, and the presentations, but no one actually buy for the idea. He means in China, the bigger clients has more conservative attitudes [inaudible 00:16:38]. Unclear brief. Too many people judge on the work and from different offices, different places all over the world. And the brief is keep changing. Very low and conservative. If the strategy and direction would be more clearer, that would be helpful, but just one slogan, and after their presentation, the presentation had been rejected. They're not very inspired.

They don't communicate much, so the less of communication makes some kind of mismatch.
