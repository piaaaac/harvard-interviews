Title: Unsuccessful Premier Automobiles (Audi distributor) Project in Transportation industry

----

Text: Okay I worked for this car client, that I worked on when I was in Singapore. It's an international client with a lot of restrictions. As in the ads, you can only do it with the visuals that the client has in the database. All the visuals are only of car pictures that are shot from different angles. We were working with them and whenever we did a visual it was don't bother with a new idea. Just go to our database for the visual. And then there's an A3, there's A4, there's an A6 and there's an A8. We should go ask for these [inaudible 00:24:12]. So A3 is catered to a certain audience, A4 a certain audience, so on and so forth. So the lines were written basically on that audience, or for that audience. And they would just put in the visual, and that's your ad. I actually worked really hard on their ads. So that at least their standard because that's the only thing that is different or that can be worked around a little bit with it, just a car visual at the end of it. Irrespective of whether it's a good wager or not, it's just a car. So you can show the car in so many landscape, and then what? So the visual for us, it got to be a bit boring because we used to see good visuals of cars all the time. So the line, going to mean that we work very hard for that to work well. So we used to work hard on the lines, but then eventually I wasn't very satisfied because the idea is just in the line. And then it goes onto the body copy. But the visual is just like a support [inaudible 00:25:17]. And it'd be better if the visual and the line worked together very well. And you know it was an idea that started the whole thing off. Not, I had the visual and I just had to write a line to make it work. So it was not really nice.  Well there were but for these ads it was small. We just had to follow the same [inaudible 00:29:04]. There was a great [inaudible 00:29:06] bottom of it. But then a lot of things come in from, I don't know where Audi is internationally, and then we just had to follow them. The visuals we just can't advertise, because they couldn't afford to shoot everything, it's too expensive. So I guess they use the same visuals from the database. Money also, that's very tight. I always try to get a small [inaudible 00:30:52] regain the copy and photo visual that there is. I try to [inaudible 00:30:54] the car by use of background or I still use the scenario of the whole picture. So I should make sure that the line was as close to the visual as possible. But that is work to get me to select certain lines, say, "I think this is good" and then send it for approval. They know it's just the line, and the visual has to be a nice visual. I'm sure there are some bad visuals hidden within the database. But there is not much you can do about the visual. There's stuff from [inaudible 00:32:03] and ... But the line, [Soshi 00:55:57] knew that the visual's there, and we know the line has to work with the visual. She was the [inaudible 00:32:14]. We were working with them and whenever we did a visual it was don't bother with a new idea. So the visual for us, it got to be a bit boring because we used to see good visuals of cars all the time. So the line, going to mean that we work very hard for that to work well. So we used to work hard on the lines, but then eventually I wasn't very satisfied because the idea is just in the line.
