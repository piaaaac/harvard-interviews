    "text": "He's from Hell's Kitchen, anyway. He come out in the press saying he thinks Knorr Stock Cubes is the best ingredient in the kitchen so it was all about this quote from him saying best effing ingredient in the world, he said, so we wanted to use that as the strapline and at the first the client was all up for it and stuff, and we met Marco and everything, and basically the client kept changing their mind. They were so indecisive that in the end with actually got to the executional stage and said we're not happy. We've done about 10 ideas for them, and they just kept steering us the wrong direction. The two clients would go away and they'd just confuse each other. In the end when they finally got to the stage of where we showed them the ad, they were like, not sure about this, now. It was like no matter what we could have done for them they wouldn't have made a decision. In the end, there was a total rebrief and then they put two teams on to it so the client was so upset, but, that's, you know what I mean. Luckily it was solved, they've got a new ad. I didn't, it was just because I was working on it, the got two other teams to work on it so, that was very frustrating because we did so much work That's a huge amount. We honestly spent so much time, we've got nothing to show for it now. Because [inaudible 00:28:15] anything. That was a print campaign which isn't particularly big but it was like doing a huge project because you just spent so much time, because on everything they just kept changing their minds about ... because he was so open to stuff, she would be able to persuade him not and she was more junior than him. So it was like, she's making the calls and he is more senior and he was open and she was like, `Oh.` It was a bit of a nightmare. I think the personalities to be honest. Because we met the client quite a number of times and they would say something, then the two of them would go back and have a conversation between ... They're almost like a husband and wife, this client. Because he was quite open to stuff and she was really conservative, so the two of them, because he was so open to stuff, she would be able to persuade him not and she was more junior than him. So it was like, she's making the calls and he is more senior and he was open and she was like, `Oh.` It was a bit of a nightmare. That's interesting because when they do pitches for new accounts, they reckon the chemistry when they come to pitch is really interesting because do you want to work for these people, do they get on even the agency, because if they don't, why would you even want to work with them. You want to be working with a team who are solid and they like each other. No, when you do a pitch you'll have a creative director but the actual managing director and the account people and the planner, do those people who are representing that agency in that pitch, do those people get on? Because they're representing the agency in terms of do I want these people working for me? They do, yes, because at the end of the day, you can be creative but you do want the project or whatever it is to run smoothly. It was just a matter of tell people that Marco Pierre White, again it was actually more complex than that. It wasn't just tell people that Marco Pierre White said this was the best effing ingredient in the world, it was how he uses it as well. So we had to do a recipe of how he uses it, [inaudible 00:31:40], it gets more and more complex. And then they would, they weren't sure about how important that was, so, `Is that important or is it the fact that Marco [inaudible 00:31:48] more important?` It was just all over the shop. It's about mental inspiration. Like I said, when I used to work at last agency they did that Guinness surfing one, the Guinness Surfer ad. Walter, one of the guys who wrote that, he worked there, and he was really motivating. You'd go and have a chat with him and you'd come out really motivated. To be honest with you that's part of the job of creative director as well. Obviously it's their interest to motivate the team to come back and give you their best ideas. It's really important. It's massively important. If I was a creative director, I wouldn't want a diverse department. Yes. The actual diversity between two people in a team. It's tricky because it doesn't happen a lot but you do get teams that break up. The thing is, to be honest with you, you don't really want that to happen. Because the thing is, if you're the creative director and one of your team split up it leaves you in a bit of an awkward position. So I think diversity between two people in the team, it isn't massively important but you don't like to think that the two people sitting there coming up with the same ideas all day, you'd like to think that, and that's usually the case, they don't come up with the same ideas, even if they do seem similar. You do want, if you have a department of creatives you want the teams to be different, definitely, because you have all different types of projects on and you think someone's more suited to that than others. No, they didn't research, and to be honest with you, looking back, I almost wish they did because at least they would have had something to go by. So, well, the research said that was good, we should do that, whereas they didn't knowing themselves what was good, so. It was a bit of a nightmare. See, research is a bit of a hot potato as well, to be honest. People say if research is so good then how come there's so much bad advertising out there? Research used in the right way can be okay, but there's loads of instances where a great idea ... I don't know if you've seen it, there's an Arnold Worldwide did this little example, they did the 1984 Apple ad, have you seen that? They did that as an animatic, which is how most work gets viewed in research groups. And they showed that recently and they filmed the group's response to it, because normal people don't really know that ad. And the response is fantastic at how much they slagged it off. Yet it was this pioneering ad. I don't know, have you seen that, have you? Yes, we went over, there's a thing in the campaign I spoke about, creative presented to clients and whether it's a good idea or not. Again it depends, it depends on the creatives as well, because some creatives don't like it. We like doing it because we don't like to waste time on projects, we like to see what people want and working within the area where we can be most creative, otherwise you waste time. Because time is so important in terms of coming up with a great idea. If you come up with a great ideas and they don't go nowhere you get frustrated. If you said they're the premises, just try to be as creative as you can in those premises, and then you usually can come up with, because then you've used that time productively to do the best piece of creative in those parameters, so we like to do that. And it's just the actual explaining of your idea, there's very few people, I think, who I would trust to do a better job. The odd [inaudible 00:37:02] very odd [inaudible 00:37:03] man to be honest. Personally I prefer, but most creatives, oh well, [inaudible 00:37:07] most but a lot, don't want to present Yes, we went over, there's a thing in the campaign I spoke about, creative presented to clients and whether it's a good idea or not. Again it depends, it depends on the creatives as well, because some creatives don't like it. We like doing it because we don't like to waste time on projects, we like to see what people want and working within the area where we can be most creative, otherwise you waste time.

Personally I prefer, but most creatives, oh well, [inaudible 00:37:07] most but a lot, don't want to present. It seemed fine. Because like we didn't like we weren't like rude or anything to each other, it's just that they were so indecisive, so it's not much we can do if we've got a client who keeps changing his mind, we can persuade him all we like and he'll say yes, and go away, make a phone call after he's thought about it a bit and say actually no to the account person who will then feed back to us, so. Sometimes he would say where he was uncomfortable with, but if we said, `Okay, in that case why don't we try this?` He'll go, `Oh, all right.` Then go away, think about it, and then ... I wasn't like sitting there I hate your guts. And it was like, it's quite interesting, because when you work on a project like that and you spend so much time on it, whatever your end product is to show for all that pain, you want to make it as good as possible, because of all those hours you spent on it, when he does try to tweet things, you probably automatically become more reluctant because the whole time you're trying to save it because you've spent so much time on it. You're just trying to salvage what you can. So when they say, `Can we change it?` You're a bit like not really, because you're going to make it worse. Luckily we already knew the accountant quite well with actually helped, we get on quite well with him, so. We didn't make light of it because it wasn't funny but luckily the team that we worked with we got on quite well with so that helped. So it was just business, really. We had a creative director who had a little bit of influence but not lots. He wasn't around very much he was on holidays and stuff so it was a little bit left up to us to be honest. The only thing I will say is, we'd a had a great account person to handle the client better that might have helped. we met Marco and everything, and basically the client kept changing their mind. They were so indecisive that in the end with actually got to the executional stage and said we're not happy. It was like no matter what we could have done for them they wouldn't have made a decision.

I didn't, it was just because I was working on it, the got two other teams to work on it so, that was very frustrating because we did so much work. PROJECT ID because on everything they just kept changing their minds about ... They're open to it. They're open to it. In terms of they encouraged us to be as creative as we could. But then when you do that they're, `Ooh, no, I can't.` And then they just kept changing their minds, so ... But then when you do that they're, `Ooh, no, I can't.` And then they just kept changing their minds, so ... PROJECT ID she would be able to persuade him not and she was more junior than him. So it was like, she's making the calls and he is more senior and he was open and she was like, `Oh.` It was a bit of a nightmare.  So we had to do a recipe of how he uses it, [inaudible 00:31:40], it gets more and more complex. And then they would, they weren't sure about how important that was, so, `Is that important or is it the fact that Marco [inaudible 00:31:48] more important?` It was just all over the shop.

That was here, yes.   To be honest with you that's part of the job of creative director as well. Obviously it's their interest to motivate the team to come back and give you their best ideas. It's really important. It's massively important.

    "text": "In the office. I remember we were talking [inaudible 00:21:23] the creative director and it sort of [inaudible 00:21:26] creative director got involved and made it better as well to be honest at the time. No, we wrote, we, between, we wrote them up and the creative director, his input, he would help shape them as well. So he had a lot to do with it as well. And [inaudible 00:21:45] script was presented to client, it was all quite quick turnaround of ours, because it, we had such a looming deadline, it was a lot of pressure on that project. It was all quite ... No, we previously had been to the client with other ideas. Two, maybe, at the most. But this was like, even when I look back on it now, it was like a bolt out of nowhere, really. And it explains sort of, that situation isn't an ideal one to be in in terms of deadlines looming and then you've got to come up with something. But, it can, one of the things, the thing about creativity, it's how long is a piece of string, it can come to you when you haven't got deadlines, [inaudible 00:22:36] account. Easier when it comes to when you haven't got a deadline, though. When you have it's a bit of a struggle. On that project? We had a good relationship with them, actually. He was, to be honest with you, the whole thing came down to the fact that he was a good client, really. The relationship was good but it was a good relationship and we were quite closely within, I can even remember his name was [John Hawkes 00:23:16], I don't remember that many clients' names. Because he brought so much good work. Because he could see a good idea, really. He didn't, it wasn't a case where he brought a really good idea, there were good ideas he didn't buy as well. But ... Fine, yes. We don't really analyze the basis of our relationship that much, me and Mark. The relationship only comes into, you only feel like, if there's a time pressure, [inaudible 00:24:07] sort of, [inaudible 00:24:09] might be [inaudible 00:24:11] friction if you know what I mean. It can be. It's not ideal, it's just if you're on a deadline's looming or you're working on something you don't want to work on you can often get agitated by that as well, when you know a client's never going to buy a good idea. It's like, it's almost like, it's like not enjoying your work because you have the same symptoms of somebody who's in a job where they don't want to be there. That's what it's like working on a project where you don't [inaudible 00:24:40] work on it, do you know what I mean. There's nothing particularly special about it, put it that way. It was just, everyday thing, really. Just came up with a good idea and it got made and it got bought, it doesn't happen that often. [inaudible 00:25:13] it does is. If we could explain it we'd be doing it a lot more, presumably. Yes, the client is quite influential, the client. It depends what your definition of `what went well.` I can tell you for me success, well, quite selfishly is when you win an award. But from the client, it's obviously making the product sell a lot great for their brand. But the thing is they've done these studies where 73, I think it's the Gunn Report, but they did 73% of award-winning advertising is also effective advertising. So the way we try to sell to clients is, the best work for your business is award-winning work because it's proven that it works, it sells. When we did it we didn't think it wasn't going to win loads of awards, we just, because it's such a hard brief, all we could think about is cracking this brief because everybody had a go at it, the deadline was looming, we were into real sort of pressure, so we made that with a good director, shot it and then [inaudible 00:16:47] it and stuff and people seemed to love it. And then it did really well, so. And then it was reshot in Canada, they reshot it for their market. Then the client re-ran it quite a lot of times because they loved it. So that was a successful one for us. Yes the brief was something vaguely to do with summer because it was a price promotion [inaudible 00:19:01] Quarter Pounder and it was vaguely to do with summer. And then we just, we had this idea and the client was good enough to realize that this idea was bigger than the brief. It was quite ... It was something to do with the summer and I can't remember [inaudible 00:19:16] about `Enjoy summer with a McDonald 99p Quarter Pounder` or a special offer. But it was one of the things, a Quarter Pounder with cheese is a quarter pounder with cheese, there's not much else you can say with it, so, we come up with this really simple and entertaining way of selling it. Then luckily the client was clever enough to realize it was a great idea. Easier when it comes to when you haven't got a deadline, though. When you have it's a bit of a struggle. t's just if you're on a deadline's looming or you're working on something you don't want to work on you can often get agitated by that as well, It's like, it's almost like, it's like not enjoying your work because you have the same symptoms of somebody who's in a job where they don't want to be there. It's like, it's almost like, it's like not enjoying your work because you have the same symptoms of somebody who's in a job where they don't want to be there. That's what it's like working on a project where you don't [inaudible 00:24:40] work on it, do you know what I mean. And ours was just, this is the amount of work a plumber has to do to be able to afford the McDonald's 99p burger, I think because in the summer it's particularly hot, you don't tend to go for a big burger  And then we stumbled across this idea which is basically, it was a price idea, because they usually do price, talk about price and then attach it to a theme or whatever. one thing about McDonald's then is they didn't use research.   And then we just, we had this idea and the client was good enough to realize that this idea was bigger than the brief. It was quite ... It was something to do with the summer and I can't remember [inaudible 00:19:16] about `Enjoy summer with a McDonald 99p Quarter Pounder` or a special offer.

    "text": "At the start it seemed okay. It seemed like lots of freedom. But then I think when it got to the crunch, when the guy had to start explaining it to his bosses that freedom was taken away quite drastically. Once they start trying to justify and over analyze the metaphor it was just quite clear that they were never really going to let us do the kind of ad we wanted to do. Although, that was quite late in the stage. That was quite late in the day. We just had to ... I'd just rather not make something like that and just do another idea, whether it be us or someone else in the department. It's always better just to ... if you can't do it how you want to do it, it's always better to just try and think of something else rather than to flog a dead horse. I don't know if you remember it. It was this black poet guy and it was sort of mastication for the nation was the idea. It was this guy who was just sort of spreading the word, really. I mean, it was, I don't know who said it was racist. It never really was. That was never the intent. I think both were, budget and time, we're fine. They had quite a reasonable budget because it was a launch. The times were fine as well. I think we had quite a lot of time for development and research. In both cases, that was fine I think. I remember there was an American client called Phil ... Phil somebody. He, after we wrote out the scripts he had a few points, which we went away and addressed some of them, but then some of them just simply weren't addressable because it's just a metaphor really at the end of the day and you can't justify everything. It was fine. It was fine, at first. We had a good relationship with the client. We went to present all our own stuff along with the account team. The account teams pretty good as well. It's always good to present your own stuff. Although, its kind of nice to have them as support as well in the room. The client seems to really like it. They are creative to the whole idea. The metaphors for the taste, it was all about the taste really. That's what made it different to any other competitor. It started off all right. But once it got researched and they tried to justify ... we sort of started to have arguments with the client. Not directly I think, by then. I think we probably answered a few of their questions. I remember there was an American client called Phil ... Phil somebody. He, after we wrote out the scripts he had a few points, which we went away and addressed some of them, but then some of them just simply weren't addressable because it's just a metaphor really at the end of the day and you can't justify everything. Well, yeah. No, they're all ... it was just a round table like this and then a conference call. So we're always working as a team.[crosstalk 00:45:20] Yeah. We met with them. I got ... they've got offices somewhere up ... I don't know where it is actually. It's not far ... it's like a train journey away. We went over there and they'd come here and we went there. Then just towards the end of it when we simply couldn't justify any more, we just said look, it's just a metaphor about taste and that's all it's ever going to be. I think we just said look, we shot down ... I think we should do this idea. I don't know actually. I think I remember talking to James about saying I don't think we should do this idea because if they're going to over analyze and justify it, it's the type of idea that you can't really do that with. Probably put it in such a way that it was a mutual decision between client and agency ... it's in everyone's best interest to do another idea that's going to be good for launching a new product. I think it's just best to do another idea and I suppose once you can't answer their questions after research, once you can't ... once he needs questions answered so he can go to his boss and turn the answers but if he can no longer do that I suppose it's a call for you to see if you should have another idea. Don't know if we actually made the decision but I suppose we must have said to Greg and Mike, our creative directors at the time that we should be doing this and we should be doing that right there. At that time they probably would have shared that with the account team and then someone would have to tell the client really. Probably put it in such a way that it was a mutual decision between client and agency ... it's in everyone's best interest to do another idea that's going to be good for launching a new product. It was good really. I mean, they were of the same opinion that the client is over justifying ... over analyzing it and trying to justify it. It was never ... we never really had arguments with them. Though we're always quite a close team, really. That seemed to be fine. Still is. Really supportive. We've quite a good team on that one. Really supportive. We've quite a good team on that one. It's just when the account teams come to you with these questions that you have to answer, although it's ... they're just the messengers really. You start to get a bit annoyed with them, for the account people. Sometimes you just need an account person to deal with them things with the clients. You just don't know what to tell them ... tell them why we should do it like that rather than just saying yes to everything and feeding that back to us.

You just don't know what to tell them ... tell them why we should do it like that rather than just saying yes to everything and feeding that back to us. Listerine. We had this idea for Listerine. It's a dentist's worse nightmare and it was like a T.V. ad they were going to do. We had this dentist who was having this nightmare about this huge bottle of Listerine and it was kind of like ... there's a scene in Spellbound where ... I think it's Clark Gable, is he dreaming? He's dreaming and there's this dream sequence and it's done by Salvador Dali and sort of sneaked  influences from that and we made it cinematic. We had this sort of little dentist running away from this huge bottle of Listerine. We made a really nice cinematic down here in K-posts. Got all the drawings done and the video over the top of it and ... I don't know what happened. I think we just didn't research ... it didn't go down very well for whatever reason. It's quite old. Quite a while ago and I don't remember why. Is that important to know why? I remember taking that to the client at Cadbury and they seemed to like the idea. They bought the idea. That ... after research I don't know if it went to our own research but they started over analyzing the idea and all it ever was, was a metaphor and when you start having to justify a man in a huge red leotard, or whatever, it all sort of falls apart really. I remember that one dying a death over over-analyzation. At the start it seemed okay. It seemed like lots of freedom. But then I think when it got to the crunch, when the guy had to start explaining it to his bosses that freedom was taken away quite drastically. Once they start trying to justify and over analyze the metaphor it was just quite clear that they were never really going to let us do the kind of ad we wanted to do. if you can't do it how you want to do it, it's always better to just try and think of something else rather than to flog a dead horse.

I mean, it was, I don't know who said it was racist. It never really was. That was never the intent But, it was misconstrued like that I think. That was a bit of a flop as well. It sort of ended up a bad launch for a new product in this country, really. 've probably got it somewhere. I can't actually remember the proposition. It was all about the taste. Because it's got great ... it's got a really long lasting taste compared to normal chewing gum and some quite crazy flavors as well really. Like vanilla mint and strawberry lime, you know? Total new territory for the gum world, because they'd always just been mint and spearmint and maybe Juicy Fruit. hat's what made it different to any other competitor. It started off all right. But once it got researched and they tried to justify ... we sort of started to have arguments with the client.  Phil somebody. He, after we wrote out the scripts he had a few points, which we went away and addressed some of them, but then some of them just simply weren't addressable because it's just a metaphor really at the end of the day and you can't justify everything. Well, yeah. No, they're all ... it was just a round table like this and then a conference call. So we're always working as a team We went over there and they'd come here and we went there. Then just towards the end of it when we simply couldn't justify any more, we just said look, it's just a metaphor about taste and that's all it's ever going to be. I think we just said look, we shot down ... I think we should do this idea. Again, I think it started off really well but then when it gets down to arguing about stupid things, individual details about a script, it does start to get a bit annoying and ... in that case I suppose it's the client asking for these things although, you start to get in the way of your own team because they're delivering the message to you. They're the messengers. It's not really the idea that they bought, originally. I think we probably tried to argue our way out of it by saying something like that. You bought an idea and you're trying to turn it into something that it never will be. From that point we were off the project and they would have put someone else on it. So very rare to actually have a go on it again because you've had maybe a bad experience with the whole thing. Sort of ... might charge your judgment.   You start to get a bit annoyed with them, for the account people. Sometimes you just need an account person to deal with them things with the clients. You just don't know what to tell them ... tell them why we should do it like that rather than just saying yes to everything and feeding that back to us.",

We beat them and he liked this and he said, all right, this is what we should do. We sold it to the client and they bought it. We didn't have that much money, we had to ... we worked with the administrator from the States and the way he works, he needed photographs of people in these poses so then he could apply it. He could put that into Photoshop and then paint over the top of it in order to get the desired result. We changed [inaudible 00:23:43] and this young photographer went to Ilford which has got quite a large Asian community. She went down there and took photos of Asian people in these poses for him and then we sent them away to him to paint over so it was ... we did pretty much a lot of the work that I suppose you wouldn't normally do. It could add more money so in that respect it was more enjoyable and fun to do. We really took control over it. Yeah. We paid them 50 quid or so. It was fun but in the same vein it was quite hard work to do but once we done it and you see the poster up on the street it's always rewarding. So I guess that was a good one. We had a huge kind of freedom. We really could climb and Paul Clerkly was the account manager on it, who's really good as well. Sort of understands a good idea. He liked the idea and the client was ... I really think he was a bit of a boozer but he was just really good and he just liked the idea and said do it. He gave us complete freedom and every time we got to a stage where we had to show the client something, he always liked it and he never really made us change anything. It's always so important tog et a client that is on board with you because a lot of the time, especially here as well, some of the really big clients ... I suppose being a little brand as well may be more freedom but some of the big clients like Kellogg for example, they'll always make you change it for whatever reason. It's always a battle between us and the client to get your creative idea out. Maybe being small probably helped that. Time ... timing seemed to be okay I remember. Because we had time to go out and photograph and send those shots over to the States, so it was a bit of time on it and budget was a bit of a factor. We never actually got to meet the client. It's always good to meet the client, really, and present your own work if at all possible. I think because they are actually based in India it was kind of difficult. I think we had to conference calls with them. Never actually met the guy but Paul had a pretty good relationship with him and that's always a good thing. Our relationship with the client I suppose was a bit distant but in that case it seemed like they liked the work anyway, so it was probably okay to get on with it really, I guess. It was pretty good. I suppose it was James and Ian. Paul Clerkly. I think because Nick had an awful lot on he gave it to Richard and me and we were seeing the creative team here to creative direct and once the client ... once the idea had been bought it's just sort of, get on with it, really. You have maybe deadlines or timings being what they were, which I seem to remember they're okay, it's just how are you going to do it, what are you going to do, and when are you going to do it, really. Just get on with it, really. Well, as for them. Yeah, no, it was fine. I mean, Paul is a very good guy. We get on with him. He's a new business man now so he's always good to know, pitches and stuff. He's a good guy. He's a good account man. There wasn't any problems, really. And the fact that the client liked the idea and just wanted us to get on with it and weren't research ... it was pretty smooth running. Just went ahead and did it really. It was all pretty good. Yeah, I suppose when we actually had shots and had the illustrator and the art work that's when you get down to details and you always look to creative director to direct you on that and you'd take him a few different variations and look for his guidance. I seem to remember we wanted to go a bit mad and weird the way it ended up and Rich and Ian sort of pulled us back a bit. Rightly or wrongly. I don't know about that. Yeah, we were all guided by them and by Nick as well, at the time. India's number one love but despite this advertising the advertising was just the kind of advertising you'd expect to see in India. It was just some kind of cheesy pictures of Indian people. A little bit wacky and a bit crazy. He could put that into Photoshop and then paint over the top of it in order to get the desired result. We beat them and he liked this and he said, all right, this is what we should do. t could add more money so in that respect it was more enjoyable and fun to do. We really took control over it. It's kind of funny. You go down to these places and you ask to take their picture and they're immediately suspicious and they want to know why. A lot of them just say no, they take [inaudible 00:24:35] and a lot of them are very religious and they find that's for a beer advertising and they say no. It was quite hard work to get six people to get to take their picture. But here it's only really associated with Curry Houses and even so, the Cobra beer is probably I'd say the one that all my friends would pick over Kingfisher just because it's more popular than ... I don't know why it's more popular. It's supposedly less gassy, but I don't-. It's just the one that everyone drinks. Sort of understands a good idea. He liked the idea and the client was ... I really think he was a bit of a boozer but he was just really good and he just liked the idea and said do it. He gave us complete freedom and every time we got to a stage where we had to show the client something, he always liked it and he never really made us change anything.

It's always a battle between us and the client to get your creative idea out. Maybe being small probably helped that. It's just all, it's material that we've got and it all just looked so stupid. I don't even know why they do things over there. I think that's where he got the idea from. He said it and that was the point ... you never just present one idea. One of sort of three or four that we presented but that was the one Nick liked and eventually made it. No, I think... no we were at work. In fact, I think James had the initial idea of, despite this advertising so really I just started laughing at the Indians really and the way they advertised. I think we just had a lot of material of these people in Kingfisher branded clothes and a lot of the range of Kingfisher stuff that they did over there in India. They're all really quite cheesy and their poses and they have like a Kingfisher calendar and I think they do some motoration as well.   And the fact that the client liked the idea and just wanted us to get on with it and weren't research ... it was pretty smooth running. Just went ahead and did it really. It was all pretty good.",

    "text": "The most disappointing time for a creative is when they have gone through all of the hoops and the work still dies. So there's no point in me telling you `Oh, I showed some work to a creative director and he hated it. Woe is me.` That's just pathetic. Welcome to the club. Get over it. Get over it. You're in the rejection business, because most creatives will tell you that 90% to 95% of what they do goes in the bin. You have to be tolerant to rejection. That is it. It's like being an actor going up for an audition each time. It's just you, you pitch it, and they go `Not so much. Goodbye.` And that's the end of it. All of that work's in the bin. Some of it you love, some of it you thought `Eh, a bit padded, but fuck it. I'll try it.` It's all in the bin. So then a tiny little bit that gets through. By the way, always isn't the best in your head. It's not a meritocracy. It's a subjective business, and you've got a creative director who's subjective who's got their background and their likes and dislikes, then you've got clients and then you've got the bloody consumers, and it goes up the line. Then usually what happens is this, this is where I'm gonna come in, there's one guy or one woman, it's usually a man ... I can be generalized on this, because it's true. It's usually a bloke who's a senior bod, FYI, `Could you have a look at this?` And they go `What the fuck is this? I didn't approve this brief. I'm a new [broom 00:51:09], usually. I don't like this strategy. Not sure [crosstalk 00:51:13].` A new broom as in a new manager who's come in, who just wants to make a noise and just reject work for the sake of it and goes `Right.` Well, that's being a bit unfair, but let's just say that this strategy for them is not something they agree with, `Not right tone of voice.` In the bin. And you've gone through all the hoops. Two examples. Okay, I'll give you an example of that scenario and then I'll give you another example. The first scenario is one that we did for an idea that we really liked. It still haunts me, and it just really, it's so tragic. It's like, it's just a bloody idea, but it gnaws at your guts, because you think about it all the time and you think about how good it could have been. It was for First Direct. It's a bank idea. And it was basically based on a ... It's nontraditional media. We didn't want to do TV, didn't want to do print or any of that. And it was to coincide with First Direct's birthday, although it really wasn't dependent on that. It just happened to be a nice coincidence. That was an inspiration. I've been with the bank for awhile and I thought `This is great.` The idea was just `Can you pitch just a very simple brief, friendly banking. That's the proposition. Discuss. We'll see you in awhile.` So it was like `Great, okay. Friendly banking. Very simple.` And the idea was basically they've got a huge call center up in Leads, with about 200 odd people sitting in rows and rows and rows of desks with their little microphones. Phones ring, they go `Hello, how can I help you? First Direct, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.` And to all intents and purposes, they look like machines, but they're not. They're all individual human beings and they're all up in Leads, yada yada. Went and thought `Well, this is great. Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna do a nine part, 10 part, whatever, series. Each section lasts five minutes, so let's call it half an hour altogether. A serial, which you can download on the web and it is based on a dog day afternoon situation. Five youngsters, teenagers, dopes, walk into First Direct and hold it up, thinking it's a real bank, not realizing of course that they don't have a vault, they don't have any money on site, and they're gonna try and hold this bank up.` Obviously it's a stand off, the police turn up, they're trapped, they're screwed, they're dumb. But they're still gutsy. And what you chart then is their conversations with these wonderful people who just talk to them, who do what they do best. And eventually they just talk them down and they get out of there and the guns go down, not a shot's fired, and the situation is diffused. It was a great way of saying `Friendly. These guys are brilliant at their jobs.` We pitched it to a guy ... I won't use names ... at First Direct. Scared shitless by it, but then kind of knew in his heart of hearts that it was good. Bought it, then totally unbought it. And it was based totally on the part in the bank, HSBC. He was worried about his top brass saying `Are you kidding me? You're about to sign off something about a bank holdup in our bank?` Nevermind that it was perfect for the communication and that it would be absolutely breakthrough for banking, that it would be a completely different way of advertising their products. And you could easily have weaved in extra bits inside the dialogue. So it was a vehicle that was very robust as well as being very `creative.` And I was talking about we were gonna have discussions with directors, we were talking about how we were gonna close off a certain section of the bank, we use real people, we use some of the extras could be the actual employees themselves. And they just shat themselves and they didn't do it. They pulled the plug on it. Then they changed the brief. They went from friendly to straightforward banking. That has been executed now as black and white banking, and that's been done by another team. ood relationships within the team. Very good [inaudible 01:00:13]. Good planner. Solid. Very optimistic, enthusiastic team. It gave me the freedom to think ... They didn't directly give me the freedom but I felt slightly more empowered because they themselves were quite gutsy and said what they thought. I think that has some effect on a creative. Yeah, they trust their account people and they think they're kind of cool people and it empowers them to be cool too. Good relationships within the team. Very good [inaudible 01:00:13]. Good planner. Solid. Very optimistic, enthusiastic team. It gave me the freedom to think ... They didn't directly give me the freedom but I felt slightly more empowered because they themselves were quite gutsy and said what they thought. I think that has some effect on a creative. Yeah, they trust their account people and they think they're kind of cool people and it empowers them to be cool too. You mean me and Ben? Yeah, Ben and I were just quite senior and we just< I think felt very like we were just gonna come in and say `This is it. Take it or leave it. We think this is really good and this is really right.` We were absolutely mind of one. It didn't affect the dynamic between us in any way. We just got more and more pissed off about it and then when the brief changed, I completely lost my temper. I remember getting really, really cross, and I could just see, he was backpedaling. Then when the brief changes, then you've thrown out the work. Scared shitless by it, but then kind of knew in his heart of hearts that it was good. Bought it, then totally unbought it. And it was based totally on the part in the bank, HSBC. He was worried about his top brass saying `Are you kidding me? You're about to sign off something about a bank holdup in our bank?` Nevermind that it was perfect for the communication and that it would be absolutely breakthrough for banking, that it would be a completely different way of advertising their products. Yes. And for me, they threw away an absolutely essential piece of their DNA. The reason they did that was for business concerns, because they were reacting to a general feeling of the time that banking, and still is, bankers are not being transparent in their actions, that there's lots of hidden charges, and that consumers are walking away from them as a result, and they were having a bad time of it because of that kind of reputation, generally, and they were being tarred by that. Time was a constraint. Budget was a constraint. Yeah, let's not make ... yeah, they didn't want to spend a lot of money. So we had to be ... That was part of why we came up with that idea, 'cause ... I came up with it on the train, by the way. I came up with it on the train, by the way. That often happens with advertising is you just think `What's the absolutely diametric opposite of what you'd expect?` And there the idea might live. You go `Okay, great.` So that was that. They started out open, honest. They ended up being really closed and unhelpful I'd say. And that was charted against the graph of fear factor. Just it just became `Oh, let's talk. Let's have an open discussion from that.` It just became `No.` Closed down. No emails. That's it. Good relationships within the team. Very good [inaudible 01:00:13]. Good planner. Solid. Very optimistic, enthusiastic team. It gave me the freedom to think We just got more and more pissed off about it and then when the brief changed, I completely lost my temper. I remember getting really, really cross, and I could just see, he was backpedaling. Then when the brief changes, then you've thrown out the work. You've used the work to judge the saliency of the brief, which is unforgivable. Most creatives will tell you that. That happens a lot.   `Here's a brief. Do the work to it. Oh, we don't like the brief. Never mind the work. Never mind that the work answers the brief. It's the right answer to the wrong question. Sorry about that. My bad. Well, thanks for wasting my fucking time. And by the way, squandering good work.` So it's this disposability of ideas that creatives will constantly say `Fucking hate.` Excuse my language, but it is so emotional as well as rational. It really is, 'cause we think hard. It's not just `Let's be wacky.` It has to be anchored to pure logic. Then you can be creative as long as you have that hub and you can then go, you can do anything you want off it. Zero.",

    "text": "And the structure of the commercial just instantly suggested itself, the voice over was really fun to write, fit in 30 seconds, no problem. Had some problems with the client with claims about the medicine and they always try to over complicate messages and that's a big problem. You creatives are very single minded usually, they think very simply, 'cause that's how I do this work best in 30 seconds if I'm talking about TV, similar with press. It's gotta be simple and read very quickly. And clients always want to put more information in it than the vehicle can handle. Then you're suddenly juggling too much information, and that's death to a good idea always. So that was really very satisfying. Then I got a director in who understood it, shot it really well. So it was like, sometimes it does happen. And the same thing with HSBC. I literally had two hours, had the script in my head, bang. Got a great director, shot it, client loved it. But the [Calpol 00:25:20] thing, I think probably the reason I'm most proud of that and happiest about it is because I felt like it came from me. Sometimes when the ideas are really close to you, and they feel like your baby, you get more defensive about them if they start getting compromised. And this one didn't get compromised, so it was just fantastic. It was a real gilette, punch the air moment. Oh, high risk intolerance. Oh yeah, they were not risk tolerant. But they got there in the end. And we still had trouble, even when we made the ad, because once you ... We were very clear about what we we were going to do, but it wasn't until they actually saw it that they, again, this is this lack of visualization ability, until they saw it in front of them, they couldn't quite grasp it. The budget was not really a constraint ever because there was no post production involved, minimal post production, and they were all inside existing houses. We weren't creating any special sets. We were just going into peoples' homes. So it was quite an easy shoot. So that wasn't ... Well, no, time constraints pretty relaxed. Not too bad. Yeah. Yeah. Her background wasn't that, in terms of advertising, wasn't that different to me, but she, as a person, was much more relaxed, I'd say, and more willing to let other people take the lead. As you can probably tell, I'm a big talker and I dominate the precedings, and she always took a back seat, which to some degree, suited her nature, but I think it made her inherent shyness even worse. But she was quite good at recognizing ... She appreciated good writing, and I think she was one of those people who just instinctively said `Yeah. No.` And she didn't muck around too much. Pretty good. Yeah. And that's basically what partnerships do. That doesn't mean to say you can't work solely. I have been for quite some time for the last month, and you can do it. But the other person is a shit filter. You need shit filters and you need it, not just in that kind of partnership, you need it throughout your life. I was just sitting there. We were eating and I just said `Blah de blah.` I think I had been talking to my wife about it, and she said `Well, it's great. You just write about the kids.` And it was like `Yeah, of course I'm gonna write about the kids.` It was one of those obvious things like `Yes, no wonder we were put on the brief. I've got children.` Bang. Easy to write. [crosstalk 00:34:27]. Strained at times, but ultimately amiable. Certainly whilst we were making the ads. There was a little bit of distrust with one of the senior people there who was just nervous. On the client's side. And she kind of was on the shoot and didn't really constantly trust us, and that kind of manifested itself as lots of inane questions that were patronizing where it was somebody's just sheer insecurity coming out. Even though they're in the hands of people who know what they're doing. That was tiresome. But then there was a junior client who was there to balance that. She was kind of cool. She was American actually, and I hit it off with her and she was good, quite a fine mind and seemed more relaxed about stuff. Slightly more risk tolerant. And it stinks and at the end of it, in the middle of all of this is your idea, which doesn't give a shit about politics. It just wants to be. And you can't get rid of it. Clients try to, but you can't. You get attachment. Pretty good support I would say. Yes. They were there to defend it. Not so good when it came to the product stuff and the extra bit of extra messages that the client wanted to put in. They kind of rolled over, and I think there's often that point where the difference between great and good is usually just a 10% of client interference really, and you get that kind of moment where you've got something that's really quite pure on the paper and then because the client can't see it as an ad, they just add an extra tiny bit of another layer onto what is actually something really simple and then don't realize that what they're ultimately doing when it comes to the finished article is compromising it and that it actually becomes just slightly too complicated or slightly too many words or just a little less charming, whatever it might be. You get to that moment and you just think `Hmm.` And the client's pushing for it. And that's when the account team have to say `Hang on a minute, guys. Can we make that decision later?` And usually, if you stall and you come back to it, once you've got an edit, you can then turn around and say `Look, it doesn't work.` But on paper, you can say anything you like because you don't really have ... There's no substance there. So in a way, people can take more liberty with just a script. I think even a client will realize that when they actually have a commercial in front of them, they can't take those same sort of liberties, which is why it's so important to try and hold back all that stuff until the very end. And we still had trouble, even when we made the ad, because once you ... We were very clear about what we we were going to do, but it wasn't until they actually saw it that they, again, this is this lack of visualization ability, until they saw it in front of them, they couldn't quite grasp it. As you can probably tell, I'm a big talker and I dominate the precedings, and she always took a back seat, which to some degree, suited her nature, but I think it made her inherent shyness even worse. PROJECT ID But that kind of didn't matter until I started thinking about it, and then I suddenly realized, `Yes, of course, we draw on my own experience.` We were just talking about it and I just said, it was like `They're the children's experts. So experts, it's all about kids. Really, these guys know how kids behave, in other words. They know what they're like and they take these little guys really seriously. They're the experts. And they're not flippant about it.` It was something about that word `Serious` that made me think, `Right. It's all about that. Contrast some innocent play and take it seriously.` And I love that contrast, and that was where we started talking about it there and it was just like `Yeah, you know, like [crosstalk 00:34:01].` Yeah, she was. And we were like `Yeah, yeah, you know, we can talk about documentaries.` We were taking about ... At that time, I had seen Touching the Void and I had also read the book and it made a big impression on me and I thought `Great. That kind of very serious narrative over the top of something as silly as a kid on a living room floor,` and I thought `Great. Okay. Bang.` You already knew that was gonna be good. And that just clicked. On the client's side. And she kind of was on the shoot and didn't really constantly trust us, and that kind of manifested itself as lots of inane questions that were patronizing where it was somebody's just sheer insecurity coming out. Even though they're in the hands of people who know what they're doing. PROJECT ID And then the senior guy was incredibly risk averse and was an absolute prat right the way through, and constantly caused problems and particularly at the end, because he pulled power, rank, and undermined people below him who had taken, what I thought were good decisions, [inaudible 00:36:13]. It's just politics. They kind of rolled over, and I think there's often that point where the difference between great and good is usually just a 10% of client interference really, and you get that kind of moment where you've got something that's really quite pure on the paper and then because the client can't see it as an ad, they just add an extra tiny bit of another layer onto what is actually something really simple and then don't realize that what they're ultimately doing when it comes to the finished article is compromising it and that it actually becomes just slightly too complicated or slightly too many words or just a little less charming, whatever it might be.

There's no substance there. But there's this cute little girl in this completely innocuous place in the living room, and then playing those contrasts of this very serious documentary voice and this charming little girl having her own little pretend game was where the humor came from. Effortlessly got [Calpull 00:23:25] into it because she eventually gets a fever. Understandably, she's at sea. She's got sniffles. [Calpull 00:23:30] comes to the rescue, she can get on with playing. Who came in and we just pitched the idea to him. He read the scripts, loved them, came back with a very simple take on it, which was just to keep them very much like a tableau, just keep them really very sort of almost like a kind of single camera shot, static, watching these kids just almost as if through the keyhole, and it worked perfectly.  I think probably the reason I'm most proud of that and happiest about it is because I felt like it came from me. Sometimes when the ideas are really close to you, and they feel like your baby, you get more defensive about them if they start getting compromised. And this one didn't get compromised, so it was just fantastic. It was a real gilette, punch the air moment. And half the time, we're dealing with cartoons and animatics to explain a commercial idea, which the director is going to interpret different anyway. And you can imagine these clients just sitting there going `Well, I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.` Even the creatives aren't completely sure. They're completely lost.   Well, we had to fight them. We had to fight through research. We got through research. We did qual and quant research and we still had trouble with them. They were a very traditional, quite conservative. This is [Visor 00:28:18] we're talking about, so not exactly visionaries in an advertising sense.",

    "text": "Huge client. Big client. Really, really, this is the first big job, first piece of work that we had done for the client since we got the business. `We'd like to try and get something in front of them that just spins that. I've seen a couple versions of it done and I like it very much, can you have a go?` It was that relaxed, so I did. And I had an idea within an hour and a half, and it was just like, brilliant. It was just one of those moments where you just go `Yeah, that works.` Happy. Pressure was on, but it was such a stupid deadline that I relaxed. It was so unrealistic that I let everything, I just thought `Oh, fuck it. It doesn't matter.` And it just kind of freed up. Yeah. I was on my own on that one. So that's a difference to the [Calpull 00:42:02] one where I actually had somebody to shit filter. Risk tolerance is, at that point, pretty good actually. I think they were very good on risk. They were very ... They had a campaign that was already running. They knew it was a success. They knew the formula worked. So there was a kind of slightly more relaxed attitude to it. Here comes another in the series, you know what I mean. More confidence. Exactly. So yeah, good. I slotted into that and because they had all that in the back of their heads, they didn't have to research it.   Time was the big one when I was writing, and then after that ... Limitless. It was like .... Well, budget was never an issue. HSBC. They were really distant. I met the top guy, pitched the script. Actually, my crew director pitched the script and then I just met him for a pre-prod, and that was it. He just said `Yeah, I like it. Go ahead with it. You've got a really good director. See you later.` And it was just literally that simple. Well, the client group was probably, literally, I think there were only two decision makers on the client side. And in terms of the account team, there was only about, there's only really two people. So it's really tight. Helps. Yeah, yeah. You have a fall guy. You always to have one that they can kill. Well, that is psychology. You want to give the client, yeah, that power to veto Well, yeah, the illusion of options. Exactly. Massive pressure. That was entirely on my own. One, I'm originating a campaign. There is no precedent for it. That's [Calpull 00:44:50] and then you've got HSBC, where you just go `I'm the next one up.` PROJECT ID `So fuck the lot of you. This feels right to me.` Whereas with that one, you know you can be judged against three other ads. Yeah. Yeah, I had a tiny bit of input from another creative who helped out. They wanted a tiny bit more romance in the story. He added a little tiny sort of subplot, if that's possible to call it a subplot in 60 seconds. Which kind of helped. It was a, like `Can I carry your bags for you` kind of moment. Just a little bit more interaction. That helped. What else? Any other stuff? Obviously from the director himself who interpreted it and did some nice little things on the way. Apart from that little bit of help from this other creative who helped me whilst I was on holiday who just did basically a little tiny script polish to up the romance, there was no other outside help.",

    "text": "Yeah, it didn't feel like they were really confident. To be honest, I haven't really worked load. We're working on the HSBC thing now, but we haven't ever worked on the B-TV ads or anything, but as far as I know they're not that adventurous. Well I don't think the budget was very much, but time constraints probably wasn't, well, I don't think it was too bad, as far as I can remember - it was a couple of years ago. Normally, time's not a great thing. But - yeah, I don't think it was particularly bad on that. Well, no, normally they don't give you enough, or they have a briefing around for ages, and they give it to you with only a few days to work on it. But also, too much time on that thing...a lot of teams might not have enough time, but you give someone like a month or something, you won't work on it properly for a couple of weeks, so you won't really think about it properly until...so you can have too much time as well. I'd say we got a lot of common interests. I think the way we think's different. We know each other, we like the same sort of style of things. But he'll always say something, or I'll say, that's interesting, I didn't think of that. So often I might overcomplicate, and Craig always sees it in this sort of simple...he'll talk his mind, and he'll say, well that's just shit, innit? Which is, you go, it is quite shit, yeah. Yeah you do, yeah. And I think we work well together, basically, we've worked together for ages. Yeah, totally. I think we were just sort of joined together in our unhappiness. It's just that it was a really nice idea which should have happened, and they end up going with an idea which wasn't as good, which is really annoying. Well yeah there was our creative directors, Greg and Mike. They really liked the original idea, and there was nothing they could do about it, it turned out to be what it was. I don't think they did. I think it was them just deciding themselves. It probably was they knew that last time they did a golf thing they used this kind of silhouette which we ended up using. I think it's because they knew that worked, they thought, well then why don't we just be safe a bit. To be honest, I haven't really worked load. We're working on the HSBC thing now, but we haven't ever worked on the B-TV ads or anything, but as far as I know they're not that adventurous. Yeah, because basically they'd done the most, the lamest things, they went back to the campaign from the last year. So, they year before. [inaudible 00:16:01] reverted back to the -- I mean they managed to change it gradually, gradually back, and then it was just like the one from the year before, nothing like what we chose, is it? They would say change one thing, and that one thing turns into something else, and they go, well the year before we actually made this, we want to change this other thing. And then [inaudible 00:16:45] classic things they do is change a brief. But I feel with this, they might have just said, actually why don't we just go with last year's work and you just write new lines for it? I'd say we got a lot of common interests. I think the way we think's different. We know each other, we like the same sort of style of things. But he'll always say something, or I'll say, that's interesting, I didn't think of that.   Yeah, it was fine. We didn't really get to talk to them much. I think they were fine with the people who worked on the account team, and our creative directors. But I don't think we get enough contact, you know, with the clients, which is a shame. Why would you trust someone if you never met them, you know? I think we should definitely have more contact. Yeah as far as I can remember. So I don't think I really blame them for the client being lame. Not having any conflict. I think a lot of the time they kind of really know in the back of their mind they're gonna go with that anyway, but at least they'll just give you the brief and see if you can come up with anything else. And they always know they can go back to that. It's a safety thing.",

    "text": "Yeah, I think, because they probably give that a bit more leeway, the way that it's meant to be ludicrously tasty, so it's meant to be ludicrous fun. But it's still quite controlling on that, they're still quite afraid to do anything too mad. There's no risk takers, really, in this. Yeah there is, but you always finish...there is, because the whole idea is like one taste is meant to be ludicrous, he tastes, it's meant to be a ludicrous idea. So in the end it's got to be ludicrous. But then they're always...put a massive restraint on that. Not too ludicrous, not too ludicrous, it seems. Yeah, we wanted to shoot three, actually, so we wanted a bit more money and they wouldn't give it to us, so we had to shoot the third one for like next to nothing, so, the budget was... No, we shot that one when we got home, we shot it with a different director. It was supposed to....it's a bit of a long story actually. We thought the director that we got to shoot the two of them were gonna shoot the third one for next to nothing. When we got out there, we realized they weren't actually up for doing that, and we...I was quite upset by that actually. Got into a bit of an argument over it. I feel that was our producer's fault. It's a bit of a long story, really. I think our producer panicked, because they thought...all their job was to do was to get this thing signed off. But the way it was is that our favorite ad was the third one which the client -- was kind of the riskier one, which the client didn't want to shoot. They said do you think you can get that shot with the others, that's fine, but get the two shot that we've researched and that we like. If you get the third one shot with them that's fine. ...yeah, we're already out there and the first time we met, we'd never met him before. Spoke to him on the phone, and we got there, he's like, well...Craig said, actually, he's like well, you'd just said that, then we might not have gone with you, and we might have chose someone else. And that was the first time we'd met him, and he's shooting the next day and he's like, ahhh...But we were so upset by it [inaudible 00:37:59] Yeah, but I don't think it was their fault. I think it was the kind of thing that happened, I think our producers sort of misled it into thinking they were going to shoot it. Our producer here. Because I think she just wanted the job signed off. Because the client didn't' care about shooting the third one, the third one was more for me and Craig. Yeah. So the one that we really liked is the one that didn't get -- but then when we got back, we got someone else to shoot it. Yeah, seemed okay. Again, Kellogg's, they're quite conservative really, so, you don't really agree totally with what they're saying. But I think a lot of that probably could be sorted out if you had more contact with them. And that just doesn't seem to happen Yeah, always good, yeah. We always stick together on teams, so... So we never picked anyone, even the same in the case of the Crunchy Nut ads. And actually we start messing with them. One of them will come back over from Canada to do the grading and stuff in Soho. In the end we took it, we started changing so much, he said I just want my cut and I want to go back home. He sort of left it with us. That's happened quite a few times, but that's the way it goes. Yeah, [inaudible 00:42:26] the producer that was responsible, she organized the third one, so it got shot in the end, so it wasn't the end of the world and it turned out okay. I'll get them for you, you can look at them. It was kind of an obvious thing, it was kind of blatant really, what they were doing, but it was [inaudible 00:33:45] because it was so blatant, because they're obviously saying eat more, so, spend more money. So we just caught the line, it's like, get home and have some. It's just about people getting home as quick as possible so they can have their Crunchy Nut Cornflakes. To get home in sort of ridiculous, ludicrous ways. And that was quite enjoyable and that got bought pretty easily. But it's still quite controlling on that, they're still quite afraid to do anything too mad. And our producers gave us the impression that our directors were up for doing that. Then we got out there, they said no, there's not enough time. And then we got into a bit of an argument about, oh, if you had told us that... Craig said, actually, he's like well, you'd just said that, then we might not have gone with you, and we might have chose someone else. And that was the first time we'd met him, and he's shooting the next day and he's like, ahhh...But we were so upset by it Again, Kellogg's, they're quite conservative really, so, you don't really agree totally with what they're saying. But I think a lot of that probably could be sorted out if you had more contact with them. And that just doesn't seem to happen No, it never seems to happen. You don't get enough contact. I don't blame the clients for being sort of suspicious of us, because if you've never met someone, then why would you trust them? Yeah, that was kind of weird. I think it got there in such a panic situation with the producer, and I don't think she realized how much we wanted it. It was just a funny, well it wasn't funny, it was really annoying at the time, but that's the way it goes. Because you're always under pressure aren't you?   We still had those, two other ads to shoot, so, the next day we were shooting the two other ads, so it was kind of just a bad way to start the shoot, really, because it was like hold on...I don't really know, I don't know to this day how it happened. We were totally under the impression, Craig and I were under the impression that this other ad was gonna get shot. So it was a bit of a shock. No, I think that they turned out quite well, the ads. I don't think the directors knew, we haven't really shot with anyone which we thought, that's brilliant, we'll use them again. We've always been quite critical of...whenever we shoot and ad, it's often like, when you see the first cut, we're never happy with it, and that's always like...you turn on, you see, that's really disappointing. And we saw a mess of it a lot. Yeah, and if you put them in a room with strangers and they think, well what should I be saying? [crosstalk 00:43:55] put mums together and they all think...",

Then it just basically began to unravel because you were dealing with lots of different people and I think this is a little bit like what you were talking about.

It was the opposite of a flat, it was very sort of, we had to try and keep him happy, we had to try and keep the client happy. The client was being threatened with redundancy at the time so his head wasn't in the right place. The brand as a whole, didn't really know what they were doing, what they were trying to say. Very confused by the message. They started off wanting to say one thing then changed it. Just like a series of events which basically kept doing weren't enough and we worked on it for about four months and just kept dealing with it, kept dealing with it. Then always trying to please everybody and in the end it just basically, we had to walk away really and say you all want different things. Unless you all agree on what you want and in the end I think someone is doing it now. Said the same thing. I think it's probably because it's the most recent. but then there's the other side which is the ones that you really hate is the ones where you think you've got something amazing and somebody destroys it for a number of reasons. I could probably say, probably not here but British telecom campaign we did at Abbott Meade which we did so much work for and we ended up doing I think 16 ads for BT before that point so we had a really good relationship with them and we did some really nice work for them and we got to this stage where broadband was just really coming in and they wanted a massive campaign to talk, to tell the customers about what they wanted but it was a bit of a funny situation because we were doing it at Abbott Meade and another agency was involved because we both trying to pitch for this account but they wanted us to work together so it was a bit strange. I think basically the ones that you, I maybe give you a different perspective on the ones that are a real nightmare because there's ones like that Knorr project which were a nightmare as far as so painful every step of the way but then there's the other side which is the ones that you really hate is the ones where you think you've got something amazing and somebody destroys it for a number of reasons. They could've made a great campaign and I think it's because I went away on a holiday and I came back and something had happened. Either they'd given it some loot or they wanted something totally different so they totally changed their mind. There was no way out of it. There's no saving it. We were trying to have meetings where we would talk about ideas and it all got a bit you know their end game they're going to try and stab your idea in the back because is obviously it's all been very nice in the meeting but then maybe saying something like, `Well, maybe you've seen that before somewhere else.` We were trying to have meetings where we would talk about ideas and it all got a bit you know their end game they're going to try and stab your idea in the back because is obviously it's all been very nice in the meeting but then maybe saying something like, `Well, maybe you've seen that before somewhere else.` That vibe wasn't very good but we worked on it for about four or five months we just got some scripts that we were happy with. They could've made a great campaign and I think it's because I went away on a holiday and I came back and something had happened. Either they'd given it some loot or they wanted something totally different so they totally changed their mind. There was no way out of it. There's no saving it. I think it's because you put so much effort and it was along the way yes, yes, yes. And then to totally shift that was probably the most deflated I've ever been in advertising because like Knorr products you just annoyed all the way along but you know what I mean? This painful, like almost painful, painful, painful, painful, but in the end it's like, `Ah, sod it.` Whereas that one was like, this going to be great, this is going to be great, this is going to be great and nothing's happening. Is that maybe a different take on it? In the end they made something totally different which was about these little, it was almost like inside a computer and all these people were, it was like being inside the internet but those people get making things happen. Then they did, what that it or they did one big ad in a coliseum which was a massive, a two million pound production or something. It was quite different from where we were going. Our were all different, it was basically connecting you with, it was connecting you with the internet so because their internet was infinitely varies you could connect to with an infinite amount of things so creatively it was like a maze and you could just do that with hardly any restrictions. All you had to really do was create something that you think people would like so people who loved Elvis were, we did scripts around that, someone meeting Elvis who was a big Elvis fan and it was just, it was a very creative rich territory. I can't really remember what the final scripts was because it was a whole big campaign but it was just very creatively rich and one of those things that they had the money to do it and it was all looking good and it would've been a big, big campaign for us personally and for BT. I think that's what made it even worse as well. Yeah, but they seemed like they were, they narrowed down and then there was a big change. I'm not exactly sure why. Maybe a little bit in the risk taking. Maybe. I'd say it was more probably political from the two different agencies. I'd say that was probably the overlying factor. Some CEOs with cigars or something. Something happened. I think they took the long term approach as far as to be a bit ... They still held the accounts. It wasn't a case of them going into the CEO of BT and being like, `What the hell are you doing? Why are you doing this?` It was just sometimes you have to go, okay. Yep. Fair enough. Quite pragmatic about it. They're still paying the agency a lot of money so. I think basically you do get, sometimes you have prejudices come into account if you've had a bad experience on that account sometimes you do bring that on but I think I suppose that's why me and Lawrence is chaps as well is we try just to keep going and we do believe that you can do a good idea for anything. It's just about keeping your standards high and saying I want to do another good ad.  think I suppose that's why me and Lawrence is chaps as well is we try just to keep going and we do believe that you can do a good idea for anything. It's just about keeping your standards high and saying I want to do another good ad. I think what happens if you keep doing it and they keep saying no then you'll likely just get to a stage where you just don't want to work on it again. That's quite tough to keep going and keep going but sometimes you have to.

We did a load for them before and then they wanted a follow on thing. I'm not exactly sure but when we were working on that brief the broadband one, the start the very open yeah, they just wanted it. Project brief was quite scary because it was quite big. The thing is we're never, because we've been courses like mind mapping courses and we've been through all that. I don't think we employ any actual contactics or anything like that. I think we just do what we do naturally. What we normally do is we both think about the problem for a bit and then one of us we have a little idea so we talk about it and see if that sparks off anything. I suppose it is mind mapping because you're bouncing off each other. It just goes, it's got the ability to go off in different directions so you're using it that way really. I think that's probably the main route that we use. We don't go too far down a line individually before we start talking because I think that's quite bad. You might as well work on your own if you're just going to do that because if you're going to think of an idea and then go, `What'd you think of that?` You might as well say that to your creative director. I think it's try and talk earlier if you can. Yeah but the people who were really making the decisions we weren't really talking to them that much. I think that's a factor. It was always like we were both, I think because we both really pissed off so it was nobody's fault. I can't think of a situation where you'd think, `Oh, that was your fault that it didn't.` You know what I mean. you might say, `Oh you didn't come up with very much today but you wouldn't say that anyway. It's not [inaudible 00:50:48] related by it, do you know what I mean? He's just as pissed off as I am. Yeah we had to get a relationship with them. They were pissed off as well. I think it was literally it was a political thing or something happened in a late stage that we didn't know about. Sometimes that's really frustrating. You get it and something happens that you haven't heard or totally out of left field that you have no kind of say in or you have no control in. You can solve problems if you can help solve the problem you feel like you're in a bit more control but if things come out of nowhere that you've got no control over or you can have no say in, it's really hard because it takes all your job away, takes all your power away.   I think basically you do get, sometimes you have prejudices come into account if you've had a bad experience on that account sometimes you do bring that on but I think I suppose that's why me and Lawrence is chaps as well is we try just to keep going and we do believe that you can do a good idea for anything.",

One that's all clicked, I think the thing about that is that's ones in the past and you always look back and you think, `Oh didn't that work so smoothly?` It was great and you got a really good ad out of it. Probably I think it goes back to a client really. We had our two best clients, one was actually a McDonald's client, this was quite a few years ago but he was very matter of fact, very straightforward and if he didn't like it he would say he wouldn't like it but if he did like it he had the power to go, `Oh, I would make that.` He didn't do any research and his tone of what he wanted to do was everybody knew it and it was about trying to do these nice [inaudible 00:14:24] advertising and have a nice tone and trying to get this kind of message across.

We did probably about seven projects with him and they were our most successful as far as award wise as well but they were probably our most successful in the fact that it was hard work and there's always about standard and script but then once you've got a really good script and again this might be looking back [inaudible 00:14:55] he did seem to buy it and then he had faith within the agency and in the team to produce it. I would say that was pretty good and then I think a lot of it falls down to the client. I really think you can write good advertising on any brand on any product. It was hard work and there's always about standard and script but then once you've got a really good script and again this might be looking back [inaudible 00:14:55] No, I didn't know that but that was because it was, that was situation was good because he was very, working on those briefs with him, they were tricky but you just had that feeling as if all you really had to worry about was coming up with the idea and making it good enough whereas with most clients that's not the big hurdle anymore.",

In a way it was a bit of a [inaudible 00:16:53] brief to say to try and grow your hair but he was again, he was very straightforward. He was a little bit crazy but he was very inspirational as far as he would come and go. I want some really good ads, he really believed that good ads were going to to sell his products and he was right because they did. We just wrote a few campaigns for him and again he didn't buy everything. You'd go and present him some stuff and he be, `Guys this is not quite right,` but it was one of those things we got to the stage where if we wrote something that we really believed in, we knew what was right for the brand and say when we went to present it we mostly knew that he would buy it and again he didn't do any research he just went if he believed that was right he would sign off the money and he would go make it. Those were the two best because I think that's the best scenario if you've got a client who is powerful enough to make things happen and who's strong enough character to believe in his own judgment and I know it's tricker now because you have to do research, you have to prove to certain bosses and other people that this is going to work but people with a really strong drive I find are the best clients because they say, `Look, this is what I want.` It's not always easy but if you give them what they want they'll say yeah. Those were the two best because I think that's the best scenario if you've got a client who is powerful enough to make things happen and who's strong enough character to believe in his own judgment and I know it's tricker now because you have to do research, you have to prove to certain bosses and other people that this is going to work but people with a really strong drive I find are the best clients because they say, `Look, this is what I want.` It's not always easy but if you give them what they want they'll say yeah. Rob and I find lots and lots of clients now just default to, I won't ever make the decision. I'll see what certain people think. It all meanders away but he was the best and he was a really good guy as well. He was quite funny and it always was just an enjoyable thing working on that. We got some good ads out of it as well that we were very happy with. Rob and I find lots and lots of clients now just default to, I won't ever make the decision. I'll see what certain people think.  It all meanders away but he was the best and he was a really good guy as well. He was quite funny and it always was just an enjoyable thing working on that. We got some good ads out of it as well that we were very happy with. Yeah, but this was the good thing about it, I think he had a situation where he had the trust of his bosses that he ran this account and I think obviously Pfizer, big company. They're a pretty scary company and I imagine they researched the hell out of everything but he somehow whether they trusted him enough, he ran the account. Yeah, he was particularly risk tolerant because he realized how he needed to stand out within his market and he wanted a point of difference and he knew that in that area there's lots of ads that people didn't believe and he just wanted communication which he had a very factual message but he wanted to do it in an entertaining way because he believed that was the best way to target his audience and he was right. It's not often you get a client who's got exactly the same beliefs and mentality as you. I think that's the same in any walk of life, if you meet someone who's going in the same direction as you it makes everything easy. When people all going different directions when it gets hard. It's pretty straight, it's basically they had a claim where, what was the exact claim? Where one out of five people it definitely grew your hair back. That was their claim. Don't know how they came to that but they had a pretty strong claim. That was the brief but we just, we actually did a campaign about there are many myths around Regaine has, so we did it on the bizarre myths around regrowing hair. That allowed us to down a slightly comedy route and obviously sell their product benefit. It was good. Budget was pretty good. It was a global budget and two 60 second ads so it was quite a big budget. Again because of Pfizer I suppose they had the money. That was pretty good. As long as he was happy he would feed it through. I think the structure was a bit flat you might say and so the agency helped but it didn't have to do as much as it would've done if what was [inaudible 00:32:00] office with having to deal with trying to sell the end as well and there was never ... South African office was trying to sell it in there and the Australian office was trying to sell it in there. I think it was because he had the power he didn't have to do that much really. Those were the two best because I think that's the best scenario if you've got a client who is powerful enough to make things happen and who's strong enough character to believe in his own judgment I think we're similar in our approach. We're both quite dedicated as we're both have that same mentality if we keep going we keep going and we're quite similar in that methodical aspect of the work. I'd say probably our brains work quite differently in a he'll say stuff that I would never say and I say stuff he would never say. His personality's quite different to mine. God, I don't know really. We just were talking. Most of our ideas just come through talking so we talk about project and one of us might say something and then the other person might say something and then go, `Oh yeah.` That's the way it normally starts. No, I remember we thought of the strategy about there are lots of myths out there that this is the proven way to regrow your hair, I remember that came first and then we just started thinking about funny rituals about ways and then started looking and researching how some country there's actual are myths out there about how people try and regrow their hair and so came to a bit of research factor as well looking into it. Very good. Very good. I think he'd been at the agency before so he had a relationship with some of the account people. They were good. I think it was a solid base anyway. He wasn't worrying about the, oh is this agency any good. He just had faith in the agency so that was good. So we were on a good start.   I think it was one of those things, you always, we had a good relationship with them that you're always going to have differences of opinions about things. There were differences of opinions but there's never any big arguments. It's just like, we think that, you think that, we think that. Back and forth back and forth. You want to do that, you want to do that. As long as he was happy he would feed it through. I think the structure was a bit flat",

    "text": "The production guy, the creative guy. No, one person. Which was a good model. One person is definitely a good one. Sure, committees are dreadful. Individuals are good. Is very small. If you're a multinational petroleum manufacturer, inevitably your risk on everything is smaller rather than larger. Don't take that away from them. In regard to this job they pushed with us and helped us to do something good for them. Yeah, it was pretty good. It was pretty good. I think that when you have something that everyone can see why they might get excited about it, and see the potential, and see the possibility, it always tends to make life a bit easier. On this occasion we were lucky that people could see that, and research agreed which was good. Yeah. I mean, there's pressure. There's always pressure when messing around five million dollars with someone else's money and understandingly they wanted us to get it right. There's pressure, but there's experience. There's understanding. There's respect. There's knowledge. You use those tools well and it doesn't have to be conflictual or combative. There is pressure on for all of you to get together and do the best job in every respect. That definitely exists, and that definitely helps the job but it's not something that's scary or limiting or frightening to deal with. It's just inevitably there because, back to my original point about commerce and art meeting. You're naïve if you think there isn't going to be a lot of pressure around the commerce side, clients. Things are going well. There's no need to senior management involve themselves. This was a go. Everything I wanted was in place. I got support from my boss and our partners on the business. No complaints. They were all great. On this occasion it was great. Because they knew that the job was full of difficulty in terms of the logistics and the practicalities of the job. They recognized that conquering those difficulties would be part of making the film memorable and lastingly special. We collaborated intensely with each other to overcome those obstacles that would all be fair. Normally duality in a brief is a difficult thing, but we found a way, which is probably one of the tougher parts of the brief, to fuse the two things together so it didn't feel like, `Let me tell you this, and no one by the way hears this as well,` which I think pays off well in the film. Yeah. It was at this desk, written by me and two infinitely more talented junior guys. We sat around here. It was about 1:30 at night when we wrote Circuit. Again, it's normal for us. When it comes, you don't know, just as long as it comes. Getting a little bit older, 29, each. Again, one of the fabulous things about that is when you're involved with that, I'm not the senior guy and they're the junior guys. I'm not the old guy and they're the young guys. It's just we're three guys around the table, trying to sort out a problem with a good solution. That's one of the nicest things, because nothing else matters other than that. I'm sure that's nice for them too. Ultimately we're not suits. We are creative people in casual clothes trying to think of something and not really caring about too much else. They're from similar working background and probably working class, called blue collar, gifted, super hard working, fast learners, everything I like in a young creative team. The team I work with were the best young creative team I've ever hired and worked with. They're just exceptional and they were doing everything that I already admire, what I'm looking for in teams. They were the embodiment of those things. It was a pleasure to work with them. They're great, but really talented. Determined and we like working with each other. There's pressure there, but there's no point getting around a table and, `Woo, there's pressure.` [Crosstalk 00:27:58] is going to kill you. The discipline is to put a shield in between you and that and go, `Okay, guys, what were we going to do here?` Like you might imagine, that when you get rid of all the guff and the system and the formality and the bureaucracy, it's a breath of fresh air when it's actually just us and we got the path in front of us and the brief on the side. We're ready to get at it. That's a relief that you got to that stage, and a desire just to write something that you can all get jazzed about. Well, the key thing is respect. It really is. It can be a difficult thing, to broker that. There's a lot of different dynamics at play. Quite often your client won't be the ultimate decision maker, but will have to represent your joined view to someone above them because they're too important to come to meetings. Sometimes there's better chemistry than other times. The key thing is to try and understand each other. If I was one, I'd want the same. I'd want some ROI, some return on investment. Our job's to get it to them. Again, nothing unusual, nothing extraordinary about this particular job. It's just it was, it's there. It was there. It got dealt with.   I like working with them a lot. You're working with really high end people. You sharpen up before you do business with them, and they're only there to help us top, top, top, get the thing up to the best they can possibly be. That's a thrill, doing that. It's exciting, watching the end part of the development take place, all good, all good. It's really nice to work with top people. Definitely you get a buzz out of it, definitely improves the performance.",

    "text": "Well the thing is, I mean it ... you know, I'm not dodging your question but the reason behind lots of things, they create a reputation for being prima donnas or aggressive, or explosive or difficult or nitroglycerine by nature is ... isn't really true. Because you have to understand the way it is, is that us and ... you know it's not to knock the account people, their absolutely fundamental to success as are the planners, as are the management and the offices. It's just that as a creative manager, sometimes you feel slightly alone, in terms of how I am for creative purity. It's I'm not so sure that we should do this, or I really believe in celebrity endorsement, or I like coke advertising but you're not coke. So you know, because the gigantic amount of subjectivity that always exists, and if you think about the other creative professions I've mentioned, music, architecture, TV, along with advertising, it is profoundly subjective by nature. And it's that conflict that's usually caused by the people who have been doing it for a living for a long time and the people who are paying for it who feel that by paying for it, they are entitled to influence, sometimes, the content. Not all the cases, I have plenty of good clients as well who understand that, that's not a good thing. Because, let me tell you something ... what we really believe in it. The battery of evidence suggests that if you take a proposition and you throw enough money behind it, you will see an effect in the marketplace. A positive effect in the marketplace, unless there's extreme mitigation not to do so. So that's not what we believe in. What we believe in, that with the same spend behind it, a better idea will be more effective than a mediocre one. But you know and again you understand, you mustn't understand too much because our job is to defend the pure and the uncompromised and it's absolutely what we're her to do, I'd say more than that, that's what we ... more than anything else, that's what we get paid for. To broker away from that and back to, the best possible vision of the idea that we've had. In all its different forms, for that brief, for that product, on the brand right now.  ... I had a British Rail ad once, in which I had a script very, very nearly approved and then the chairman blew it out and I had to rewrite it in 12 hours. And it was a different idea and it was a bad idea. But you know, the pressures were at the time, as is always the case with these things pretty irresistible. But they were causal to its lack of appeal. Its uselessness its finality. Yeah. I mean that's the thing for us, more than anywhere else, you see something come on that you've done, that you like and it's a great feeling. What was in my head is now on the screen in front of 30 million people and I'm proud of it. And I feel really good about it but I don't have the downside of fame. Like an actor would see a piece of work he'd done and feel that way or not that way. But believe you me when it's not very good, it kills you. It just kills you, it really hurts. So that's why we fight hard to make sure there are less of that kind of and more of the other kind. So I had a British Rail film out there that I thought was mean, embarrassed when I saw it. I mean there had been others but that one I remember being particularly uncomfortable when I saw it. So it's ... No, and also what is he doing? He's meant to be running the company, what's he doing judging one off regional copy. But that's part of our business, it's ... on craft I used to have the worldwide CEO host the copy review and the minutiae of ... you know, as his brand went to hell in a hand cart and Wall Street was screaming at him, he was worried about angel wing size. So you know, we deal with a lot of sort of unusual stuff and you wouldn't believe, every ad that gets made, that you see on TV that's a great ad, really deserves to be awarded and applauded because its run the grand national four times in a row without any break or water to get over all of those fences cleanly, and to arrive in the finisher's winner's ring. That's why 80% of the stuff you see out there is mediocre or worse. And just the top echelon, the cream at the top of the bottle is the stuff that's so very, very good because of those ... the possibility of death by any one of the thousand cuts, can occur at any time. Deeply hierarchical, deeply. And old fashioned in an awful way. Well low but, as a consequence of so many people really not understanding how to deal with creativity agencies. I mean, that's a real difficulty. Marketing tends to be a very multifaceted discipline. So it's Monday, I'm talking to the guy that runs the vending machines, Tuesday I'm talking about distribution, Wednesday I'm talking about pricing. Oh hello it's Thursday, the agency's here with it's creative ideas. Who's going to be good at all those things do you think BAHU? Very few would be the answer. Because they're wildly different skillsets. Yet they're all lumped in under this marketing thing. And that's why anyone, particularly on the creative side who works in an agency, although not exclusively on the creative side, will know that there's gigantic variety in what you're going to get given, in terms of the human being on the other side of the table. And sometimes you get lucky and it's sweet and it's fantastic and you go thank you lord. And other times it's desperate because you just have someone who's on a different planet from you and has no capacity to understand what you're saying or why you're saying it. Or to see what it is that you're proposing. So they were putting some extraordinary offers on the table to encourage that. You know, it would have been an interesting idea. But having to replace an idea that had been in [inaudible 00:13:54] for two months with one you had to come up with in 12 hours is never going to lead really, to the kind of result you want. This was, you know ... the track was good which was, People all over the world ... Love Train, Love Train it was. And only in the last few years can I listen to that song and really enjoy it. But it just wasn't ... It's just one of those ones that once it gets of the leash, it's going to be different degrees of bad. Yeah, you give it all and you have a shot and then you kind of spend and ... and then. You know it's better to hand it over. I mean of course you're not frustrated that it's going to another team, you're frustrated that what you did, which you love, didn't happen. Because, you know, what can I say? It's like sex, you know. The enthusiasm for the first time can never be replicated on the second time. No matter how good the second time is. It's that your first one is the one you really, really connect to and if that didn't go well then the next ones going to be harder. Yeah, exactly. Let him have a go. It's a bit like that, it's professionally necessary of course to get up off the deck and go again. And that is A. Necessary, B. An admirable quality, and C. Something you're going to have to do if you want this as your profession. It's the chance that it's gonna be as good as the first one ... it's possible, it's unlikely. That's the truth. Well, maybe it would be, but I mean yeah, and that would be the fundamental reason for doing it. And so I mean, look at that Christmas card how ... don't mention that I ... How shit is that. I mean honestly, I mean look at the budget you've got, I mean the girl's teeth aren't even white. It's just hideous, its cliché, corporate ... Well, you know ... I mean it's what we do. I mean, we can't be too precious about stuff. This stuff happens. But everyone was extremely disappointed when ... And that's what happens sometimes is that, right on the cusp of success, someone comes in and pisses on your ships, BAHU, and that's not nice. On that one? Really poor. I mean, really poor. The guy was a mess and had an enormous mental break down about three weeks after we finished the job. Strong. I mean, adversity bonds you together as well as good times. Good. Especially on the creative side. You looking to your creative director on things like that. I'd say most creative teams are very tough on themselves. They don't need some big old fat guy to come in and say ` You really fucked that up` when you know that it got fucked up. Yeah. It flattens out. The system is a system of banners and creatives and account people were in charge of different things and inevitably there's potential for conflict within that system and that conflict is more likely to be realized during difficulty than not. So, I think the thing is that you really, everyone makes an effort not to take it personally. They're explosive situations and ... I mean let me be honest with you, if the idea is not a belcher in the first place, nothing that can happen to it after that presentation will save it. Right? So, if it's a shitter at the beginning it's never gonna be anything other than a shitter. What we believe in, that with the same spend behind it, a better idea will be more effective than a mediocre one. But you know and again you understand, you mustn't understand too much because our job is to defend the pure and the uncompromised and it's absolutely what we're her to do, I'd say more than that, that's what we ... more than anything else, that's what we get paid for. To broker away from that and back to, the best possible vision of the idea that we've had. In all its different forms, for that brief, for that product, on the brand right now. One silver bullet ... silver bullet solutions are much rarer than people believe they are. And it was a different idea and it was a bad idea. But you know, the pressures were at the time, as is always the case with these things pretty irresistible. But they were causal to its lack of appeal. Its uselessness its finality. He just subjectively didn't like it. All of the ... Eleven people underneath him saw it and approved it. And it was researched with the consumer, and this guy spontaneously and subjectively didn't like it. I mean, that's a real difficulty. Marketing tends to be a very multifaceted discipline. So it's Monday, I'm talking to the guy that runs the vending machines, Tuesday I'm talking about distribution, Wednesday I'm talking about pricing. Oh hello it's Thursday, the agency's here with it's creative ideas. Who's going to be good at all those things do you think BAHU? Very few would be the answer. Yeah, I mean you know, here's the difficulty, I mean I'll you what they are. They were ... there were 11 people, 10 of whom couldn't say yes. So those 10 people, the best thing they contributed was not saying no. When it finally reached the guy who could say yes, he said no. So, what kind of a system is that, you wouldn't design it, if you were asked to design a buying system at Harvard. The winning entry would not be that. So they were putting some extraordinary offers on the table to encourage that. You know, it would have been an interesting idea. But having to replace an idea that had been in [inaudible 00:13:54] for two months with one you had to come up with in 12 hours is never going to lead really, to the kind of result you want.  mean of course you're not frustrated that it's going to another team, you're frustrated that what you did, which you love, didn't happen. But if you can't get used to that then, you're not going to have a long career as a creative in advertising. Even the very best creative agencies ... all stuff dies for all teams at some point. And you can get in any agency around here into ruts in and onto rolls and neither last forever. And you know, that's how it goes. It's the chance that it's gonna be as good as the first one ... it's possible, it's unlikely. That's the truth. It's hideous. So you know that's the challenge of ... there you go, your challenge is your Christmas card. Let's see your imagination, the stuff I'm countering every day, oh here it is, look at it. I mean ... shit Yeah, the first one got approved and it wasn't' a problem but they ... you know it's surprising what happens. And I say it's the nature of being a semi profession if you like is that ... I wish I had a penny for every time I had a conversation which there was a gigantic incontrovertible body of evidence in front of the client. And they go something like, it's good, it's good, but is good the enemy of great? And that awful uniformed airport book stand quality of thinking can in a nanosecond lead to a complete re brief, six weeks more work. Off something as vacuous and as uninformed as that. And there you go, there you go. Yeah, the biggest constraint was client IQ. That was the greatest barrier to success. `Quite liked your book, it's not really finished but I'll tell you what, I've got a Geordie art director in at the moment that we like the look of. No one can understand a word he says, if you can, you can go and sit with him for three weeks.` So that was my in. And we got on really, really well and worked together for about eight years. So he wanted me to work with him so he made it easier. And he drew up all my book and ... because I was shit at drawing, still am. And so he really helped me get ... because he wanted me to be his writer so he helped. So that's how you get in. Sometimes you need a bit of help. Which I felt, I know it was unavoidable in both instances, and entirely based on merit but it was a very, very difficult thing to have to do. One of them is dead, unfortunately, and the other is alive and understood why I had to do what I had to do. But he now works the freelance circuit and he has a different life. He's divorced from his wife who ran off with and elderly headmaster. She finally left. Really fancied an academic man. Watch out for that though. And he's now ... lives ... he's got his own place. Got a brilliant daughter between them who of course he sees. And is shacked up with a french girl, and he works his life differently.  Every taxi driver in London just to say JWT and they'd take you to 40 Berkeley Square. The eighth floor bar was once Frank Sinatra's flat. Really poor. I mean, really poor. The guy was a mess and had an enormous mental break down about three weeks after we finished the job. No, the agency is there where there is an agency, don't get me wrong. They don't just pin you out to dry. But there are situations that are unbrokerable and it's JFDI stuff and you just have to do it and we're a service industry and those are difficult. Period. It's always ... You're going to have a few of those and they're never, ever fun. Really, they're difficult. Same for them. They share their load. Of course they don't feel it quite as personally and because they are kind of semi responsible for the client behavior then they probably have to take a few jabs on the chin.   The system is a system of banners and creatives and account people were in charge of different things and inevitably there's potential for conflict within that system and that conflict is more likely to be realized during difficulty than not. So, I think the thing is that you really, everyone makes an effort not to take it personally. They're explosive situations and ... We're not casual and le se faire about stuff. It's serious stuff, weirdly. So, yeah. No. I mean, if you're not in it your view's not really required. There are too many views as it is. So, it's neither here nor there really.",

    "text": "Terrible project? Well, Smirnoff. It's the first thing we did when we got here, and we came up with this concept. It's funny, we just got briefed again to do the TV for it, which we're trying to do differently, but it just wouldn't die. We came up with this concept for, it's these pretty mixed drinks. It's like mojitos and cocktails and whatever, and so the whole idea was the mix is already perfected, so you just work on the pour or whatever. We had all these ambient ideas on how to do it, like Times Square board where we had this bottle and it would bounce off of another billboard. We make a fake fashion, like a girl with an umbrella, and it would bounce off the umbrella and into something else, and then finally land on this other billboard that's way down here, talking about the perfect pour or mastering your pour. We had all these non-traditional flip out things and we're like cool, these are awesome. We go in and they present it and they're like oh yeah, we love all this, and then this started a six month time period of slowly just chopping away until okay, there's no ambient, okay, let's dumb this down. Can you make that more obvious, can we get the logo bigger, can we do this, can we do that to it, until it was basically just a glorified product shot. It was just like, and it was just aggravating. There was nothing creative left to it. They just, bit by bit, in the slow process, they just took every bit of creativity out of it, and made it the bane of our existence. It just wouldn't go away. Even after we got done with it, just constantly, now this has to run in this newspaper, can you look at these spreads or whatever, and change this, bring this up, da da da, take it up to the studio, they don't do it. No, bring this, so it's ongoing, then finally I was like, I'm not doing it myself. Every time, I ended up doing it myself. It was just horrible, it was terrible. I'm hoping that the TV, I just got briefed on it yesterday. Hopefully we'll redeem ourselves. Five on the client side, and then it changed in between. It started out with we were answering to Jeremy, and then transferred over to Matt and Damian, who they just got it. They don't really care about it, because they just got it handed to them. They just wanted to get it out of the way. We wanted to get it out of the way, we wanted it to be done. In fact, there'd be emails coming back and forth, like we need this, we need this. Okay, can we put this to bed now? We'd be typing this reply all, thank god it's done. Yeah, there's quite a bit on Diageo side quite a bit of bureaucracy, start off with three nice people, turned into five, and then had to go answer to global. It was a global brand, they were taking that concept and using it in Italy, they're going to use it in France, and it stopped in France. There's all these people that had to answer. It's ridiculous, and I just shut out to that after a while. Do whatever, I don't care anymore. Well, we had to answer to our CD, and then we take that to the client, and we met with three clients, and they all talked about it, and then all of a sudden, towards the end, two more jumped in, so there was five on the client side. Yeah, I think that's it. Five on the client side, and then it changed in between. It started out with we were answering to Jeremy, and then transferred over to Matt and Damian, who they just got it. They don't really care about it, because they just got it handed to them. They just wanted to get it out of the way. We wanted to get it out of the way, we wanted it to be done. In fact, there'd be emails coming back and forth, like we need this, we need this. Okay, can we put this to bed now? We'd be typing this reply all, thank god it's done. Yeah, there's quite a bit on Diageo side quite a bit of bureaucracy, start off with three nice people, turned into five, and then had to go answer to global. It was a global brand, they were taking that concept and using it in Italy, they're going to use it in France, and it stopped in France. There's all these people that had to answer. It's ridiculous, and I just shut out to that after a while. Do whatever, I don't care anymore. I don't know. It was hard because it was my first project, and I think I probably could have pushed harder and I just didn't know. I didn't realize, I just went with it and said okay, okay. Maybe I could have done better work, maybe I could have got them to take more of a risk. I'm definitely going to push them now and see, especially since we have a new client. I think, I'm going to say low. I'm going to say very low, actually, because they did kill all the ambient stuff. Yeah. In fact, yeah, it turned into, low, very low. It was with doing the ambient stuff. That's what they'll go to, that's the go-to thing is no money, no money. If an idea's good enough, they'll find money, they just don't want to do it. Yeah, I mean, there was enough budget to do all the print ads and basic stuff, but when it came to doing anything different, there was no budget for it. I don't know if that helps. Time was okay, it went pretty quickly, actually. We started in January on it, and then I think we were shooting, we shot it in February or March. I think February, it went pretty quickly. No, my family was up by then, so yeah, it was shot in March. It was in magazines by June. Then now the Times Square just went up by December, a December launch. With worked with Stu, that got fired. [inaudible 00:51:21], he was the best account dude ever. He'd fight for you, he fought, you know? He was just a blast to work with. The project manager on it, who also quit, was great. I loved working with her. Josh and I were excited just to work, you know? We got a job, we were excited. It went from excitement to definitely jaded, pissy, not liking it at all. n fact, we got introduced to some of the new account person, and I guess she thought I was mean or something. I was, because she was like, it was her first day or whatever, and she was briefing us or wanting us to do something. I just wanted to know, okay, what does this really mean? I just wanted to know, don't sugarcoat it, what does it really mean? I don't know, I guess I was mean. In fact, we got introduced to some of the new account person, and I guess she thought I was mean or something.

I just wanted to know, don't sugarcoat it, what does it really mean? I don't know, I guess I was mean. People are sensitive. I mean, you can't be. I wanted her to be honest. I wasn't giving her a hard time or anything. I got jaded from it, yeah. The mood went sour. There was this one dude that came in towards the end that I didn't like. He was like ooh, I didn't like that. He had another [inaudible 00:53:21]. I swear, it's the most global company ever. Yeah, but we're bitching to each other. It's like, we're in it together. It's like, it's not his fault, it's not my fault, we're blaming everybody else together, you know what I mean, how it is. You got a little compadre. We go in and they present it and they're like oh yeah, we love all this, and then this started a six month time period of slowly just chopping away until okay, there's no ambient, okay, let's dumb this down. Can you make that more obvious, can we get the logo bigger, can we do this, can we do that to it, until it was basically just a glorified product shot. It was just like, and it was just aggravating. There was nothing creative left to it. There's all these people that had to answer. It's ridiculous, and I just shut out to that after a while. Do whatever, I don't care anymore. Well, we had to answer to our CD, and then we take that to the client, and we met with three clients, and they all talked about it, and then all of a sudden, towards the end, two more jumped in, so there was five on the client side.

The project manager on it, who also quit, was great. I loved working with her. That was a lot of agency involvement. That was the complete opposite. We were getting stuff printed upstairs, we were using the recording studios for me to do voiceovers. We were, all the account people, planners, everybody would be in the meetings, we would talk about, blah blah blah, that was a big ordeal. Everyone was involved. We got called in, New York got called in to help Detroit, so it was a big deal. It was a big agency.",

    "text": "It was all internal. It was a pitch, so it was us against other agencies, but we nailed it. We nailed the strategy, and then they wanted us to come back with anthem spots, you know. Because, see the weirdest thing, the meeting before, they just wanted the strategy and they wanted product spots, so we had to do one for the Ford Focus and one for Sync and one for this and that, and we gave them spots and they loved it. They said it got a standing ovation or something like that, they loved it. He said it was one of the best presentations he'd ever had. It went from, so then they wanted anthem spots to go with it. Anthems are like, it tells what this brand is about type of thing. Ford is about going green now, whatever, and so okay, we gave them that, and we did it in a totally different way. I thought it was fresh, cool, and awesome, and I would love to have it in my book. It went from us being great, he said it was similar to a dead man walking. People at JWT Detroit found out about what was happening or something like that, and this dude that always presents with them called them the day before and was like, I'm not going to present with you. He said he walked in, it was like in the jungle. There's the circle of monkeys and the big monkeys fighting and they're all, ah, ah, and all of the sudden they all go quiet, and all of a sudden the big monster or whatever comes out, the big snake or something, and that's what it was. They were all the client monkeys waiting for him to be pounced on. Creatively, everything went great, and it couldn't have been better except for the ending. Oh my gosh, death by committee. A lot, more than I know. I didn't deal with them. There's always one guy that controls it all, in any dynamic there's always one person, leader, guy or girl, I'm sorry. Yeah, there was definitely a committee, because that's like, CCO, you wouldn't present it to the board or whatever. I just had to present it to my CDs.  I think the idea was, because we had this, we kept changing the brief, which is another issue. You know, no, it was USA. It was USA. I know, it's ridiculous. You know, American, bigger is better. I think they dumbed down one thing about America. I think they underestimated, me being from Nebraska, I don't really think, especially I think there's a chip on the shoulder of people on the coast that the Midwest are a bunch of freaking idiots, you know what I mean? Not well, if they did have risk tolerance, they would have ran our stuff. Our stuff was, like something new that has never been done. It's not just, that's redundant. What they ended up going with was basically the same as any car, American car ad that they've been doing. Not well, if they did have risk tolerance, they would have ran our stuff. Our stuff was, like something new that has never been done. It's not just, that's redundant. What they ended up going with was basically the same as any car, American car ad that they've been doing. You see this with clients a lot. They say they want something new, but they don't really want something new, you know what I mean? They want to feel, I think they really want to think they do, but they don't. They want to stay in their comfort zone. I understand why, because it's a lot of money, you know, and it's hard for people who think in spreadsheets, this is a number, and I need this number to equal this number. It's like how accounting is, you take an accounting class and everything comes back to a perfect little package, you know how it works, and then you ask them to go out, and how do you measure something that emotional, that's an emotional connection or that's just feeling. There's no chart. They try to do it with testing, but I don't think testing works. That's how they tried to meeting in the middle, but it doesn't work, because there's no way to quantify moving somebody or making somebody entertained. Do you find that entertaining, have you ever looked into what testing is like?  They say they want something new, but they don't really want something new, you know what I mean? They want to feel, I think they really want to think they do, but they don't. They want to stay in their comfort zone.

That's how they tried to meeting in the middle, but it doesn't work, because there's no way to quantify moving somebody or making somebody entertained. Do you find that entertaining, have you ever looked into what testing is like? That was the, because they hated it, right, the board hated it, but they said they were going to put it into testing. They put it all into testing to see, if it killed in testing, we would get past them. It would have to do stupendous. They put a whole bunch of limits on us. They wanted to change some stuff and they were like no, it goes as is. It was obvious they wanted it to die. I think it's really bad testing. I think it's a bad thing. You should look up on YouTube, are you familiar with the Apple 1984 commercial? It's like famous, right? Boston agency Arnold for their holiday party went and tested the 1984, they put it up on boards and they got an actual, the people to come into the room, I can't think of what they're called right now. They just showed the boards and they showed a storyboard of the 1984, which is one of the best of all times, and the people reacted horribly. People reacted horribly, they're like, I don't know why. Maybe they should put an Apple logo on the shirt so they know that it's Apple or something. It was just horrible. I just don't think that testing and creativity work well together. I probably could grab it for you. It was revitalize Ford, everyone things American car, they think American car company, you think dated, behind, but Ford is doing things with their, they have a couple, they have the greenest car plant in the world, and they have this car plant in Italy that's powered by wind. They wanted to push all these things and show that they're a forward thinking company. They basically wanted us to change the perspective of American automobiles. There's A, B, C, and D points that we can push that help that, that sink technology, biodiesel, whatever, a hydrogen car in the near future. Yeah, we had to emphasize that Ford is changing, that there's a new Ford, that Ford's thinking about the future, to change perspective of how, I'm sure, I don't know how you think, but I know how most people think about American car companies, so that was the idea. Which is why it needed something completely different and not the same stuff. I'm a little bitter. I'm a little bitter. Between us, it was great. We nailed it. I mean anthem spots like 1984 that says what this company's, we're turning around. They were good spots, but they were familiar, and then they all got killed or put aside, which basically it got killed, which happens a lot. That's one thing you have to be able to just take is people saying no, your idea's bad and just push it off. Anyway, Lisa's like, let's just have some fun and write some song. I went and started a song, and Josh started writing a song, and then we looked at, okay, we like this one, let's push that, all right, then let's get A, B, C, and D that I was talking about before in there, in a fun way. That was the inspiration, it's like, fuck this, let's have fun. Tight. It was a while back, I'm trying to think. I didn't sleep much, I don't know. We had a week to get it all produced. Oh yeah, though the ECD at the time, who has since been released, we didn't get along at all, none of us got along at all. Yeah, he was an ECD. He was who we had to answer to. Executive creative director is what he was. As a team of four, we go present to him and Tai. He was a terrible, and in fact, yeah, most people in here did not like him. No, I mean, you only show it to people around. You get input when you present it to ECDs and stuff like that. There was an account person in there, I like this and that. You know, so you always try to get opinions, because otherwise you get locked into something, you can miss a gaping hole in the concept. I don't know. I just know that we got pulled onto it, and it was ongoing for a while. Us and others, but so we just went in and did some totally fun stuff, you know, we made songs. We actually recorded them, just about, just goofy stuff, not Adam Sandler-esque, these songs, but just weird stuff about MPGs and all that, and then we called in, my CD called in some favors at sound houses, and we got music. We recorded it. This was all for the presentation and it was really good. We went and we called some animation houses and they made some comps for us, and everything looked really good. I even sang, I sang one of the songs, and it was a country one. They say they want something new, but they don't really want something new, you know what I mean? They want to feel, I think they really want to think they do, but they don't. Not well, if they did have risk tolerance, they would have ran our stuff. Our stuff was, like something new that has never been done. hat was the, because they hated it, right, the board hated it, but they said they were going to put it into testing. They put a whole bunch of limits on us. They wanted to change some stuff and they were like no, it goes as is. It was briefed three times, they kept changing the brief. The client kept changing their mind. What they wanted to do with the brief? It works. We make it work. It's nice to have two different perspectives. Between us and between our CDs, it was like a team of four. We just sat down, we wrote the songs, recorded them. Everything just meshed, worked well. Our, what was our source of inspiration. Okay, sorry. Well, we came out of this meeting, we wrote a bunch of anthems, they're just like any other anthem. We came out of the meeting and our CD, Lisa, she just goes, you know what, let's just make songs. Let's just have some fun. He was a terrible, and in fact, yeah, most people in here did not like him. I don't know. I just know that we got pulled onto it, and it was ongoing for a while. Us and others, but so we just went in and did some totally fun stuff, you know, we made songs. We actually recorded them, just about, just goofy stuff, It was beautiful. Tai, you know the head guy here, he loved it, everyone here loved it, and we took it to the client and Tai said it was the worst presentation experience he ever had in his whole life. They didn't want it. They didn't want good stuff. You can see what they're doing now, it's not good. Up until that point, it was all hurrahs, patting each other on the back. It went from us being great, he said it was similar to a dead man walking. People at JWT Detroit found out about what was happening or something like that, and this dude that always presents with them called them the day before and was like, I'm not going to present with you.

    "text": "Okay. So our very first project we worked on was for Smirnoff. Smirnoff cocktails. And it was a brief that had been swimming around for something like three months before we got there, and then the client had declined several ideas and finally got to us. We had an idea that we were happy, it checked off all their boxes, and then slowly, over about four months, just became diluted. Very diluted, and got squeezed until it was nothing. It was because of the ineptitude of the client, and just them pushing and on their side, way too many layers to go through. There was about six, five layers ... Probably five layers, all with the ability to kill and put their two cents in, but none with the ability to say `Yes, do this.` So it was just an arduous process, going back and forth, which just pretty much drained any creativity out of it whatsoever. Too many to count. Upwards of 30 plus. Zero. Social aspect of it, the ease of use, the great taste. It's introducing new, make sure they know it's new. Make sure the beautiful bottle is highlighted. Did I already say the aspect of occasions? It's enjoyed in social settings. That's what I can remember off the top of my head Timing, actually, initially no. But again, when it came to revisions, the client would come back and things would have to be changed in a very short amount of time. Budget was not an issue. I mean, it didn't cause any angst between us two. I guess, if anything, we would just bitch to each other. We had, luckily, one of the best account guys worked with, who's no longer here, who was just as frustrated as we were, if not more so. Because he had to deal with the client every day. And at some point, the client went above his head and that just turned into a mess for him, for us. So with our specific account guy who was initially on the project, it was kind of like he was always the bearer of bad news. If anyone had to deliver it, he was the best to do it. But once it went over his head, it was just a nightmare. We had an idea that we were happy, it checked off all their boxes, and then slowly, over about four months, just became diluted.

I remember it was trying to say about seven things. Seven different messages. Too many messages all jammed into this one little brief, one print ad. Yeah, frighteningly obvious. But just, we ended up with a concept about ... It was so easy, the drink is perfect, you need to only master your pour. It was kind of ... What's it called? Bartenders flash, you know when they flip the bottle around and catch it and pour a drink. I guess it'd be the same two or three, but it would always be different ones and they'd have different opinions. Some were okay, some ... no one could make ... It was horrible.   But once it went over his head, it was just a nightmare. And at some point, the client went above his head and that just turned into a mess for him, for us.

    "text": "Okay, so as part of the sponsorship to get the word out and how Simpsons have taken over JetBlue, I wrote from the perspective of Mr. Burns. I took over his blog, the JetBlue CEO, from the perspective of Mr. Burns, and Mr. Burns trashed David Neeleman, basically telling him all the things he could have done wrong. And of course, by trashing him, is actually giving him a compliment, because he's saying David Neeleman is too humane in a nutshell, and treats passengers too well. Whereas as a CEO needs to destroy them. So that worked out well, because it was a voice I know well, and I was able to emulate. I think it was pretty cool. It got good coverage on different advertising blogs, even TMZ. So that was somewhat of a success. There was no budget, because there was no need for a budget. It was all on JetBlue-owned website. So it was free media. Time constraints were ... Maybe I had a month to do this. The initial rounds, no. But then, of course, when there's comments and you need them less than a day later, then it becomes tight. I mean, it was a small project, a very small project, but all the ingredients were right to make it really enjoyable.   More or less just willing to work ... Not really dictating to me, willing to work with me, just kind of ... I guess it was a very odd situation, just because just being a fan, we had more Simpsons knowledge than anyone else who's kind of defaulted to our judgment. In more cases than we would in any other situation. There were several ... It was kind of two levels once there were several ideas presented for the JetBlue sponsorship of the Simpsons movie. And what was presented was probably about 25. It got narrowed down to a few, very diluted, and this was one of the only last remaining living ones. Then once on this project, I had to write probably 20 or so different entries, which got narrowed down to about four. Four specific, I guess, executions of this idea. I took over his blog, the JetBlue CEO, from the perspective of Mr. Burns, and Mr. Burns trashed David Neeleman, basically telling him all the things he could have done wrong.",

    "text": "I remember it was a brief for Halls Cough drops. It was a TV brief. Our original brief was we want something cool and edgy and we want to speak to young people and hip people and eventually, the brief just kept getting changed and getting changed and the client was soo indecisive and didn't know what they wanted. I think we wrote almost 200 scripts at some point and after a few months, by the end of it we were just burned on it and it was like, okay the client needs to figure out what they really want because in the beginning we were told, hip, cool, fun, exciting work and that's what we presented and now they're saying we want the same ads we had in the '50s. The client told us one thing, our brief was one thing in the beginning and then it completely changed and that's not what they wanted or they got scared or whatever. We went through 200 scripts and one of our ideas still lived and we had to make an animatic, I don't know if you know what that is, it's horrible. No. And they use it for testing purposes, to test the idea. Which I think is not always the best way to find out if people like something or whether it's going to work. So we had to make an animatic for this Hall's thing and it was just ... making the animatic was hell and the fact that we were already burned out on it and we've been through 200 ideas and then making the animatic we were struggling to get what the client wanted in our idea and every time we would change something they'd as for one more thing to be fit into our idea, which we didn't have time for. The finished animatic ended up not being too much like what our original idea was. We were upset about that and then it didn't test well and then it died. The finished animatic ended up not being too much like what our original idea was. We were upset about that and then it didn't test well and then it died. We went through a lot of different stuff. We had roadblocks with one of our creative directors at a certain point were we would sit in his office and we felt like he didn't get our sense of humor and then he would suggest something. He's like, how about this, this is funny. And it would be something that we didn't think it was funny at all. We kind of clashed a little bit with him. . I don't think that was the main problem, I think the problem was that the client just kept changing their minds about what they wanted. Every time we would go to present to them, they would be like, that's great and then they'd think about it and then they'd be like, we need to communicate this. I found that the best briefs are the ones that stay the same. Once you get that brief, the brief doesn't change. I don't think that was the main problem, I think the problem was that the client just kept changing their minds about what they wanted. Every time we would go to present to them, they would be like, that's great and then they'd think about it and then they'd be like, we need to communicate this. I found that the best briefs are the ones that stay the same. Once you get that brief, the brief doesn't change. Like with Boost. Our brief stayed the same the entire time. The client never decided, oh we want to see this instead. Its really hard at that point to try ... sometimes you have to go back to square one and then sometimes you don't and it just sort of mucks things up. Yeah there was, on the client side, especially there were a group of three or four people and they would talk amongst themselves and it felt like there were a lot of levels on that project to go through. Yeah. I think that was part of their problem on why the brief kept changing because we'd hear one thing from one client and then one of their cronies would say oh, but we want to talk about this, we can't forget about this. They took no risks. Yeah, and it was for this product called Halls Bursts which are like these little tiny candy-like things that come in a tic tac box sort of thing and so they're just supposed to be for if you have a little scratchy throat or a little sore throat. Not a full on cough drop, a little bit less than that. The target was everyone in the end and they wanted to say that it soothes scratchy throats and it wasn't for people who had a full blown cough. They just wanted to get very specific with it and really didn't want to do too much branding. I think the budget was kind of small because they only wanted to do one TV spot. I don't really remember, this was a while ago. I know what we kept going through round, after round, after round so I'm sure that somebody's calendars had to change at some point. We were writing soo many scripts. We would write 20 in a day or whatever, we would write a lot of them and it consumed our lives. At first it was fun. We always try to write scripts that ... well in the beginning, we really tried to write scripts that we thought was funny, that we liked and we had fun writing and stuff that we thought would entertain us. There's still some of those scripts now, I think back on them and I think they could be funny for another product or something. Or there could be a funny idea in it somewhere. I think by the end, we were soo burned out and frustrated with the whole process and we felt like our idea, the one that went into testing, that that one, that script changed considerably from where we had originally written it that there were just soo many product features and things about the product that were trying to be injected into this idea that just didn't fit in there. It was a guru type of guy sitting on a mountain and we were inspired by Tim Robbins character in High Fidelity. He plays this guy, Ian, and he's spiritual and kind of wacky and weird, he doesn't really know what's going on. He claims to but he doesn't. He was the inspiration for one of our characters. The other character was, we had a guy dressed up as a Halls Burst in a costume that made him look like this candy, cough drop thing and as far as where that idea came from, I have no idea. No, just phone. A few times in person. It was kind of weird. They would say something different to us in person than they would say later after they'd talked about our ideas. They weren't that great. I heard that now there's a different client there. I've heard that it's better now. Above us was the creative director and above him were the executive creative directors, so it was the one executive creative director that we kind of clashed with a little bit. The one creative director, he was pretty much on our side the whole time and he was like okay, here's how we can try to make this work and he was trying to work with us trying to get an idea sold and trying to get something through. I think internally, it was okay. There weren't too many issues. It was more with the client and the fact that they kept changing their minds. I remember it was a brief for Halls Cough drops. It was a TV brief. Our original brief was we want something cool and edgy and we want to speak to young people and hip people and eventually, the brief just kept getting changed and getting changed and the client was soo indecisive and didn't know what they wanted. So we had to make an animatic for this Hall's thing and it was just ... making the animatic was hell and the fact that we were already burned out on it and we've been through 200 ideas and then making the animatic we were struggling to get what the client wanted in our idea and every time we would change something they'd as for one more thing to be fit into our idea, which we didn't have time for. He's like, how about this, this is funny. And it would be something that we didn't think it was funny at all. We kind of clashed a little bit with him. I think the problem was that the client just kept changing their minds about what they wanted. Every time we would go to present to them, they would be like, that's great and then they'd think about it and then they'd be like, we need to communicate this. I found that the best briefs are the ones that stay the same. Once you get that brief, the brief doesn't change. Yeah. Which I didn't understand that they said that they wanted it to be targeted towards young people and then they changed their minds later. It would seem like they would've had research that young people are the kind of people they wanted to target ut after they changed the brief, they decided to just go with a broad target.  have no idea. I think at the end it was probably like, we are speaking to everyone in the world ... It was. We laughed at it at one point. It was just like, look how many scripts we've written, this is crazy. It's insane. We were like, okay we will keep coming up with ideas, we'll keep doing this and we did. We did what we had to do. We just kept coming up with more and more ideas. I think by the end, we were soo burned out and frustrated with the whole process and we felt like our idea, the one that went into testing, that that one, that script changed considerably from where we had originally written it that there were just soo many product features and things about the product that were trying to be injected into this idea that just didn't fit in there.

    "text": "It just felt really rewarding and good to be working on something like that and the way that we collaborated, Margie and I were the lead team on it and then there was another team that would help us out whenever we needed help. We collaborated with them a lot in the beginning phases of the project. Boost up. Margie might talk about it also. We started working on that, we were briefed in June and it just finished in December. Because it was pro bono, it was really rewarding. It wasn't like we're trying to sell something to somebody, we're actually trying to keep kids in school and help kids graduate. The whole concept of Boost Up is, the reason why a lot of these kids don't graduate is because they don't have enough support from their friends or their family or from teachers. If they just had someone giving a little encouragement, a little boost just saying, you can do it, you should graduate, that's all it takes is just a little bit of encouragement, a little bit of a boost to help these kids graduate. It just felt really rewarding and good to be working on something like that and the way that we collaborated, Margie and I were the lead team on it and then there was another team that would help us out whenever we needed help. We collaborated with them a lot in the beginning phases of the project. My partner and I were working on every single aspect of it so it was pretty huge. What happened to the project, it ended up being a lucky thing, we had a creative director on the project and as we were shooting the TV spots, he announced that he was leaving the company and going to another job. He left and another guy took over and then a week or two later that guy was like, I'm leaving and he went to another job. A lot of it was just me and Margie and this other team. We need to make these decisions and let's make them and getting things done. We had a great producer and he was organizing everything and making sure everything was happening on time and on task. There was a core group of us so we are making the decisions and things had to go through this or that person at some level and we had to get approval from Ad Council for everything. As far as internally, it was a really small group of us, which was good. We found that because we cared about this project soo much we didn't want too many hands to touch it. It was like well if we don't tell too many people that we are working on this, we just lay low and keep working on it then we will protect the integrity of the idea. Sometimes it makes more sense to have more hands in the pie but for this project we need to make sure we keep this amongst these people. So it worked out. They had to take a big risk, actually. The Ad Council and the Army as well because last year's campaign they spent a lot of money on TV spots and not very much money on the web so this year we wanted them to spend 80% of the budget on the web and 20% on the TV stuff. Which is a risk for any client to take. The Ad Council, when we were presenting to them, they were like this is groundbreaking for us, we've never done anything like this before. It was huge website so it was a big step for them. I think it was the biggest website project that they've ever been involved in. It was a big deal for for them to take a risk on them. In the beginning the brief was really simple. It was, here's last year's campaign, what can we do with it this year. What they have done in the past was they picked ten kids, ten seniors from around the country and had them document their senior year on video and we sent them a video camera and they'd send us back the videos and then they'd post them online. That was the place that last years campaign ended up. The website was cool. You could watch these kids videos but you couldn't do anything else to interact with them or encourage them or give them a boost. We were like okay this is cool you have these videos but we want to be able to create a website that wasn't as static. Wasn't just sitting there watching videos. Where you could actually interact with the kids and go on their MySpace page or interact with them on Facebook or send them a text message. The budget was small. Since it was pro bono and there wasn't too much of a budget, the web company worked ... we did pay them but they worked at a reduced rate, I think. It was directed and edited by the same people who did it last year. I think we may have paid them something but I'm sure it was probably reduced or something. As far as media, there was absolutely no media budget whatsoever. All the media for the TV spots and for the print was all donated No, it was actually good that we could ... with other clients when they have media bought already, you have to deal with that time frame. It's like it's due now, it's due now. We could bend to that and be flexible and make sure that we had enough time to get the media right instead of just trying to get it out of the door. In this case it really helped us to be able to bend it a little bit. The radio had to be out by a certain time and we got that done on time and the TV as well. I think all the deadlines were pushed a little bit but the web deadline, we extended a lot more than we planned. A lot of it had to do with, lets talk to kids where they already are in ways that they already use. So let's use MySpace, let's use Facebook, lets use texting, lets go on YouTube and so the Boost website sort of works as a hub for all of those other sites. We did pick ten kids again this year and they are posting their videos online but in addition to watching their stories, you can go on their individual pages and leave comments for them or send them an email and it all gets filtered back into the site. So you can see how many emails they've gotten, how many MySpace messages they've gotten, if there's been any video comments on YouTube, how many text messages people have sent them and it's all recorded, visually on the site so you can see who's made a comment where and it's a timeline as well. So you can see how much support this kid has gotten from day one up till now and up to graduation. Yeah, they were building it. Our concept for the website and how it was going to work and all of that stuff was from us. They were cool. We were on the shoot with one main client and she was really nice and helpful. After we would leave meetings at their offices we would come out of it and say, wow, I wish all of our clients were that great and all of our clients were that cool and willing to take risks and that easy. Usually if they brought up any points of contention when we were presenting to them, they were completely valid points and we would agree with them. Yeah, they were very helpful and a lot of their feedback was take it or leave it but here's how we feel about this. We could argue against it or for it and it was very much working together in compromise with them, they were great. A lot of the time it was the four of us sitting in a room talking about it and thinking about what we could do and just spending time on it. I think it helps that we all really cared about it. We were more personally invested in it than if we were making an ad for toilet paper or chips or something. We really wanted to do something and help. Yes, nationally it's running right now actually. The website was the biggest part of it. Since we were talking to teenagers mostly, we wanted to make sure that we were online and that we were in places that they were already communicating with each other. Our website connects to MySpace and Facebook and YouTube and those sites that they're already on. I was a really big process. We worked with another company in San Francisco and they were building the website and we were creative directing them to get it all done. That was months of phone calls and work and all that stuff. We found that because we cared about this project soo much we didn't want too many hands to touch it. It was like well if we don't tell too many people that we are working on this, we just lay low and keep working on it then we will protect the integrity of the idea. We were like okay this is cool you have these videos but we want to be able to create a website that wasn't as static. Wasn't just sitting there watching videos. Where you could actually interact with the kids and go on their MySpace page or interact with them on Facebook or send them a text message. We started in June and the website was supposed to launch in September, October to coincide with the beginning of the school year for the kids, but we had to push the website back because we wanted to make sure that, since it was such a huge part, an incredible piece of the project, we wanted to make sure it was right and done well and done the way we wanted it to be done. The website didn't really ... it was technically launched in October but it's grown a lot in the last few months and come into its own in the last couple of months. It really was a six month project. I think all the deadlines were pushed a little bit but the web deadline, we extended a lot more than we planned. t was good. During the entire project we were amazed at how smoothly it was going and how much we liked working on it and how much we liked working with the other team. We all cared about it and we all had a heart for it. We were hoping that it would turn out to be something really cool that we had envisioned that it had. We are all pretty happy about it now.

As far as my relationship with the account people, our account guy was also great and really on top of stuff. He was the main contact for the client. We really just had contact with the client when we went to their office to present to them or speak to them. He had daily contact with them at certain points and he was great and did a good job and we like him.",

    "text": "It started off with, well first off for some reason there are two ECDs, executive creative directors, working on that account and then on the web site, because we have a web department where there are more CDs, and then us and the account people and there were too many cooks in the kitchen. So we had these ideas that it was horrible, because you would present it to one ECD who would approve it and then the other one would kill the idea, and then we would work on it and the account people would say that, and then the account people also had the same problem. They would like, couldn't get everyone in the room so they, some account people could kind of like approve something but then when we would show it to the other boss, he would kill the idea or what not. So it was chaos. So really, everything was great and then the producers saying we don't have time, then we sat in a room. One of the ECDs was saying something, the web people were saying other things, and we ended up killing the idea of shooting a woman because we don't have time, we don't have money, we don't have this or that. And then we end up being like click here and it says like when she says this it means this. And it's basically what it came down to. So I basically, I was so disappointed I kind of got asked to pull out of the project as I got put on something different. But I know if I had a passion for this I would have said to the new assignment like look, I can't, I'm working on this. But I was like yes. I want something new because this is not. Not that I wanted to run away from it but it was really annoying, so. No one had time to do research. Barely had time to approve it on time. No, I was just gonna say, obviously mention the whole line they have. The journey one, which is the stones go from the smallest to the biggest and the three stone ring that represents the past, present and future. They have their different lines that you have to mention. Budget wasn't that much, but within the, what we wanted to do was feasible within the budget. Definitely a huge problem. If we had time, we would have solved the internal issues. Because it wasn't even the client, it was internally we screwed ourselves up. o we had these ideas that it was horrible, because you would present it to one ECD who would approve it and then the other one would kill the idea, and then we would work on it and the account people would say that, and then the account people also had the same problem. there were too many cooks in the kitchen.

So I basically, I was so disappointed I kind of got asked to pull out of the project as I got put on something different. Because of their hierarchy within their department, they can't get everyone in the same room, so the same problem we were having here of, you need too many approvals to like have a final say of you're good to go. They would like, couldn't get everyone in the room so they, some account people could kind of like approve something but then when we would show it to the other boss, he would kill the idea or what not.

    "text": "Yeah. And we were working on so many different disciplines, the planners, the strategics people, the logistics people and it was really like no one slept for months. It was crazy but you didn't mind at all because you knew the outcome of the event was gonna be so big. It was this game in different cities in like Portland. And it was just crazy but good crazy because no matter the long hours or what not, you had so much passion working for it because you knew it was good. There was something really good. It was a lifetime opportunity to do something great, so I would say that was the most, just because you started something from the very beginning and saw it all the way to the end result, and it was thrilling to work on that. And it was just crazy but good crazy because no matter the long hours or what not, you had so much passion working for it because you knew it was good. There was something really good. It was a lifetime opportunity to do something great, so I would say that was the most, just because you started something from the very beginning and saw it all the way to the end result, and it was thrilling to work on that A lot, but the good thing is that we had like one lead had the last call and everything. That was good because you could have many people thinking different things, but at the end he would make the final call. It was pretty risky because nothing, not many companies had done anything like that, so he couldn't quite, it's hard to measure the results and the outcome of it. It could really flop or be a success. So I think they took a risk by doing this. They were just trying to target teenagers, like make it cool for teenagers. No, because this was pretty cheap. Although it was complicated, at the end of the day we just needed to, Quest needed to provide us with cell phones for the kids that they would return back that same day. The inflatable animals weren't expensive. Couple of city permits to lock down some streets and our hotel data base room for thing. No, it was pretty cheap. Well, ups and downs between us and the account people and different disciplines, like you would laugh, yell, cry, everything. We were just beat and tired. The source of inspiration. Well, it was really a team effort. I think that was the only idea. Usually just walk in with one big idea and you feel so strong about it that take it or leave it. Sometimes you play it safe and you show the edgy idea and then the safe idea. Sometimes you just go with one and it's really a team decision between the creatives and the accountant. And I guess the more you know your client the easier it gets eventually to read them and anticipate how they're gonna react, etc.   Like supporting what the creatives wanted to do, question for ideas, getting things done on time. Well, they'd won awards, so. The whole game thing and it was with cell phones. There were these codes in the streets and as you take a picture of the code and send it to our base and they would get points. It was really complicated but exciting game for them to play, so I don't know if they could even research that beforehand.",

    "text": "We came up with some really great ideas. I was working with a different partner on this one. We came up with some really great ideas. And again, I'm a tennis player, so I was really passionate about it. The TV spots were all great. We had three individual campaigns. One was about anticipation and how he anticipates better than anyone, that's why he sort of looks like he moves effortly across the court. And the other two ideas were really great as well. And so I would've been happy to have made any of them. And so we went through rounds and rounds of creative and it was big ruling. And I guess the ideas weren't coming together. I think I had one vision as an art director and I think the writer wasn't in line with my vision. And I think everyone else was. So I think we had a bit of trouble going back and forth with the writer on that one. At least I did, personally.  And Rolex is definitely not an easy brand. They're very conservative, very set in their ways. They don't want to do anything that's outside of their box, which is a very small box. And then, we had managed to jump over all these hurdles and I was really thrilled about it. And Rolex is definitely not an easy brand. They're very conservative, very set in their ways. They don't want to do anything that's outside of their box, which is a very small box. And then, we had managed to jump over all these hurdles and I was really thrilled about it. So that was a bit difficult. But then we finally got it together. And everyone, internally, loved the work. The account team and the ECD's and senior creatives loved the work. Showed it to the client. They loved the work. Showed it to a few other clients around the world, sort of in stages, different meetings. And Rolex is definitely not an easy brand. They're very conservative, very set in their ways. They don't want to do anything that's outside of their box, which is a very small box. And then, we had managed to jump over all these hurdles and I was really thrilled about it. And about a month ago, we had a shoot with Federer. And, of course, it's Roger Federer, so he has the final say on the work. And I was really excited. They were gonna present the work at the shoot. And I was up all night. I was ready. I was like, `Oh, it's getting presented. Wouldn't it be great if we could shoot it?` I was really excited. And then it all kind of flopped. And they never presented the work to him, and it all just kind of - Well, the account team never presented the work. I don't know. I think it had ... They said time constraints, but there's been a lot of going back and forth as to why it didn't get presented. So it was a little bit frustrating to hear that we had gone through all of this process and then they didn't even really give it the chance to work. Well, they were at the shoot and that's when they were gonna present the work. And I'm not blaming them. I wasn't there. I don't know what happened. But the last word that I heard was that the client didn't want to present the work at that time because he wanted to do new work and have it more finished. Except this is the work that he had already approved himself previously, and had been through meetings with. So it was kind of like, `What? I don't understand.` Yeah, it was a lot of work. It was a lot of effort. And it just sort of went nowhere. The senior client and the senior account guy here. I think they had a conversation and that's sort of where, that's where it came from. The risk for Rolex on this? Well, I think in our minds it wasn't that big of a deal. You present the work, if he likes it or he doesn't. But I think in their minds, Roger Federer is their golden child. So they're very cautious of how they use their time with him and how he feels treated, and how all that sort of pans out. They're extremely walking on a very thin rope. Only certain people are allowed to talk to him. Only certain people are allowed to be in the room and say anything to him. So I think, with this particular one, they were probably ... I mean, the client's extremely conservative to begin with. But I think this was even more so than the usual just every day work that they do, because he is their main guy. So, in no way, shape or form would they ever want to stir the water there. And I think at one point he had left Rolex and that upset them very much. And then he came back. So now he's back and they'll basically do anything he asks them to do. They had set a budget, but it's basically, if Roger likes the idea, then we'll make the idea. Were actually really tight. Because there's only a very small window of time that he allows people to even be in his life. I get he's a professional athlete. He's very disciplined, very strict training regimen. And, as a tennis player you play year-round. There's no definite season. There's the Grand Slam series, which sort of ... I would say, January through the end of the summer, you're not gonna get any of his time. So you kind of have like a four or five month window - Where you schedule everything. And we had the shoot scheduled. But, we were finalizing these ideas in, probably, June. So that's already cutting it close anyway. So it looks like we'd have to present it, and then start shooting immediately. And then editing. And then have it all ready to roll out during the tournaments this year. So it was pretty tight. I mean, it was a matter of six months. Yeah. Which also could have contributed to not presenting it. Because I think one of the ideas we'd talked about it, it was a bit complicated. So for us to actually shoot it and execute it in a right way, we would've needed two days of his time, which was more ... He'll give you an hour and a half. If you're lucky. And that's when he's not busy. So we would've needed about two days. So that's something we would've presented now and then shot in September. Not shoot it yet. It was to present the idea, to see if he was on board with it, to see which one of the three he wanted to shoot. And then they didn't even show any of it to him. And maybe they were being nice. Maybe they were being nice to me. I don't know. Who knows what happened? We're both stumbling. Being a bit difficult just because I was so close to the work and I had a lot of heart for it. And I really wanted it to be something great. And it just wasn't quite coming together. And there was a couple of ideas that I really loved, and they were more art directional, and so I didn't want to see them die because the writing wasn't working out. And we were sort of in an interim little period there for awhile where there was no senior writer on the project. So he was just a junior writer. And I'm just a junior art director. But there was no senior guidance writing wise, and so we had a freelancer come in who was just sort of a total flop. And then he was gone after a week. And then we had another guy came in who was much better, who is not still here as one of the creative directors, and he's a senior writer. And then things sort of came together, except we were up against such a tight window, to go through all that in the middle of it just made things a bit more stressful. As usual. Rolex sort of is what it is. It's very ultra-conservative. Well, we kind of understand each other, but I think it got to the point where the writing just wasn't coming together, and so the idea wasn't coming together. So I think everyone was feeling a bit tense and a bit frustrated just as a whole group. It's not like anyone was really pointing the finger or blaming, it was just sort of how it happened. But yeah, I think there was a few very frustrated conversations between myself and some of the account people, and the older creatives and the account people. And between all of us. I think it was just a bit of frustrating project. There was times where I was really frustrated with the ECD just because ... I think I always had a really clear vision of what it was, and then the vision kept changing and people kept changing it. And in the end, nobody really knew what the idea was. The idea was changing internally. Well, and the brief was sort of a moving target. Now that I think about it, they had the initial brief and it wasn't very specific, it was kind of broad. And then we present work and they'd be like, `Well you have to do this.` And we'd be like, `Well, you know, you didn't say that anywhere.` And then we're like, `Okay, we'll do this.` And then it's like how many ideas can we cram into this? And so it was a bit of a moving target, but in the end, we were like, `Okay, this, this, this. That's it. No more.` And then once it started to sit still a little bit, we still had a bit of trouble getting the idea to sort of work as a good idea. And so it was all just a bit frustrating, a bit tedious, and everyone was a bit burned out at the end of it. But the work was good in the end. The result was good. Everyone was happy with it. The print was really nice. It would've been nice to make. And then I think that was the icing on the cake, that everyone had been through all of that agony to try and pull it together, and then it didn't even see the light of day. But the work was good in the end. The result was good. Everyone was happy with it. The print was really nice. It would've been nice to make. And then I think that was the icing on the cake, that everyone had been through all of that agony to try and pull it together, and then it didn't even see the light of day. You spend months and months and then it just, at the last minute, gets the ax. e respected me as an art director. I respected him as a writer. So how do we tell this in a way that allows the story to be the story? So why don't we use really beautiful, old historic photography that's true to the era, true to the location, the times? We did this incredibly extensive ... I, personally, in the art buying department, did this incredibly extensive process of researching photography from pre-and post-revolutionary Russia, from all the different countries that he moved from, at the dates, at the times, found all these photographs that were really powerful. A Because we want to do some Federer TV, which is something that we don't do.` And so I was thrilled about it. And I guess the ideas weren't coming together. I think I had one vision as an art director and I think the writer wasn't in line with my vision. And I think everyone else was. So I think we had a bit of trouble going back and forth with the writer on that one. At least I did, personally. They're very conservative, very set in their ways. They don't want to do anything that's outside of their box, which is a very small box. And then, we had managed to jump over all these hurdles and I was really thrilled about it. They said time constraints, but there's been a lot of going back and forth as to why it didn't get presented. So it was a little bit frustrating to hear that we had gone through all of this process and then they didn't even really give it the chance to work. So I think if it was a clear no, like, `We don't like the work. We're not presenting it,` then I can take that. I can stomach that. But just the sort of lack of answer and explanation was probably the most frustrating and hardest thing to stomach. I mean, the client's extremely conservative to begin with. But I think this was even more so than the usual just every day work that they do, because he is their main guy. So, in no way, shape or form would they ever want to stir the water there. And I think at one point he had left Rolex and that upset them very much. And then he came back. So now he's back and they'll basically do anything he asks them to do. Not that, we didn't get a chance to do it. It was good. We came up with some good ideas together. I got a bit frustrated at the end. And I think he could sort of read that, just because the ... He's not a tennis player. I don't really know if he's done very much athletics in his life. I think he has other interests, which is perfectly fine. But I just think the language that was being used and the way we were talking about things just wasn't what it should have been. And maybe I was just being particularly difficult. And then we had another guy came in who was much better, who is not still here as one of the creative directors, and he's a senior writer. And then things sort of came together, except we were up against such a tight window, to go through all that in the middle of it just made things a bit more stressful. But there was never any ill will. It was just sort of a bit of frustration. It could've gone either way. I'm sure he was frustrated with me, too. It's not a big deal. But there was a bit of tension.   I think the inspiration came from my own personal experience as tennis player, and playing on the pro tour, and knowing what it's like to be out there on the court and knowing the sort of the things that you go through and the things that are going through your head. And the things that really frustrate you when you play against someone who's just really damn good. Just thinking you've hit an unbelievable shot, an unbelievable back hand, and then having it come back better. It just kind of gets to you a little bit. And there's just nothing you can do. So I think that's where a lot of it came from. Just my own ... It's not like anyone was really pointing the finger or blaming, it was just sort of how it happened. But yeah, I think there was a few very frustrated conversations between myself and some of the account people, and the older creatives and the account people. And between all of us. I think it was just a bit of frustrating project. Well, we kind of understand each other, but I think it got to the point where the writing just wasn't coming together, and so the idea wasn't coming together. So I think everyone was feeling a bit tense and a bit frustrated just as a whole group.",

    "text": "And this was the first two or three weeks I was here. I had sort of worked on a few projects and the ECD who'd actually brought me into the agency was doing his best to help me out and get me started and get some work made. And I didn't have a partner. I was just sort of floating, working on little random projects here and there, and was a bit of a ... I was just sort of random. Nobody really knew what to do with me, because I came straight off the tennis court into the office, so nobody really knew what to do. And so we just threw some ideas together and the client ended up sort of liking two of them. And than that meant that we were on it, and we wrote four more. In the end we came out with nine TV spots. Which was pretty cool after only being here for two weeks and getting to go on a two week shoot and come out with nine spots. Which was pretty rocking. Cadbury's very, very, not conservative, they do good work, sometimes. But just anal maybe, I would say, if that is a .... We wanted to evolve the idea. And what else can we do with these factory workers and with these account team members and all this sort of stuff, or the marketing team. And the client was just really picky about, `We're not shooting anything outside of the factory.` It has to be these core people. We can only do these type of antics for the factory workers. We can't do anything really crazy because it'll tell kids ... Because you're advertising to the children basically, so it'll tell kids to do out and do these crazy things. So you can't do that. We have to use this terminology when referring to the gum. We always have to say, `It's ridiculously long-lasting.` There has to be all this Strid posters and branding all over the set. On the table, you have to have X number of Strid packs. And, even in post ... Because what they do is they shoot these number of spots, and then they put them all into testing, which is this rigorous process. And it's never testing for quality creative. It's testing for things that we really don't care about like brand awareness and all that sort of stuff. Which generally, the higher you score in testing, the crummier creatively your spot is. So, all creatives hate this testing process. It seems like it's a bit of a vicious circle, but I won't get into that. So that's always a pain. So you'll shoot the spots, you'll send them to testing. If it tests in the green, then the spots okay. If it tests in the yellow, than you have to address the things why it tested in the yellow. You have to go back to another cut where they say, `Strid.` Or in the end tag, you have to do something different to make the brand awareness more. Or you need a big banner that you go in in post and retouch onto the wall this big STRID banner with the logo and the tag and everything like that. And then they retest it. And they don't show the spot until it tests in the green. And then, once again, it's been death of a thousand cuts. And you just hope, as a creative, you get your cut first, and then you keep that and put that on your reel. And then they can do whatever they want to do with it. It's not your fault. But, it was a great experience. I'd been in the industry two weeks and I got to shoot all these TC spots. And it was sort of sink or swim. I mean we were able to get what we wanted. And obviously we shot a ton of spots, and we did a number of weeks of editing and things like that, which all adds up. Money wasn't a terrible issue. This was their big campaign. So they're gonna spend the money that they need to spend to get it done. And especially if they're gonna spend the additional money to put it all through testing. Because they pay for that. And then pay the additional money to have it re-edited. And then the additional money to have it retested. Money wasn't ... For the first spot it was an issue, because it was a flavor launch and they'd already set the date when the flavor was launching. So we had to have the spot ready for that. And then for the others we had a bit of time, because it was for additional flavor launches. So we had time to get them ready and fill in all those [inaudible 00:39:57] It was already an existing campaign, so it was trying to think of a better way than it had been done before. And where can we take these marketing team people and this president and do something funnier and evolve it a bit? But again, a lot of our inspiration was killed by client restrictions and things like that, so it was a bit difficult. So here's your guidelines, here's the campaign, now we need nine more spots to go with it. Good. At times, yeah, good. I think in the end it was just a bit frustrated. Because again, it was just death of a thousand cuts. They just were relentless with ... And the spots ended up suffering, in my mind, because of what they were trying to - Yeah. We always presented the work personally. It was a bit more of a laid back thing then Rolex, for example. It's a kid's brand. They wanted to hear from us. We're the target market, so why not here it from the horse's mouth? And that relationship was good. I always had a good rapport with all of them. One of our senior ECD's never had a good rapport with them. So that made things a bit tough at times. This person just didn't seem to have a good rapport with anyone. He just didn't have great client - Didn't have a great client, you know ... Social skills, yeah. Just never seemed to click with any of the clients. It was good. We were always really frustrated because they'd sort of promise things before consulting the creatives. The client would give feedback and they'd immediately promise it. And say, `Oh, yeah, we'll have it to you by the end of the day.` Whereas that's not the process. Get the feedback. Tell us. And we'll tell you when we can give it to you by, not vice versa. So that was really frustrating. We were about to kill each other, I think, at the end of it all. There was two account girls, and there was Danny and I, and I think we all knew that we were not very fond of each other at the end of it. Well, it was a great thing because I was able to shoot. But I don't think of it as a bad thing because this was my first experience with the industry. I think any project really has its ups and downs. I was just excited to be on a set and see what it's all about. And be able to do it and see it happen. And be able to call the shots, which is cool, because it all really comes down to myself and Danny, which is great. And to come up with an idea and then shoot it and then see it in front of you. And be able to spend a million dollars doing it. And get what you want. It was great. So, like I said, you get your cut first. And then you just sort of choose your battles from that point up. And it's never testing for quality creative. It's testing for things that we really don't care about like brand awareness and all that sort of stuff. Which generally, the higher you score in testing, the crummier creatively your spot is. So, all creatives hate this testing process. It seems like it's a bit of a vicious circle, but I won't get into that. So that's always a pain. We came up with one which I thought was pretty cool where we managed to get the president out of the factory, which was a huge task. And we got him into a convenience store, because we wanted to show the effect of the gum on the general convenience store owner. And so we had our Asian deli owner who was very pissed off that none of his Strid gum was selling. So he yelled at the president, saying, `It sold the first day but then no one ever came back.` And it's because the flavor lasts too long. So that was fun. That was good.   It was good. We were always really frustrated because they'd sort of promise things before consulting the creatives. The client would give feedback and they'd immediately promise it. And say, `Oh, yeah, we'll have it to you by the end of the day.`",

    "text": "I mean, we had a creative director, but they were always doing something else. And it was a big project. It was the website for this company. And there was all kinds of things that had to be filmed. I know we pissed off the director and a couple of other people, just from not knowing. Just from not knowing what's going on. So, I think that was ... I mean, just looking back on that, that was probably one of the worst experiences, I would say. Because it didn't turn out well either. Obviously. And they bought these spots, but then they, internally, I think the client was just ... like I said, they were still trying to figure out what ... They had six different variants and they were still trying to figure out what each variant meant. Like, volume versus straight-haired girls, curly haired girls versus whatever. And what each one of those looked like and what ... And so, we did one spot where we had sold them an idea that we liked, but I think when we sold it to them, they had some changing of the guard or something like that, or the idea just got lost in there somewhere. And they just second guessed it to pieces. And by the time we got on set, there were just so many ... all of that came out. I'm pretty sure they spent a lot of money trying to fix that. Because we ended up on set just, not fighting with them, but being like, `What do you want us to do?` We'd go back and forth to the dressing room, `I won't work with her again.` [inaudible 00:36:15]. But going back and forth, back and forth, and having them not make a decision, or one person will make a decision and the other person won't. That was the same producer that we worked with later, that we didn't like anyway, but we didn't know it then. And he was doing all this crazy shit behind our backs. He'd tell the production to do one thing, when we hadn't actually approved that. He'd tell the production, `Oh, I don't like dress on her. Do this one.` But wouldn't actually check with us about it. And we'd see and we'd be like, `That's not the right.`- Or not even the right dress, just like, that's not even the look we're going for. Why is that on her? And it just makes us- Right, exactly. And we felt like he was just bulldozing us constantly. And he's a really hard guy to stand up to, and be like, `We're the creative team. You should be listening.` It was the same client, but it was like they were all kind of involved all at the same time but there were certain people we would talk to for website and certain people we would talk to for more mainstream stuff. They had people coming and going all the time. On the TV, I would say mild. They wanted to be a lot more risky than I think they were willing to go. They would say that they wanted something and then they really didn't. I don't think they felt that they could go certain places. No, not really. I mean, there was time, there was deadlines and budgets and stuff. But the budgets, they were ... we never ran up against ... With them, we've never really run up against hard money lines. Because they're always really, if we say we need this, they're always pretty ... as long as you can justify it to them why you need it, then they're usually okay with it. They usually find money from somewhere. Time wise, the website was really fast. I will say that. The website was like, `We need a website.` And then it had to be up a month later. That one was really fast. And, which probably, I think, contributed to some of the problems that happened with it. Because it probably needed to be more thought out than it was. The website was dictated to us a little bit. We had to use these certain characters. And we had to do something with them, which was up to us, but we had to ... We just wanted to make somebody laugh basically, because it was so ... It was these three guys and they were supposed to talk all about hair. So, we didn't really have a whole lot of leeway to do a lot with it. I mean, I think we were just both really frustrated the whole time. On, not so much the website. I think both of us were just kind of like, `What are we supposed to do?` We originally didn't have a whole lot time to feel anything because it was moving so fast, and we didn't know what we were doing. So we were just trying to keep everything together. Yeah. It wasn't so much frustrating as it was just crazy. And we were just trying to check things off. The other one was just really frustrating because we felt like we weren't doing our jobs right. But we were also ... We also both realized that ... because I saw her doing her job and I'm doing ... and she saw me doing my job, but a lot of times when we got in those situations, we try to stand together. And we were working with another group, too as well. And so, we'd all try to come to a conclusion together and then step forward and say something. I don't know, it's been a ... We use it as a supportive relationship more than anything. But we've never really ... it's always been the same relationship. Restrictions on a project and also that ... there were so many decision makers and none of them were talking to each other. Since we're on the bottom rung of all of that, a lot of that fell onto us. And when things start going wrong, that's what people do. They start passing it down. There was nothing we could really do about it. So we felt out of control and also just helpless, but really frustrated for those reasons. Yeah. [inaudible 00:46:46]. That's how they work. They start with one thing and then by the time you end up shooting it, it looks something like you haven't seen. But they've changed ... Since we were working on that, they've changed creative directors and a number of other things, and clients and stuff. It was strained. The website wasn't bad, at all. It was actually the client, that relationship during that time was actually kind of cool. Because there was the people that were in charge of the website area of it, were really open minded. And they kind of got it. But after they left, it was people that didn't ... weren't as familiar with that. So then, it was harder. On the TV it was really a very ... it was just a very strained relationship. We felt like ... because they were, I think they felt helpless, too. I think everybody, it was a situation where nobody knew what was really going on. We were really trying to be understanding of that, but at the same time, I'm like, I don't think anybody was really getting what they needed from the other one. Good. They were pretty supportive. I mean, there was times when they- The TV. And account people weren't really that involved in the website that much. But on the TV, there was times when they probably should have stepped in a little bit, but they were okay. They knew of all, what was going on, they kind of tried to ... but they were caught in the middle as well. So, I think they did the best they could, under the circumstances. And on the website, too. On the website, we were in charge of a bunch of it, but there was other teams that were doing sections of the website, which I think is why it ended up being a little bit disjointed. Because it was a bunch of different people working on it. But it was really hard to get everybody in the same room to really have a focus. We were doing all this web stuff, this is also for Sunsilk but for the American client. And we were doing all this stuff where they just threw us in to it, production stuff, that we really weren't ready for. And we would ask for help but everyone was so busy. And so, we just kind of had to wing it.   And it was a great learning especially. We learned, that it was a very learn by fire. Looking back on it, it was really stressful. Because we really just didn't have anybody to ... you didn't know if you were making the right decisions. We didn't really have anybody to check in with.",

    "text": "Recently, we worked on this project, and Megan will probably say the same thing, the BoostUp.com project, which is, it's a product to help teenagers graduate from high school. Because there's 40% of them that aren't. They had that project going for a while under one of the creative directors here, but there was ... when we sat down, that we got put on it, and we sat down with it and realized that they needed to incorporate some dialogue and just open the whole thing up. There's this really cool opportunity to do this whole web element to it, and really tie everything together really well. It ended up being kind of, because that creative director left, very early on, and it was his baby. So, it was like okay, you know? What are we going to do? We had to talk to one of the other digital creative directors and he got involved, and then he left. It was a good and bad thing. Because on one hand, it's like we didn't have any real leadership. Nobody was doing it. Everyone kept leaving. We were the only ones that ... It was us and another team. We were the lead team and the other team wasn't really supposed to be on it, but they wanted to be. So, they were kind of helping, they were on it kind of incognito. It's been really rewarding because lately, especially it's been really taking off. And some of the messages that people are leaving, because the whole thing was meant to be, to open the dialogue between the students and the rest of the country, that the rest of the country could chime in and support them. Because a lot of times their support systems are just not there. They don't have parents- So, it allowed all these other people to have a voice and lift them up. And if you read some of the messages on the sites, they're really, really cool. All these people just ... some of them are really funny, and there's a touch of sadness to some of them. People having regrets about not graduating. But overall, it ended up having this really awesome feeling of hope, throughout the whole thing. And I think that was really cool. Some of the kids have even wrote back, being like, `Thank you so much.`- It's been really rewarding. But, it's a [inaudible 00:14:51] project. And actually the client on that is the Ad Council. They've been amazing the whole way through. But it was a really, really good experience because we didn't have anyone above us telling us, it has to be done this way. We were able to do it exactly the way we wanted to. Instead of such a dictatorship, it was ... when we were working at the web company, it was always a collaborative effort more so than a client telling the vendor what to do. And we didn't want that, because they're really good guys. The whole thing was a very, very creative, collaborative effort in the end. Which I don't know if it would have turned out that way, had there been a single person at the top, making all the decisions. Everyone had something to offer, and everyone ... me and Megan were kind of the ones that were always on it, [inaudible 00:12:50] putting out really good proofs there as well. He's awesome. And he kept everything together and made sure everyone was in the loop on everything and everyone knew what was going on. But there was only five or six people working on it. It was two teams of creatives, one producer, one account person. And that's it. That was it. For something that size, and for this agency, for something that size, for that much work, I mean, it was months of work. And the fact that we were having to do it on the down-low, because they were trying to kill it in-house, because they didn't know what was going on. We had to run in at the last ... We found out at one point that they were going to kill the whole project.   We had to run in to the CEOs office and show him all this work and be like, `Please don't kill this project.` Luckily, we were at a stage where he was able to look at it and be like, `Oh, okay. I won't kill it. I'll figure it out.` And if you read some of the messages on the sites, they're really, really cool. All these people just ... some of them are really funny, and there's a touch of sadness to some of them. People having regrets about not graduating.",

    "text": "Right, exactly. And so, we had to do a lot of research. And we came up with kind of something that we were like, `We don't know? Maybe this will be cool?`, whatever. Without really knowing, just what we could find on the web and from the account teams, what Russian and Italian women are like. But once we started working with the director, and then the account person who had previously been on it with some other stuff and our in-house producer, it was a really good project. Because, again, there weren't that many of us, but in the face of a problem being the main producer, all of us were able to come together. And it almost turned out really badly because of the production company was really pissed off at this producer. And they were like, `We're never working with you guys again.` And we were able to catch that situation at the last minute- They spoke with him a number of times, but I don't know, you have to know this guy. He doesn't really- And the account person is there to kind of make sure all the stuff from the clients' ends are being met and stuff. It's very, everyone has to be doing their job, because everyone was doing a different job. So, just by chance, we ended up talking to their line producer- We were on set, and they kept going over to our producer for decisions and stuff. He wasn't feeling well. Because, before then, every time we would try to speak up and we kind of got bulldozed. But after he wasn't feeling well, and so we got of a chance to take over. And then, they were like, `Oh, this is the situation.` And we're like, `Yeah, he's always like that. You guys know that, right? Don't take that too seriously. If you guys need something, come to us.` After that, it was so smooth. It was an Argentinian production company and they worked their asses off for us. They gave us such good footage. They came by and- The production company would have written us off. No, they would have done ... because they're under contract, at that point. We're paying them. But they would have written us off. They would have given us the bare minimum which probably wouldn't have been good enough. And we would have had to go to the client with a shitty spot, and had to explain to them why. Right. And why they've just spent half a million dollars on something that's crap. It's a really hard situation to be in. And everything has to go through the CCO, which is Ty Montague, who is the chief creative officer. But he kind of runs the whole show, and give it a thumbs up. Or if that's completely embarrassing, then he'll pull the plug. It feels like 15 to 20, but I'm sure it's not that much. Eight? I don't know. I don't know, because the meeting that we would go into with them, because it was usually over the phone, because it was in Europe. But there were people on some of those conversations, there were people in London, there were people in New York, but in other offices. And then there were people in ... where was it? France or something? Yeah. There was several different countries involved in every conference call. It was ridiculous. Yeah, but it was being run out of another office and it was really weird. I couldn't tell you. There's a lot of rules with them. They have a very distinct idea of who they think girls are. So, it's kind of hard trying to nail that down because they went through a long time where they didn't really know. They kept changing their minds. There's a lot of rules with them. They have a very distinct idea of who they think girls are. So, it's kind of hard trying to nail that down because they went through a long time where they didn't really know. They kept changing their minds A million times. Yeah, that I couldn't tell you how many times that changed. And I still think, they've gotten to a better place I think recently with it. But at that particular junction, I think they just had ... that was one of the hardest things is, trying to get them to nail down who exactly they were talking to. And what her, in their heads, what this girl's personality, what she thinks, what she doesn't like, what she likes. With that, yeah. Because they wanted to play it super safe. They didn't want to offend anybody, so they would go with, she was in [inaudible 00:24:34] things, and that's it. That was the main idea, that if this girl has volume in her hair, that she'll have to be daring and have all this confidence and do all these crazy things. Not really. That's one of the things Unilever is really good about. They're really good at ... they know what it takes to do a certain spot. I mean, there's always budget restrictions, but- Yeah. Because they know, hair is usually very costly thing to do just because it's not just going in and shooting hair. There's all this post production work. Every fricking hair has to be in place. And you literally have to go in and watch the editing people put each hair in place. It's ridiculous, takes a million years. But that also costs a lot of money. So, they know full well that they're going to be spending quite a lot. Time was ... Yeah, because they kept giving us more things to do. I say three spots, we wrote the last spot in Argentina. Because they decided that they needed to sell hairspray, too. They wanted to use the same girl and one of the same sets, but have a different spot. And so, we had to write it while we were down there and get it approved. It was always ... because they were always adding something else. It doesn't change that much. I don't know if it really changes that much. We try to really support each other. I think we both have our strengths and weaknesses and we try to play off of those. And I'm sure she gets pissed off at me sometimes. But in general, if anybody ... she's always there as a support. Which is actually really nice, because you always have somebody to back you up. Or disagree with you, that, too. That one was we were just trying to not make it stupid. We had this message that we had to get across, that volume gives you more confidence. We didn't really buy, but we were like, ` All right, fine.` And so, it was trying to find a way to turn that into something that's fun and interesting. I mean, the story behind that plot line was, this girl going into a train station, sees this guy. There was no dialogue, so it was all her. She sees that she's looking good that day and she's like, `All right, fuck, I'm going for it.` It's tough, because they were going through a lot of internal bull crap. I think they were trying to keep us out of. But we had one client that was awesome. And he was the fighter for us and he was really trying to ... he was on our side. And he was really trying to champion not going too far into, this is a commercial and it doesn't ... He was trying to keep it very, at least so it felt real. But we had one client that was awesome. And he was the fighter for us and he was really trying to ... he was on our side. And he was really trying to champion not going too far into, this is a commercial and it doesn't ... He was trying to keep it very, at least so it felt real. So, some of them, we had a really good relationship, and some of them we didn't have a really good relationship. And it was weird because it seems like the people that we did have a good relationship with didn't get along with those people either. But you have to deal with everybody. On that one, we had a really ... it was a friend of ours that ... well, she became a friend of ours, actually. But she's really, really good account person. It's really nice when account people know ... It's really nice when people know what they're doing because then ... It's like, if they don't know what they're doing it's really hard, and you kind of hate them. And if they do know what they're doing, they make everything awesome. And it makes it easier for us to do our job, correctly. Just knowing ... They're main job is really to manage the client, their client expectations. But also be able to get us the information that we need. Some of the bad ones don't do that. They'll leave out things thinking they're protecting us. And then, we'll do all this work and then run into these roadblocks that they've known about for months, that they just didn't tell us. And so a lot of it, if you have a really good connection and dialogue with the account people and the planners and the executives as well. Anyway, it's just the same teamwork stuff. I don't know about from that ... I mean, they told us people in Russia loved it. That's all we heard. It was on ... we found it on some website, but it's hard. until we got into production, where we thought the whole thing was just going to stink. And we ended up getting into production and being able to work with some directors and people in production here. And so, we had to do a lot of research. And we came up with kind of something that we were like, `We don't know? Maybe this will be cool?`, whatever. Without really knowing, just what we could find on the web and from the account teams, what Russian and Italian women are like. But we came up with this cute story, but it was up to the point that we sold it, we weren't really that excited about it. We didn't really, didn't care too much. And we had a producer on that, that was really, really difficult. And he got fired. He made things very, much, much, much more difficult than they needed to be. Because, again, there weren't that many of us, but in the face of a problem being the main producer, all of us were able to come together. PROJECT ID But in that particular case, the producer, who is the one who is supposed to making sure everyone is in on the same thing, was being very, very antagonistic towards this production company. And they felt like they ... We didn't know this, but they felt like they couldn't trust us. They didn't know us very well. They only knew him. They couldn't tell us about any of this stuff. Because, before then, every time we would try to speak up and we kind of got bulldozed   But it ended up being a good experience, because it, in the face of something going really, potentially, very, very wrong. Even the account person, we were able to go to her and tell her what was going on. And she was able to step in and help us smooth everything over, so that the creative process could keep going. Because it almost completely just stopped the whole train. But they would have written us off. They would have given us the bare minimum which probably wouldn't have been good enough. And we would have had to go to the client with a shitty spot, and had to explain to them why. Yeah. I don't know, every time I walk into those ... I remember walking into those rooms and being like, `Why is there all these people here?` But at that particular junction, I think they just had ... that was one of the hardest things is, trying to get them to nail down who exactly they were talking to. And what her, in their heads, what this girl's personality, what she thinks, what she doesn't like, what she likes. Time was It doesn't change that much. I don't know if it really changes that much. We try to really support each other. I think we both have our strengths and weaknesses and we try to play off of those. It's tough, because they were going through a lot of internal bull crap. But then there was this other stupid girl from France. I never met her, she was just on the phone all the time. And she was ... I don't know that she ever really knew what was going on. She always had something to say and it was never really relevant, ever. They'll leave out things thinking they're protecting us. And then, we'll do all this work and then run into these roadblocks that they've known about for months, that they just didn't tell us.",

It was just, I think, we were both since ten years in the job and we just talk with eachother and, so the idea came when we talk.   Yes. When we produced that, we had our director started to give his potential to the idea that it looks better. From production companies, somebody worked on the photography that was brilliant, so it was a team work in the end. It was not jut my partner. No, we worked for cars for long time, so if you would start today to do advertising for cars, you would have, for the first three months, the ideas that have been done because first they would have came.

    "text": "Corporation, company. And it was for the Christmas spot. No, actually, sorry. Yeah, that was just frustrating, just because, it was not a disaster. Far from that. But, it was frustrating because of the limitations of the project itself. I mean, one spot for Christmas, for diamonds. It just screamed cheesiness from a distance. And you knew that already, so from even before starting to work on the brief, on the project, and so it's a bit frustrating when your idea, like your goal, you know already that since the beginning that your goal is to, the best thing you can achieve is to make a spot that is not cheesy Corporation, company. And it was for the Christmas spot. No, actually, sorry. Yeah, that was just frustrating, just because, it was not a disaster. Far from that. But, it was frustrating because of the limitations of the project itself. I mean, one spot for Christmas, for diamonds. It just screamed cheesiness from a distance. And you knew that already, so from even before starting to work on the brief, on the project, and so it's a bit frustrating when your idea, like your goal, you know already that since the beginning that your goal is to, the best thing you can achieve is to make a spot that is not cheesy. So, not a great spot. Not something you're proud of. Just something that it doesn't embarrass you. And that's never a good place to be. When you get a new brief, you're supposed to be excited. But, when you get a new brief, and you know that the best you can do is not to do something embarrassing, it's not a great place to be. And the process was a bit tiring too, because we, you know, even if we knew that we could never do anything like amazing, we still tried to do something a bit different than what they usually do. Say, `Oh my god, that's even worse than what I thought.` So, in that sense it was painful. And in the end we got something produced. Decision makers in-house ... well, one frustrating thing is that in theory I, my role in the team was creative director. And when you're director of anything, you're supposed to make some decisions, but I had no decision input, whatsoever. So, that was frustrating too. That's always, when you feel that you're not, you cannot exercise your ... you cannot work fully, and express yourself fully as the role you're supposed to have in a team, then it's always frustrating, also from a creative point of view. Completely different from anything else. No other client will tell you, `Oh, we want to take risks.` Sorry, `We don't want to take risks.` They will always tell you, `Yeah, we want to take risks.` But, then you show something and they freak out. So, zero tolerance. Money was not an issue, because they have all the money. Well, you know, we were not rushing, so it was an issues, just because we knew that we had to deliver before Christmas. I mean, it's a Christmas project. You cannot postpone Christmas. Postpone Christmas. [crosstalk 00:43:51]. But, we had enough time to work in a kind of relaxed, not too stressed way. So, it was not a huge issue. Yeah. And it was okay, but you know, because we shared this frustration of knowing since the beginning, that okay, we're in a journey that was not going to be very exciting. You know, there was a lot of frustration. So, when you shared the frustration, the relationship with them was fine. But, when you share the frustration, you tend to sometimes, you know, complain about things, and influence, and effect the mood of the other person. Then gets depressed, because you're depressed, and then it's like a negative mood. I don't know, I don't think it affects the project in this case. It's hard to tell. It's hard to tell, because you know, you don't have anything to compare with. You cannot say, well maybe if we were more excited, we couldn't done something better. I don't know. It's hard. You're not, it's very theoretical, so it's hard to tell. There was not a lot of excitement, yeah. It's never good. I mean, you know that you're working with an autopilot on. Where did it come from? I don't know where it came from. We both focused on, again, we couldn't focus on what's the most creative thing to do for this brand, because there was no way to do something, because the limitations were so, you know, it had to be about love, about a couple, about a couple giving a diamond, a man giving a diamond to a woman. Showing the diamond, showing the reaction. Those are all elements that we couldn't get rid of. So, you almost knew what the spot would look like before even the brief. So, we really concentrated only on how to avoid the cheesiness. So, that it's at least acceptable, and when people watch it, they say, `Okay, that's nice.` It's not super creative, it's not revolutionary, but it makes me feel good. It's nice. They're not trying to sell me something too hard, or it's not cheesy. And actually, there was an article in USA Today that I received like last week, when they talk about the best commercials in 2007. And I was surprised, because that commercial was chosen in the 10 they chose for the exact same reasons. Like because it was not trying to sell anything too hard, because it was honest, and not cheesy, and not overselling. And there was always something that he didn't like. At the end, he picked this script. I think it was just the way they manage relationships. I think it was mainly ... the client wanting to show the agency, wanting to give a bad time to the agency. In the first meeting. Then the second meeting they chose a script, and they were very happy with the script. And then after that we shot the commercial, then we did the edits, then we presented the commercial that was exactly like the script, and the client was furious. Saying, `What is this? It's horrible.` I said, `But, it's exactly the same.` It's horrible, so it's really like a power demonstration, a demonstration of power. Like it's one meeting, I will be painful and torture you. The second meeting, I will approve everything. The next meeting, I will torture again. And after that, I will approve everything. It's really like a weird kind of relationship. We had to rework on the edit again. But, usually when you shoot something, you make sure that you shoot enough for different, for anything that can happen. Okay, if the client doesn't like this scene, is there a backup scene? So, you always shoot different options. Well, we have, you know, I tend to have really good personal relationship with everybody. So, you know, I treat them like friends. So, they were never really bad. I mean, usually, especially in big agencies, clients, account people usually look like they work for the client, instead of working for the agency. They're literally the mouth and ears of the client. So, sometimes it looks like they're working against you. And it was a bit of the case here too. But, because there was mutual respect and trust, and friendship, it went smoothly. Yes. And then there was, Ty, he ... we had to present all the scripts, and then he decided which scripts to present. He picked, I think, four or five to present. But, yeah that was my one impact, not my first impact, but one big impact with corporate America. And the very traditional thinking, very closed, narrow-minded, not open to any what if question. So, not a great spot. Not something you're proud of. Just something that it doesn't embarrass you. And that's never a good place to be. When you get a new brief, you're supposed to be excited. But, when you get a new brief, and you know that the best you can do is not to do something embarrassing, it's not a great place to be And to get hit on the head every single time with feedback that was more and more conservative. And say, `No, that's too far.` When we went only like this much too far. Like two percent too far. And they said, `No, that's way too far.` That's always, when you feel that you're not, you cannot exercise your ... you cannot work fully, and express yourself fully as the role you're supposed to have in a team, then it's always frustrating, also from a creative point of view. well, one frustrating thing is that in theory I, my role in the team was creative director. And when you're director of anything, you're supposed to make some decisions, but I had no decision input, whatsoever. So, that was frustrating too. `Oh, we want to take risks.` Sorry, `We don't want to take risks.` They will always tell you, `Yeah, we want to take risks.` But, then you show something and they freak out. Time was an issues, because yeah, it had to be very tight. You know, there was a lot of frustration. So, when you shared the frustration, the relationship with them was fine. But, when you share the frustration, you tend to sometimes, you know, complain about things, and influence, and effect the mood of the other person. Then gets depressed, because you're depressed, and then it's like a negative mood. well maybe if we were more excited, we couldn't done something better. I don't know. It's hard. You're not, it's very theoretical, so it's hard to tell. Painful. Painful, because it's a client that is very ... I don't know, a bit of a ... diva and likes to torture the agency, and make people feel his power. And to make people feel that he's the client, and we're not good enough, and he knows everything. So, before we got to that point of having a script approved, we presented, there were different teams working on the project. Five or six teams, maybe. So, a lot of teams. And we presented, I don't know, maybe 20 different scripts.   `What is this? It's horrible.` I said, `But, it's exactly the same.` It's horrible, so it's really like a power demonstration, a demonstration of power. Like it's one meeting, I will be painful and torture you. The second meeting, I will approve everything. The next meeting, I will torture again. And after that, I will approve everything. It's really like a weird kind of relationship. So, they were never really bad. I mean, usually, especially in big agencies, clients, account people usually look like they work for the client, instead of working for the agency. They're literally the mouth and ears of the client. So, sometimes it looks like they're working against you. But, because there was mutual respect and trust, and friendship, it went smoothly.",

    "location": "New York",
    "text": "Yeah. There were some different five a side futbol projects, but this one in particular was really successful in Italy, because it was, at the end, it was completely different from anything that's been done before, for that. And actually the tournament that I'm talking about, it's not even, it's not that we had to promote a tournament, we had to promote five a side football and Nike as a believable brand in five a side futbol. So, part of the idea was to create this tournament. So that the tournament was not there, so we created the tournament, and then we did all the campaign around it. So, the whole idea was not only a campaign, but the tournament itself. And, what was the question again about that? Because if everything is a, there are like tons of people who have to agree on things, and then there is no time, and then there's, so the process usually what kills or, you know, makes a project not as good as it could be. And in this case, the process was perfect. We started, we had eight months to work on it. I was based in Amsterdam. The project was for Rome. And the whole team of like two creatives, one planner, one account person, one producer, and the client, we were all based in Amsterdam, and we all flew to Rome for five days. That's at the very beginning of the project. There was nothing to brief. Just to interview people, to see, to go to see some five a side football clubs. To talk to kids. Talk to some DJs and radios. And it's not a coincidence. I think that's, you know, when you're in the right environment, you work from Rome, so you go to Rome, instead of it's like here, if I work for a campaign for Seattle, it's much better if I at least go to Seattle. And we don't often have that chance, that luck to do that. But, when we do, I think can always see it in the final product. So, the whole process was perfect. We had time, we had a great client, that was also like a friend. So, the relationship was really informal. And was a lot of back and forth between the agents and the clients. Yeah, that's what made the situation ideal, because usually the more people, the more messy it gets. Nike is a very unique and special client. They do want to take risk. If something is not risky enough, they won't even, at least at the time. Now, it's becoming much more corporate, but at the time, it was not that corporate. And I think that they were really looking to take risks, and willing to. That was very vague. That was really, really broad, and it was not something that inspired us very much. It was ... actually, the most inspiring part of the brief was the description of the situation in Rome, and the target audience in Rome. That was the most inspiring thing, and that's where the idea came from. The main message that was in the brief was just how to, I don't know, celebrate the passion of kids for, of Roman kids for five a side futbol. Super generic. Budget was a huge issue. But, because we wanted to do a lot of things, then it was hard to estimate a budget for that. Then once we had a budget, then of course it was too expensive. But, then we found out it was too expensive, because the agency was used to only work with some companies in London. And of course companies in London, like production companies are super expensive. So, we found a really tiny animation, because it was an animation project, an animation company in Italy, in Florence. Who couldn't believe their eyes when they got a call from Amsterdam and from Nike. Never done something international before. So, they did an amazing job, for nothing basically. So, that's how the project survived. And you know, we're good friends. So, we really enjoyed the process. And we had exactly the same ideas on advertising, and cinema, and music, and so we had a lot in common. There was no friction or anything. Friends too. And that's something that, again, it's not a coincidence. I mean, I'm not saying that I, that being friends is some kind of tactic to get, it's not that I want to make friends because of the work. It's, I usually enjoy working with, I believe in the idea of working with clients, like people who work for the same goal. So, we should work together, and it's usually nice people. There's no reason why, I've been lucky, maybe, in all my life. But, I usually try to make the process as informal as possible. And that's something really hard here in New York, for example, compared to Europe. Is that the relationship with the client is always very formal It's like this big table, and the agency on one side, the client on the other side. Then you see what you have. And again, it's not something that we do because we want to do good work. It's not some kind of manipulation of the client. It's really honest, and genuine. But, it's just, it makes things easier. There's a connection. Some kind of trust. And trust is fundamental. So that the tournament was not there, so we created the tournament, and then we did all the campaign around it. So, the whole idea was not only a campaign, but the tournament itself. And, what was the question again about that? That's at the very beginning of the project. There was nothing to brief. Just to interview people, to see, to go to see some five a side football clubs. To talk to kids. Talk to some DJs and radios. And the idea that got produced after eight months was generated at a dinner table, by accident. The client was there. All these agency people were there. And we were just talking, what if, what if, what if. It was not meant to be a working session. We were just talking and chatting, and at some point somebody said, `Oh, it would be cool if we did this.` And that's the idea that got produced. It was not like the agency against the client. It was really working together, but in a good way. And ... yeah, so everything went really great. That was very vague. That was really, really broad, and it was not something that inspired us very much. It was ... And we ... because we did, well it was an issue, but because we didn't have any media plan. I mean, we're not, they didn't, nobody told us, okay you have to do, you have to come up with a TV spot. You have to come up with a print page. It was really, really open. Come up with whatever you want that works. So, we created the tournament. We created a TV spot that was more than a spot. It was like a five minute animation that ran on MTV. So, it was more like content, more than just a 30 second spot. And you know, we're good friends. So, we really enjoyed the process. And we had exactly the same ideas on advertising, and cinema, and music, and so we had a lot in common. There was no friction or anything. PROJECT ID   I usually enjoy working with, I believe in the idea of working with clients, like people who work for the same goal. So, we should work together, and it's usually nice people. And one client here, which is Smirnoff. One of the first things that me and Raphael tried to do to get to know the client and to, you know, we went out for a drink, just to know them on a personal level. And that they could know us at a personal level. And we really tried since the beginning to make the relationship as informal as possible. Some kind of trust. And trust is fundamental.",

The very positive thing was, we provided a [inaudible 00:24:56] or a starting point from them to apply some of their market analysis. The bad thing is that, I think that, because of the breath of the project, because of complexity of the project, because of the moment, or the specific moment in the [inaudible 00:25:24], this project, this exploration was, I think not developed in a way that could really benefit the project itself. It was a good way to justify money, like to push money around because of there's X amount of money [inaudible 00:25:44] is investing with us or how we can, you know, make project ... it's money, so if not this, at the end of the fiscal year, will go at the end of the, outside the window, all this kind of things. The project could have been much more impactful, but and it ended up being good, but I think, I don't know how it's going to support and improve the actual final implementation. I think that's the biggest risk, especially when we have with big [inaudible 00:26:23] client, we're trying to be very strategic and we're trying to look at bigger pictures and sometimes we lose the importance of the detail, or the importance of how we can really be impactful, but this is very much a big conversation that comes up pretty often. I think it's because the type of projects we're doing is changing, and like for example, I think this Thursday is pretty well with a very good project that I believe we did is like, the two projects are back-to-back we did for Ford. It was, I mean, what IDEO has being doing for the past eight years is very, very risky, it's a lot of money they're investing. Risks tolerance, I would say very high, [inaudible 00:58:41] unexpectedly very high. That's been very much the core of our business, like a lot of ideas [inaudible 00:59:00] especially, like medical devices, and doing research and talking to people. I mean we have so much knowledge about the topic of diabetes. No, it was all right, I think that any kind of design work, or additional work that IDEO can do for Lilly, it's a good thing, so honestly, whatever we would have come up with, it would have been good for them, would be helpful. That's the problem, the fact that it was unfocused. No, I mean we forced ourselves to try ... again we forced ourselves to try to deliver something that would fit timeline of the bigger projects, so it could inform later phases of the bigger project. It was all about IDEO's effort in trying to constrain itself to be helpful for other IDEO's team member in a later phase, so very much important is the awareness of what is going on around, right, beside you project. Again users, and I think it's previous experiences, the history of the project, personal design and personal design opinions, but especially with those projects, with very longer, very big projects when basically, a lot of has been experimented, I think that the most important factor is being aware of all the works being down before. Inspiration would be do a thorough read and exploration and understanding of the previous work. To be aware how you can build on it and not to repeat something that has been before. Well, the client see all of them, but we agreed on a direction all together. It's very good, I mean, there's so much history and they're so used to see some of the faces involved in this project, I think. It's really [inaudible 01:03:54], but probably [inaudible 01:03:55] talk to Travis that now is owning the [inaudible 01:03:59] relationship and it is, you know, when you work together with a client for several years, it's good. I mean that actually, it's obvious like, let's try to make our life less complicated, that is already stressful, let's play nice, which there's no ... I don't think there's a hidden agenda, so it's pretty much everything on the plate because I think everybody recognizes the complexity and the difficulty of the work. Pretty uneventful, it was like okay, but it wasn't extremely passionate or it wasn't extremely exciting, pretty standard. It's like, `Okay, let's get the job done.` The bad thing is that, I think that, because of the breath of the project, because of complexity of the project, because of the moment, or the specific moment in the [inaudible 00:25:24], this project, this exploration was, I think not developed in a way that could really benefit the project itself. The project could have been much more impactful, but and it ended up being good, but I think, I don't know how it's going to support and improve the actual final implementation. we're trying to be very strategic and we're trying to look at bigger pictures and sometimes we lose the importance of the detail, or the importance of how we can really be impactful That's the problem, the fact that it was unfocused.

In my two years experience, I had like projects going bad, Okay, because if I look in perspective, all the things that could have work well, it's because, either because of inexperience",

Both of them ended up with very, very impressive experiences, prototypes, let's call them a word that we want, but something that spoke the language of our client, used to see like one scale claim models of cars and sit inside ... not working cars and looking at the nitty gritty details of the curves and streamline. The project itself, yeah was fascinating, I mean fascinating because that's what I like, it's very much focused on the, my strengths The project itself, yeah was fascinating, I mean fascinating because that's what I like, it's very much focused on the, my strengths, but the interesting thing is like how we were able to put together a team and get the teams so engaged and so excited to push the envelope to probably places where they didn't have precedence in the company. That's what I think, [inaudible 00:29:30] currently is missing, that's the reason I was saying, it's good and bad because to innovate and to be cutting edge, you need very much special occasions and company should nurture more, those kinds of situations, those kinds of occasions. Something I see it happen, more and more rarely. but the interesting thing is like how we were able to put together a team and get the teams so engaged and so excited to push the envelope to probably places where they didn't have precedence in the company It's easy to put everything together, especially for I think ... I think the key is [inaudible 00:32:50] identity, what ideal wants to be and wants to do in the future. It's either about being cutting edge or is it about being a good innovator that provide very equipped services for some specific clients. If it helps or it creates a good picture. The cool thing of this project, I think the big success was creating an environment that seemed like, you know the expression, skunk works, so it's like a very, very specialized team that is almost like the SWAT team. It gets the job done in and extreme focus and extreme passion fun. Successful was the people, the team, the environment created and the project comes by itself. I mean, the truth is that, we're all talented people, we're all very good professionals, we know what we're doing, so from that point of view risking [inaudible 00:34:36] is pretty easy. It's very rare to scrub with a project. Successful was the people, the team, the environment created and the project comes by itself. Right, ell, this brings up I think an interesting look or perspective into projects. There're projects that are purely focused on innovation and making something change. It makes some change and that most likely are the ones that have the higher [inaudible 00:39:28] involved. The ones that make innovation, but most likely make some executives or make some [inaudible 00:39:42], so the purpose of the project is to fault. There is actually, it could be ... maybe it does more but I can say, one is nobody is going to make any other decision, you're going forward, this is the project, we trust you guys, do it and we're going to put all the resources in places to make it happen from the clients side, or there's a project manager or someone that has enough power to collect three, four hundred thousand dollars, that see's IDEO as a very interesting way to introduce fresh air in their team. [inaudible 00:40:22] have to then basically respond to higher Ops and they're very, very nervous because, somehow their career is in place obviously, spending that amount of money in consultancy, quite often is risky. There very, very nervous, but I would say, 80 to 90% of the time, they get a promotion so, that's what happens and most likely that leads in to another project or into something new, something ... That's a good way as well to develop a relationship. The latter is a little bit more difficult, because it's high stress, because the person that is looking for a promotion is really very much aware of the fact that it cannot screw up, so it's very nervous for every step. The higher Ops don't have a problem, they try and if they see value, just like, go for it. No, I think it wasn't [inaudible 00:43:33], the project was good, I think it created a little bit of, to what we were discussing [inaudible 00:43:41], little bit of frustration knowing that it's a very much a unique occasion and it cannot happen very often. Yeah, we get briefs and generally, we say, `No, you're wrong, you really mean this.` The following phase was making up, so it was a walk-in prototype with different permutations. We went through evaluation, we had several ideas, we had people coming in doing tests. We got ... it was like a long process but overall, witnessed by the client, approved by the client, owned by the client, so all the decisions that were made, were not surprise at the end. The opinion is, we all have very much different backgrounds and influences, or what influences someone's work and that quite often goes up in to that place that we informally call the parking lot, that are basically all the unstructured ideas, that as a designer I know they're going to come back on brainstorm, so why are we waiting for the people to tell us that what they want and then brainstorm around those and go back to the parking lot ideas, that we generated without the process. It's a good way to let ideas out and focus on something else and focusing on the story, so [inaudible 00:49:03]. Yeah, focus on the other parts or the parts on how to tell a story, the part, you know because honestly from a process point of view, it's easier to go to the client and say, `Hey, this is what people told us and this is what it means and this is what we're going to do.` Rather than say, `Hey, here's a beautiful idea,` and the client says, `Yeah, but where does it come from, what's the foundation for it.` Right, and this filter is iteration and showing to the users, is talking to our client. Our client says, `NO, no, no, this idea we cannot really do because our other team is doing it,` and you know, it goes, even if it's the best idea on the project. I think that day-to-day interaction with team members was a little bit more difficult, but that's something that generally happens, because we know that we have to build ownership. We have to have people believing on what they're doing, what we're doing. I think the biggest satisfaction is when the clients start using your own words, it's starting like a repeating like a parrot. It's awesome because you know, that means that it's there, you don't have to [crosstalk 00:53:01]- That's to me for example [inaudible 00:54:26], one of the most exciting part, all about the relationship and all about how to make sure that message go through. Again, you can have the best idea ever, but if you're not able to take it until the end of the journey, it's not going to fly. Again, you can have the best idea ever, but if you're not able to take it until the end of the journey, it's not going to fly. all about the relationship and all about how to make sure that message go through Well, again, it depends, I think especially it depends on the context, like [inaudible 00:55:02] context, or in creative context, it's [inaudible 00:55:10] easier, because there's a lot of energy and passion but the aspect of ownership has a lot to be more rational. From a logistic and more business side, I think that is only to experience, so I think that if you're uncomfortable with the situation, because the client is not happy, [inaudible 00:55:41], because they're complaining about the cost because, and I'm giving examples though it wasn't the case in this project [inaudible 00:55:52]. From that point of view, I think it's pretty transparent if you have some problems or internal, or conflicts with the client, ask for help for somebody who is more senior for mitigation, yeah. It was like a big interaction design effort in trying to show, okay, this beside what you're going to [inaudible 00:28:41], is going to be how your information is accessed, flows and is displayed inside your car from the driving information, to the meeting information, to the diagnostics stuff. Our project was very much focused on providing a platform for the information architecture and information flowing inside the car for the entire fleet Something I see it happen, more and more rarely. The project itself, yeah was fascinating, I mean fascinating because that's what I like, it's very much focused on the, my strengths, but the interesting thing is like how we were able to put together a team and get the teams so engaged and so excited to push the envelope to probably places where they didn't have precedence in the company. hose people are not forced to be there, and the fact they are there I think it's amazing, yeah because there's the only drive, it's like the passion they have for what they're doing. That's the reason why I think, I'm not sure if these things are healthy for a business [inaudible 00:31:54], are definitely healthy for creativity, are definitely healthy for the people that are really passionate about what they do. Here we're talking about the fact that, we're making money anyway, but instead of doing a certain margin, we do another one and maybe we're losing money because people are working instead of ... 40 hours a week or 50 hours a week, there's working 80 hours a week, for three, four weeks. Those people are not forced to be there, and the fact they are there I think it's amazing, yeah because there's the only drive, it's like the passion they have for what they're doing. Those people are not forced to be there, and the fact they are there I think it's amazing, yeah because there's the only drive, it's like the passion they have for what they're doing. That's the reason why I think, I'm not sure if these things are healthy for a business [inaudible 00:31:54], are definitely healthy for creativity, are definitely healthy for the people that are really passionate about what they do. 40 hours a week or 50 hours a week, there's working 80 hours a week, for three, four weeks. We have vision on that, but nurturing creativity, nurturing innovation needs as well, have to go back to what we were saying before are very, very big tools of passion and common vision and common goals. They're like a very intense and passionate project, just having a little calmer, or I don't know, I don't have the  think the big success was creating an environment that seemed like, you know the expression, skunk works, so it's like a very, very specialized team that is almost like the SWAT team. It gets the job done in and extreme focus and extreme passion fun. I think the big success was creating an environment that seemed like, you know the expression, skunk works, so it's like a very, very specialized team that is almost like the SWAT team. It gets the job done in and extreme focus and extreme passion fun. I mean, we're people, like here at night, like having fun and it's not like, `Oh! My god! We're late, we have to do ...` no, it's like, there was like a room full of nine people, working every day until two in the morning, no problem, like fun. Going back home tired, exhausted, yes, but eager to come back in the morning after a good rest, so that I think was successful. Successful was the people, the team, the environment created and the project comes by itself I mean, the truth is that, we're all talented people, we're all very good professionals, we know what we're doing, so from that point of view risking [inaudible 00:34:36] is pretty easy. It's very rare to scrub with a project. We were not on top of that, [inaudible 00:36:43] is not in the best situation, financial situation ever. We had the occasion where we started working with someone that at the end of the project wasn't there, because of all the layoffs that were running, so pretty big. The ones that make innovation, but most likely make some executives or make some [inaudible 00:39:42], so the purpose of the project is to fault.

The higher Ops don't have a problem, they try and if they see value, just like, go for it. Extremely enthusiastic. Users. Yeah, we talk to people and we have two different way of doing things. We have a very much focused interview or either things that what we're call, extreme users or [inaudible 00:46:46]. Where you don't really look into the act of driving or the act of interacting with the tangible user interface or graphical user interface, with your car, but they have an [inaudible 00:47:01] way to dealing with it. I don't know. We went to see the interiors of our corporate jet and see how it was all laid out, so high complexity, high efficiency controls. We met with people that would more defied our cause and put like PlayStation and screens and other things in the car. That's why we'd like to talk to normal people with some specific need especially with, and we were focusing on specific type of car, more SUV and things like that. Yeah, focus on the other parts or the parts on how to tell a story, the part, you know because honestly from a process point of view, it's easier to go to the client and say, `Hey, this is what people told us and this is what it means and this si what we're going to do.` Rather than say, `Hey, here's a beautiful idea,` and the client says, `Yeah, but where does it come from, what's the foundation for it.` PROJECT ID I mean ... that's the point, I think we go through different levels and going from paper to electronics is a good way for us to do. An idea is a [inaudible 00:50:05], right, an idea can be a [inaudible 00:50:09]. An idea could be like a quick simulation of a picture with Photoshop on screen or an interactive one, so ideally, it works like this, it's this is quantity, and this is quality, so you start with a lot and build while you go up. In terms of the final deliverable, it's more and more refined. Yeah, I mean, right but the user is always the best way to tell the story, that's the reason why we always have test or what we call evaluation in between what [inaudible 00:51:43] we show progressively ideas back to the users and we get a gut feeling. We show down, we get a feedback and say, `Okay, we could take it to [inaudible 00:51:53].` We show it again and we get another feedback and you know and this whole action is incremental until where I say, `Okay, we have enough good picture that we can say this is it, or these are it.`   ask for help for somebody who is more senior for mitigation, yeah.

    "text": "They said, `Yeah, we know there's some issues with it, but you know, work it out.` From the very beginning ... and they were partnering with another company. So our task was to try to figure out how to integrate their drug and their drug package with this other technology. First off, the team really didn't believe in it. We didn't think it was really a very good idea, and we told the client that. They said, `Yeah, we know there's some issues with it, but you know, work it out.` And we brought that up to the client numerous times, and they just like, for whatever reason ... and they weren't very tightly involved with the program. They had a project manager assigned to it, but he wasn't really deeply involved with it. And I don't think he was really communicating to the people who were making these partnering decisions.  And I don't think he was really communicating to the people who were making these partnering decisions. And I don't think he was really communicating to the people who were making these partnering decisions. So we worked hard to try to come up with something that was reasonable, but the compromises that we needed to make just made it to be such a nasty device with really some really severe technical risks. I mean, he didn't really completely, no matter how many times you'd explain it to him, he didn't completely understand what the issues were. And it was very clear, no matter how hard we tried, it just was not getting through, 'cause he just wasn't the smartest guy there. Let's just put it that way. I mean, he wasn't the most talented, his background was not in devices ... Excuse me. It was in materials. He had a Ph.D. in like polymer science. He was not particularly well qualified to be doing what he was doing. So, nice guy, really nice guy, but he never got it. So we went through all the way to the end where we finally said that your package cannot do this in the end. I mean, we actually had a technical reason in the end why this just wouldn't work, and they finally ... It was funny 'cause like a month or two later, we found out that they said, `You know, we didn't think that was gonna work out anyway.` So we went through all the way to the end where we finally said that your package cannot do this in the end. I mean, we actually had a technical reason in the end why this just wouldn't work, and they finally ... It was funny 'cause like a month or two later, we found out that they said, `You know, we didn't think that was gonna work out anyway.` But you could just tell that somebody had made a decision in management ... well, I shouldn't say this. This is speculation. I think somebody made a decision in management. This is a promising technology, we're gonna partner with this company, we're gonna give them X number of dollars. And once that decision was made, I think it just is a big organization, and I think it just kind of flowed through the system. Some manager made that decision, or VP or something, and they were gonna take it all the way to the end. No, I think that was it. I think the thing that made it less than a great project was the disconnect with the team with the concept, they didn't believe in it, and the disconnect with the client, that they weren't very involved with it. So that combination. You might be able to live with either one, but you couldn't live with them both together. So I was actually working more with their partner than my client. Yeah, and he's very amenable kind of guy and had respect for us, but just didn't really understand what his role was in the project, and really didn't ... just didn't have a good basic understanding of what we were trying to do. And we saw that on other projects that he led, so it wasn't just us, I guess. It was good. Occasionally, it was a little ... it was good. I mean, occasionally it was a touch strained, but that was more because there was one guy who was being asked to leave the company, and that's when I took the project over. We had a new person that was just starting for human factors, so I wouldn't say it was strained, but it was ... we had some things we had to address. And it was very clear, no matter how hard we tried, it just was not getting through, 'cause he just wasn't the smartest guy there. Let's just put it that way. 'cause he just wasn't the smartest guy there. Let's just put it that way. I mean, he didn't really completely, no matter how many times you'd explain it to him, he didn't completely understand what the issues were He was not particularly well qualified to be doing what he was doing. So, nice guy, really nice guy, but he never got it. `You know, we didn't think that was gonna work out anyway.` He was not particularly well qualified to be doing what he was doing. So, nice guy, really nice guy, but he never got it But you could just tell that somebody had made a decision in management They were disappointed, but you know, it wasn't ... in the end, I don't think they were that surprised. and the disconnect with the client, that they weren't very involved with it.  it was kind of disconnected, so none of them were very influential or didn't really do a whole lot within the project. It was just kind of, you know, keep it running till the end. very vague. By the way, I don't think that was a problem. I mean, it was appropriately vague 'cause it gave us a lot of room to do it in lots of different ways. Yeah, like somebody's boss' boss knows exactly what they need, but we don't meet them until the final day of the project, yeah, that's bad. Most of those were ... the technical problems were so severe, the technical needs were really driving the forms. Some of it was about user need, but in that case, because the technical problems were so severe, they drove a lot of the architecture. eah, and he's very amenable kind of guy and had respect for us, but just didn't really understand what his role was in the project, and really didn't ... just didn't have a good basic understanding of what we were trying to do. And we saw that on other projects that he led, so it wasn't just us, I guess. it was good. I mean, occasionally it was a touch strained, but that was more because there was one guy who was being asked to leave the company, and that's when I took the project over. Yeah, the people weren't excited about it, so that didn't help either. I think part of the reason we had a lot of new people involved with it and people leaving it and all was partly because it wasn't a very inspiring project.  The idea of, `Oh, it's needleless,` that sounds great, but what it does is it has a very high pressure stream of liquid that basically tears a hole in your skin, that hurts more and it's a loud nasty noise.

    "text": "Yeah, it's kind of a weird question because teams are very autonomous here. It's not like we have to come up with something and then get it approved through something. Teams are pretty darn autonomous. There will be the practice person who's working with them, you know, like me, and then there'll be the team, and they're working closely enough that it's not like you run it by anybody, it's just part of the process. Strangely enough, budget wasn't that bad. Yeah, it wasn't bad. Time, no, not really, because clients are usually quite a bit slower than we are. So sometimes there's a real time constraint 'cause there's a show or something. If the client's not feeding into the project where we're kind of working independently, there's oftentimes a lot more time pressure. But in this case, they were developing the drug and the delivery technology in parallel, so we were going way faster than they were, so there really wasn't a whole lot of time pressure with it. So having some help in terms of ... But he was responsible for manufacturing, and he knew nothing about it. He was a really smart guy, but he knew nothing about it, so there were a lot of different things I would help him out on, just kind of advice and stuff. So we had a great relationship. Well, and it's also very ... From talking to these folks, just understanding the political realities of what's going on, the funding realities, just the whole politics of NGOs and the government and the whole process of delivering healthcare is so, so different- We want to design the whole system rather than design the device. And that's a common thread through all the work we do. But the problem is, and this is common with a lot of our clients, is there's a technology, but they need to figure out how to bring it in to make it useful for the stakeholders. So there's all the scientists, but they're not usually the best ones to figure out how to make it usable. So what we ended up doing was we worked very closely with the client to understand the technology, and in that case, they were looking at pain medication, so people who were in severe chronic pain. We went out to people and we talked to people that had severe arthritis pain or severe back pain or pain related to cancer, that's a very common one too, and understand what their needs were. We went as a team, and you know, that's something that we usually, we try to do is that the entire team goes out and does this stuff, not just dedicated human factors folks. Also, the client often comes on some of these observations too. I think having good client collaboration is every bit as important as good internal team collaboration, partly because they see the same things that we saw, so it's easy for them to understand why the idea we have is good because they've seen the need with their own eyes.

I think having good client collaboration is every bit as important as good internal team collaboration, partly because they see the same things that we saw, so it's easy for them to understand why the idea we have is good because they've seen the need with their own eyes But, we had a very tight team. We had an engineer, a human factors person, and an industrial designer. That's a very common makeup of a team for a device, 'cause in this case we were- Unfortunately it was only with one person on the client team, so we had a lot of ... When we went to meetings at the client, we often had a lot of resistance to the ideas that we had, just because he didn't have quite the power in the organization. But we recognized that and we designed our presentations and interactions with them so that we could ... they'd feel like they're part of the process and so they'd understand why we did things the way we did them.

But we recognized that and we designed our presentations and interactions with them so that we could ... they'd feel like they're part of the process and so they'd understand why we did things the way we did them.

When we went to meetings at the client, we often had a lot of resistance to the ideas that we had, just because he didn't have quite the power in the organization. But we recognized that and we designed our presentations and interactions with them so that we could ... they'd feel like they're part of the process and so they'd understand why we did things the way we did them. The CEO was also a big fan of ours, so it was a little bit easier there. I think that's another thing that makes something successful. Yeah, buy in from the top. But buy in from the top alone is usually not enough. You also need support at the bottom. You have that and then the middle can always be a problem because they are sometimes the most resistant because they have the most invested in the company in the way they've been doing things in the past. So, I think the other thing that made it successful, and I think it's true of a lot of things, when we tested these things and we had concepts, they weren't all like, we have a good idea and we're gonna have three variations of that good idea. We're gonna have four very clearly different directions. And even if it's like, you know, we don't think that one's gonna test well, but we can learn a lot from why it didn't test well and what people's reactions were- ... because oftentimes, we guess wrong. It's like, we think that somebody's gonna think this about something, and then you see somebody with severely arthritic hands and it's like, well yeah, but this one behaves differently than we expected. So it's always good to get a lot of different things out there so you can learn a lot so that in your final thing you design, incorporates all that learning. And usually, it's a lot easier working with startups because they can make decisions much quicker- So there's all the scientists, but they're not usually the best ones to figure out how to make it usable. We went as a team, and you know, that's something that we usually, we try to do is that the entire team goes out and does this stuff, not just dedicated human factors folks. But we recognized that and we designed our presentations and interactions with them so that we could ... they'd feel like they're part of the process and so they'd understand why we did things the way we did them. middle can always be a problem because they are sometimes the most resistant because they have the most invested in the company in the way they've been doing things in the past. successful, and I think it's true of a lot of things, when we tested these things and we had concepts, they weren't all like, we have a good idea and we're gonna have three variations of that good idea.

And even if it's like, you know, we don't think that one's gonna test well, but we can learn a lot from why it didn't test well and what people's reactions were-   Teams are pretty darn autonomous I would say it was moderate. I mean, their engineers were very risk-averse, their CEO was very risk tolerant. So it came somewhere in between, so probably medium. Originally, the client said, `Oh yeah, we want all these indicators and be able to tell them air codes and whatever this stuff,` and it's like, no.",

I was moving from Europe, so it wasn't my first time in states, but it was my first time moving to the states and everything was new and I needed to find a house, and I only had a mattress in my room, anyways ... I had someone from the other office [inaudible 00:25:20] coming for four weeks with myself, and then later in the process we had a contractor, regional contractor, it was a three month project and what didn't go so well was I wasn't integrated with the company, so I was working by myself most of the time for the first three months. I couldn't reach to other people to ask for help 'cause I didn't know anyone, so I didn't really have integration on the company, and the client wasn't prepared to receive whatever we were working on, so I had someone from the other office [inaudible 00:25:20] coming for four weeks with myself, and then later in the process we had a contractor, regional contractor, it was a three month project and what didn't go so well was I wasn't integrated with the company, so I was working by myself most of the time for the first three months. I couldn't reach to other people to ask for help 'cause I didn't know anyone, so I didn't really have integration on the company, and the client wasn't prepared to receive whatever we were working on, so- And so they did the phase zero projects, and then they did the phase one, and pretty much they keep Idea working because the budget was already allocated and everything was already in place, so let them work, but actually, we don't know what we want to do, so we were going further in details and we had questions and they had no way to answer our questions because they were not even sure they wanted what we were doing And so they did the phase zero projects, and then they did the phase one, and pretty much they keep Idea working because the budget was already allocated and everything was already in place, so let them work, but actually, we don't know what we want to do, so we were going further in details and we had questions and they had no way to answer our questions because they were not even sure they wanted what we were doing. So it's like very frustrating to have client that say, `Well, I just ...` the contact that came to us and followed the project was in their company for a month, so it was just like himself getting up to speed with everything and he was trying to give us answers and to follow ... To guide us according to his own vision, but he didn't have the company backing him up, so they never used whatever we were producing. Finished the project, we delivered, and they just forgot about it, it never became real. I mean, there was the two members and then there was, again, the service leader that would come. It was pretty much the only person that ... In that case because I was so junior and the other guy disappeared, so the project ... The practice leader was the one responsible for the project, and he was making pretty much the decisions. The expectations that the client had was proved that wasn't exactly the expectations that people had, so we tried to follow what the client [inaudible 00:31:31] Yeah, so when it got here we realized how messy it was and that maybe what we were going further wasn't what the client expected in the very beginning with this brief, and we tried to stop the project. It's never very easy thing to stop the project when everything is already in place, the contract, the money is allocated and everything, so I think bureaucracy was stronger here and we keep going into the project even though we knew that we shouldn't be doing, that was ... I was a bit frustrated when he left because we were ... Because of this attempt to stop the project we were late on whatever we needed to produce, so he had on the calendar four weeks expecting it on the end of the four weeks we would be in such a stage of the project and we were not, so I was left with whatever was still needed to do by myself. There was a bit of frustration, but not to him- But to whoever was defining the calendar because it wasn't his fault. The client, the client that came to us and said, `We are losing whatever specialty we had before, we are getting back ... Our competitors getting ahead from us, what can we do to leap frog and become the first ones?` And this was extremely atypical project for IDO, we got this project through ... The CEO of the company was friends with our CEO, so it's like you cannot say no to this project, you really need to do this, although you don't understand anything about financial services. he CEO of the company was friends with our CEO, so it's like you cannot say no to this project, you really need to do this, although you don't understand anything about financial services.

T And myself not being a native speaker was even more ... like, I have no idea what in the states financial services are so important, so it was a very high learning curve and it was very interesting because of that. Once we get it we get it and we could speak the normal language and go to the field and interview the people. I need to tell you in the first interviews we did everyone was like, `Well, I think I understood 40 percent of what he said.`  It was wasted because we couldn't understand what people were talking about, right? It was pretty much to get up to speed and then have all the questions, and the relation with the client was extremely good because they were also women, it was really funny, so they were very tolerant and very helpful to explain us all ... Everything we wanted to ask and the terminology, so it was quite funny collaboration and very surprising that they trust us, they really believed that we could do it, even though we were- Everything we wanted to ask and the terminology, so it was quite funny collaboration and very surprising that they trust us They were very confident that we actually were the right people to do the project, and it revealed to be really the case. The two weeks were more dramatic because we really felt it, we are really in the wrong place, and then you spend hours and you read all the articles in the magazines and ... And then you ask yourself, `So where is this [inaudible 00:41:22] in all this and so I think that was the middle ground that we could feel comfortable because we know what we are talking about and you guys can be helped if you do exactly what [Apple 00:43:14] is doing or what Target is doing could apply to your business. Okay, so leap frogging and getting to be better than the others, and what we came back to them and say was, `Listen, what you need is to clean your house and reorganize your offer because it's such a mess. You have pretty much a company made of acquisitions and you are not talking to each other.` So yeah, it became pretty much transformation project together with whatever online tools we were proposing. Yeah, we change a lot. PROJECT ID   I don't know. There is no recipes, you just try to minimize whatever new disturbances can come. I, for example, I had my boyfriend's birthday happening in the same week as we had interviews and my project manager was just like so nervous, so nervous, and scared and I couldn't ... I had no courage to ask her that I needed to fly to Europe to go to his birthday, so I just ...

The CEO of the company was friends with our CEO, so it's like you cannot say no to this project, you really need to do this, although you don't understand anything about financial services It was considered a service project, so again, it was in the service practice, and we were allocated three girls to an industry that's pretty much all men .. That did this project. We spent pretty much our first two or three weeks before even going to the field reading the manuals of people that study for financial advisors so we can catch up on all the terminology and all the concepts and all ... And myself not being a native speaker was even more ... like, I have no idea what in the states financial services are so important, so it was a very high learning curve and it was very interesting because of that.

And I think what I learned from that project was that pretty much design is everywhere, it's just a question of how you approach it and your mental model when you approach things. You don't need design by industrial design or communication design or fashion design, it's pretty much an obstruction because you can actually use design skills for every industry, so that was interesting to learn, but again, I don't know if I can talk about creativity here. Because what we pretty much told them was, again ... There is something we usually ... I don't know if someone already told you about cross pollination and how IDEO is always so much based on this principle that the more diverse people you join together coming from different experiences and from different disciplines the more likely you will have people saying, `Well, but this really reminds me of something else.` And you bring the mental model and the processes and trying to apply to the situation, and sometimes works, sometimes miss fires, so I think what happened here was exactly like we were so out of the industry and like that we could bring our knowledge and mental models from the consumer industry and apply them to the financial industry, something that no one else did before, and so I think that was the middle ground that we could feel comfortable because we know what we are talking about and you guys can be helped if you do exactly what [Apple 00:43:14] is doing or what Target is doing could apply to your business. It was a bit lower than the other one, there was mostly CFOs or whatever in the room, but they were effective, so they were pretty high. Whatever we were recommending them was pretty quick to be applied in reality, so it was pretty high. Quite high. Oh no, it was just ... Yeah, what we proposed them was ... Yeah, it changed. They were very focused on this idea of ... I don't know how to say ... Okay, so leap frogging and getting to be better than the others, and what we came back to them and say was, `Listen, what you need is to clean your house and reorganize your offer because it's such a mess.

It was just an idea which came, I don't know, it came out of nowhere really. It was the idea that you have the phone as a clip. You can put the phone into a holster and then flip it up. In this case, the phone is the clip. Yeah. The screen was on one arm and the battery was on the other side. Then in between it was flexing. That was just a very rough sketch. Then I made a model. Super basic. Super basic. Just simple shape. Then that got presented. There's always this back and forth. What's our idea and then how does the client react to it?

I think it was all about, again, this is the old school design thinking, you have to have one vision and then you have to really ... The idea is very much associated with a person.

And we, then, got a fantastic team of people together. Again, it hugely comes down to the client. Their acceptance to live with your response to that brief. Right? And not try and control you. I mean, I've also worked other automotive manufacturers where they've said, `No. But we want you to research like this and without demographic in that core consumer.` And this one was entirely trusting. And when we said, `We're not going to go and see your core consumers,` they were totally fine with our process. They trusted us and said, `You're going to get us there.` Yeah we're going to get you there. We had, I think, the first phase of that project was really successful because ... it wasn't necessarily financially successful for us. But it was really successful for the client and for the team. Just because of the impact we had on their organization to stand out their, what was called their brand DNA day. Where all the internal groups, their advertising partners have been working on stuff.

We're going to do that.` But, it just worked well because we managed to, of all things, put the jigsaw puzzle together of the team versus what the process was about very effectively. And I think that is ... an issue at IDEO is ... a consistent issue that we're not very good at is matching team to task. So, in this case, we knew that it was a certain type of research and we crafted the role for the right research and we got the right research for the project. And we knew that we needed a certain type of designer in this case. Much more strategic thinking. Not necessarily a form giver. Someone who's very capable of telling stories around the work that we're doing. So, it came down to a trust in client. It came down to, in that first phase, absolutely putting the right team together and aligning it around a common goal. In the second phase, the project ... so, the first phase was a team of five people. The project grew to a team of 10 people that were actually down here. Which is probably one of the bigger projects we've run in here in the last couple of years. And it's interesting that success, for me, wasn't just the fact that we delivered a wonderful end result that got shipped around the world for this company and everyone saying, `Yes we should do that.` Success was a lot down to the internal feeling of the project. And it's one of those things where it's project where I felt I grew. And probably, everybody in the room felt they grew as well. Because we didn't know how to do it when we said we were going to do it. So, we wrote a brief that said, `We're going to build this experiential prototype that someone's, pretty much, going to be able to sit in front of. And interact with. A full car dashboard.` We're going to have tested it. Which was a kind of breakthrough thing for us. . And it's interesting that success, for me, wasn't just the fact that we delivered a wonderful end result that got shipped around the world for this company and everyone saying, `Yes we should do that.` Success was a lot down to the internal feeling of the project.

A full car dashboard.` We're going to have tested it. Which was a kind of breakthrough thing for us. In here. And the client came in to watch the usability test and was blown away. Because we did this in, like, a week. And they have a six million dollar driver simulation room. And they're like, `But, this is more effective. You can change it really quickly.` So, little tasks like that were really positive. I think the general fact that we grew as a team because it was that stretch goal. We didn't know that we knew how to do it. And, actually, going into it, we didn't know how to do it. So, we curated this huge community feeling. So, that, for me, was ultimately why it was so successful and what was successful about it. Less about the object and more about the experience we had together. So, in the first phase there's probably five of us. And in the second phase, up to 10 at one point. And bridging, what was interesting about it was the collaboration that bridged across studios as well. So, we had Shanghai building things for us. We had [Paloalto 00:20:31] building stuff for us. So, it was that kind of huge company community effort to it. I mean, the first phase, it was me, basically, representing the client and the project manager working with me. But, to be honest, you have to treat everybody as having the same level of input and the same level of ... if they have a point to make, then you have to leverage that into the decision you're making. In the second ... what was, again, great about the second phase. Was the fact that it got so much bigger that we allowed one interaction designer to grow in his own team. And he led that team. So, I'd consider him an absolute decision maker. It was pretty much, I gave him the brief of the interaction design, and he went off with four people and made it happen. And then we had a design lead and an engineering lead. So, maybe, four people. But, to be honest, you have to treat everybody as having the same level of input and the same level of ... if they have a point to make, then you have to leverage that into the decision you're making. But, at times, during the process, they frustrated us because we would push and push and push. And we'd say, ` Look at what's happening in the world with regard to some of the consumer electronics or other big trends happening and interfaces and experiences.` And push them to the point of them breaking and saying, `No, we can't do that.` And then you sit back and six months after the project's finished, it's [inaudible 00:24:51] Six months after the project's finished you see something come out. Concepts show in Detroit or something and you'd be like, `sh*t. That's what we talked about.` The way of doing it would literally be on a laptop such as yours with someone in a desk and someone hacking away at it. And the usability testing is out of context. And when it is in context it was bizarre. It was task-focused. And, literally, they would tell someone, `Can you set the car to 72 degrees?` And that would be the testing. And if someone couldn't do it, they would wait until the person was almost crying from frustration from the fact that they couldn't do it. Which, to me, proves that you've got a problem if someone can't do that. But what the company would do, would then go and try and repeat that 60, 70, 80, 100, 200 times to prove that it was a problem. Whereas, there's a lot of research that's been written around statistical relevance of usability testing that says that, after six or seven people, you've got 80 percent of the problems. So, there's no point in just documenting that you know that that's a problem. f*cking fix it. So, we actually presented some statistical figures of one of the interim ... one of the final presentations that made their group vice president go, `sh*t, in 18 weeks, you've managed to get six iterations of this design in front of people three times.` We would barely have got one because of the way we have to work. So, they did test it in their own way. And then they modified their test method based upon what we did. F*cking beer bottles, paint canisters, everything. And, so, we managed to blow it apart and say, `Okay, that's fine. But you need to not look at this [inaudible 00:28:49] or interaction thing. You need to look at the experience of being in the car.` And, sure that doesn't mean seats and whatever. But, that means everything that's what we would call a graphical user interface or a tangible user interface. Things that people touch to control the car experience. That sh*t needs to be considered. And we managed to get them to that point. Which was pretty landmark, I think, for them. I don't think it would have been as impactful and successful. I mean, it literally would have been the way the company has always done it. Try and reduce it down to one little small thing that they can replicate everywhere. Whereas we're talking about platform approach. That's actually a lot scarier. So, when you talk about the risk of [inaudible 00:30:01] it was pretty ballsy of them to be able to go there. We had enough money. Clearly we quoted based upon the large scale nature of this. So, we certainly had enough funding. Time, interestingly, was a factor. That's another reason why I would consider the project successful. In the second phase, I remember, the team cranked through Christmas. Then we got a call from the client saying, `Yeah, you know we were going to present to the executive level committee on January 22nd? Can we move that forward to January 15th?` I'm like, `F*ck.` I've got a model being built in China. And we delivered it. We managed to do it. So, they actually ended up cutting a week out of an 18 week schedule. Which, when you're doing something as big as this, was huge. And we still delivered. And we delivered it. We managed to do it. So, they actually ended up cutting a week out of an 18 week schedule. Which, when you're doing something as big as this, was huge. And we still delivered. So, we spent time just hanging out. So this kind of, to a certain extent, was a reinterpretation of our research process. It wasn't about observation necessarily. It was about hanging out with these real people who, to be honest, are defining where the industry's going bit by bit. They're the bleeding edge. And that one piece of contact with what's going on out in the world was probably one that we all refer back to as the most inspirational. There's one guy who, in the end, we did me with him. He lived down in downstate Illinois. We usually pay our respondents like 200 bucks and tremendous time trying to schedule them and everything. This guy, after we hung out with him and talked to him online, drove up here without us asking. And was just excited to climb around in the back of his car and show us this sh*t. And he didn't want to be paid and it was just this amazing experience of ... Everyone talks about, in this world where we're all online and we've got so much access online, the trusted advisors, the experts that crop up in these incredibly obscure areas. He was the expert. He was truly an expert in his field and just couldn't be happier to actually share it with people. You have to challenge the way that we do research. And that's one of the reasons I think the process is interesting and needs tending to it right now. Because we live in a world where you should be able to find the experts anywhere and connect with them anywhere, anyhow. Because everybody's publishing what they know somehow. How many ideas? Wow. It was funnel effect. So, in the first phase, we presented an aspirational concept. Which, actually bit us in the ass a little bit because the aspirational concept was intended to illustrate five moments in the experience of being inside this car. And this company took a lot of the elements, very much, at face value. So, they were like, `Yeah, but you designed the steering wheel to look like [inaudible 00:34:44]` I'm like, `That's not important.` So, that was one learning experience for us. Actually, the prototypes that we hand off at the end of that kind of phase of a project are pretty much just actors to tell the story of the concept. Does that make sense? So, and it's been this before. This whole idea that sometimes clients take our work, too much, at face value when it's just supposed to illustrate your point. The design department hated us because their designers have design in the name. But their designers are really stylists. And we're fundamentally working at a different level to those guys. And I'm not trying to knock those guys at all. They're incredibly talented. My master's was at the Royal College of Art. I did vehicle design there and I just couldn't cut it. Those guys are f*cking fantastic. Just, they don't do what we do. So, the relationship was good on the whole. But, absolutely, in a corporation that big, you have to be able to navigate the politics and understand. A lot of the time we spent onboarding the design department to feel like we weren't trying to usurp them. We weren't trying to take their jobs. We were actually trying to work with them. So, we actually designed, at the start of one of the phases to start on the second phase. t was tough at times. But it should be. Because it means you're working hard. But, yet we had enough time to have a lot of fun. An awful lot of fun. And, as I said, it's one of the best project experiences I've had because people just pulled together. `No. But we want you to research like this and without demographic in that core consumer.` And this one was entirely trusting. And when we said, `We're not going to go and see your core consumers,` they were totally fine with our process. They trusted us and said, `You're going to get us there.` Yeah we're going to get you there. But it was really successful for the client and for the team. Just because of the impact we had on their organization to stand out their, what was called their brand DNA day. Where all the internal groups, their advertising partners have been working on stuff. And the project we did was the one that the CEO put up on the pedestal and went, `The rest of it's sh*t.

So, it kind of pulled together so many disciplines. And there was one point, in one of the rooms out here, where we kind of, as you said, `Where do ideas come from?` Late at night, someone going, `Well, we need to test these interfaces. And if we test them on a screen, that's not driving.` We're literally like, `Well, let's go and buy a golf cart and actually have people drive whilst they're using this stuff.` And that's not going to work. Going to be litigation or [inaudible 00:18:30] all over the place. So, we curated this huge community feeling. So, that, for me, was ultimately why it was so successful and what was successful about it. Less about the object and more about the experience we had together. PROJECT ID So, we curated this huge community feeling. So, that, for me, was ultimately why it was so successful and what was successful about it.

You know what? Usually 20. Because, in the end, we were bringing in people from all functions. It wasn't just product development. It was [R&D 00:23:12] it was advanced concepts, it would be marketing, it would be brand. Everybody. So, easily 20. Yeah.

If you want us to just do it like a control ... ` They're also fascinated with the iPod touch [inaudible 00:28:25] They were like, `We want one of those.` All our f*cking clients come to us and say, `We all need iPod [inaudible 00:28:33].` But you need to not look at this [inaudible 00:28:49] or interaction thing.

    "text": "So, we were really excited. It was a very broad project. But, contained. Does that make sense? It's like, it was one little thing we were going to get [inaudible 00:42:28] And we put this ... oh god, it's bringing it all back now. We put this team on it who ... I'm going to be really quiet because I don't want people to overhear me cussing about it. ... who just weren't right. We had a project leader who come from a brand and advertising background. And we were really excited to see her do her stuff in the brand side of this. And we had a researcher who was a very good but, solid functional ergonomics researcher, who's going to tell you what's wrong with stuff. That doesn't fit in my hand, all that kind of stuff. And we had a design ... the two designers who, kind of old school product development designers. And this was all about brand and brand experience. And what's the value proposition. And they just struggled from day one. And then we delivered this research report. And when I looked over it, again, the other day, I was like, `Oh my god. How did we get away with this?` Because this research reports goes through and tells the clients stuff like, `Design matters.` It's like, of course, f*cking design matters. They wouldn't be here paying a lot of money if it didn't. `Materials matter`, yeah we know. All these kind of truisms replayed back to the client. Just a mess And what designers need, as I said, the core. [inaudible 00:44:17] is, you need a brief. And our research, really, is our inspiration brief for our designers. Nothing there to inspire designers. Nothing there at all. So, when we go into the design portion of it, they were all over the place not knowing what to design to. And just, basically, spurting out ridiculous concepts that had no meaning. And somehow, I guess I was really busy, Jerry was really busy, we let this go on for weeks. I had a couple of terse phone calls from the client saying they were particularly happy. Wasn't completely happy. Didn't really feel like he was being listened to by the team. I was trying to work with the project manager who was from a brand background and give her enough rope because she, actually, was my peer in the practice that we had just hired. So, she was a very seasoned, very senior person. We were really looking for her to carry this and show us what she was capable of. So, I didn't intervene too much. It just got to the point that Paula, the project manager, turned around about seven or eight weeks in and told me two things. One, `I'm leaving.` Oh she was leaving our company, quit. And, you know what? I just can't motivate these designers, our designers to do anything that looks good. In the last four weeks, Jerry and I dropped in and scratched through all the research, found a little nugget and with the help, actually, John made some beautiful prototypes. Like, [inaudible 00:46:15] nugget of insight that was around comfort and fit. Which, I'll get back to in a minute. And created this whole design language of products around that. So, everything had this, very clearly spoke to the fact that it was user adjustable. Because the insight there was actually that everybody blames themselves for the hedge funds not fitting. Everyone goes, `This is a little bit bigger than that one.` They blame themselves. And we killed ourselves in the last four weeks. We wrote off so much money, it's unbelievable. Because we just couldn't see this cool project go [inaudible 00:46:55] And the end result was amazing. We pushed the project leader into a space where she wasn't comfortable with. And we didn't put a team around her that could support her. The team was still off in their own corners. And if you're going to do that, you're going to push a project leader to lead in a new area, you need people who have experienced that and have done it many times. And we over complicated it. It's a f*cking headphone. But, the learning for me there was, A about the team. We pushed the project leader into a space where she wasn't comfortable with. And we didn't put a team around her that could support her. The team was still off in their own corners. And if you're going to do that, you're going to push a project leader to lead in a new area, you need people who have experienced that and have done it many times. And we over complicated it. It's a f*cking headphone. And I look back at my notes and I wrote those words on day two of the project. And, yet, we went through 12 weeks of pain to get back to where we started. And, actually, have been having a longer conversation with people around our IDEO's process. And to say, `When do we decide to ... ` How do I put this? Because we have this kind of, very publicized process of ethnographic research to find our insight, synthesis into strategic framework. And then, ideation and all that bullsh*t, basically, all the way through. So, there's something to be said for ... I would never advocate that in a phase zero project. Phase zero, you're trying to figure out where the edges of the holes are in this cloud of fog. So, you need to be out there sensing the world, sensing the world, sensing the market, sensing, culturally what's happening. So, it has to be research focus to inspire. Otherwise you don't know what the f*ck you're doing. Well, and, therefore budget. Because we had to throw extra bodies at it. It should have been a sweet little project for us to make a ton of cash from, but no. Really good. Spoke to him this morning. I don't know how to say this without sounding completely trite. But our client relationships are the most important thing we have. And you have to work really hard at them. And I respect this guy for what he was trying to accomplish from what he's done with his company to date. We didn't do anybody any favors. So, we strained relationships within the team within the community because we didn't set the team up to do a good job of the task that we're given to dates. So, you can sit there from the outside and, to a certain extent, objectify people and say, `You didn't perform,` or `You didn't do this or you didn't do that.` But in the cold hard light of day, we put a team on a project that weren't set up to do it. Strong arming it. And then, it became passive aggressive. And then the hedge fund project came in. Like, oh f*ck. Okay. But we still want to do it because the client is really really nice. He's a super nice guy. And it's just an awesome project. And the first mistake we made was, we put the wrong team together. So, we had talked to the client early on. And he had said, the problem statement was really, `I can't get any product on shelf anymore at the high price points. Help me do that.` And we, kind of, said to him, `Well, sh*t you might need some brand work doing. You've clearly got a value proposition issue. And then, actually, kind of, 90 percent of what you make looks like sh*t. So you should probably design it to look nice.` who just weren't right. `Oh my god. How did we get away with this?` Because this research reports goes through and tells the clients stuff like, `Design matters.` It's like, of course, f*cking design matters. They wouldn't be here paying a lot of money if it didn't. `Materials matter`, yeah we know. All these kind of truisms replayed back to the client. Just a mess. I had a couple of terse phone calls from the client saying they were particularly happy. Wasn't completely happy. Didn't really feel like he was being listened to by the team. PROJECT ID And what designers need, as I said, the core. [inaudible 00:44:17] is, you need a brief. And our research, really, is our inspiration brief for our designers.

It just got to the point that Paula, the project manager, turned around about seven or eight weeks in and told me two things. One, `I'm leaving.` And two, `I can't get through to the product team. You need to help me.` But, the learning for me there was, A about the team. We pushed the project leader into a space where she wasn't comfortable with. And we didn't put a team around her that could support her. And it's absolutely relevant some of the time. But, the only reason we do research and the only reason we synthesize it is to inspire our designers. So, the question that comes up is, there are certain times when definition of inspiration isn't four weeks worth of research. Inspiration might be going to the shops for a half day. Or, it might be going to a completely analogous conference in Amsterdam or I don't know what it is. But, it's about being inspired. We had inspiration on day one. How do we change our model to be able to sell that to a client? Back to the Paula [inaudible 00:49:13] story. She had inspiration with the Citi Bank logo on minute three and she knew it was right. In phase one, often, I think inspiration can be completely ... can come from another place. Then, what's interesting is, then, using research as an evaluative tool to check that it's right frequently. I think you can start with, `We have a great idea.` Then, you just need to test it. Yeah absolutely. Because it was one of those things where you could go in ... it's useful because it allows you to know that you're going to be playing with products that can be made with more expensive materials. You're dealing with the kind of mass luxury of part of the marketplace. People who are willing to invest 100, 200 dollars in a pair of headphones. They care about something. It's not just which ones look best. `Yeah, you need to change your brand message.` Well, I can't bloody do that. What are you talking about? Go away.` Organizationally, you're not set up to deliver this. With this guy it was like, you know, absolutely. So, you can sit there from the outside and, to a certain extent, objectify people and say, `You didn't perform,` or `You didn't do this or you didn't do that.` But in the cold hard light of day, we put a team on a project that weren't set up to do it.   So, we strained relationships within the team within the community because we didn't set the team up to do a good job of the task that we're given to dates.",

The project was difficult in some ways but it was really satisfying because I was able ... I feel like I was able to take on some primary responsibilities for things that I have been learning in my career here so that was really good. I mean one of my team members I was working with and I were just really in sync about that so even though the whole team wasn't necessarily sure about some of the directions we were taking things, I felt very, very strongly about it and luckily about more than have the team did. There was really just one person that wasn't on board, so that was the tension the whole time to feel like we saw this great area of opportunity and this really important behavior that we needed to grapple with that made the project more complicated but ultimately richer. No behavior of the industry and what was happening. So there were two things going on. Like the project was about the space so they are going to build new pediatric clinics.

I always get into these projects where they don't really know what they want us to do, which I - So we had to come up with a whole strategy piece and partially what was important was that there were these ... the fact of the matter is today 75% of the pediatricians in their group are women of child-bearing age. So, the change in the workforce in doctors is dramatically changed the practice of medicine for pediatricians. So that was really interesting to be able to delve into some of those concerns and how ... like how is medicine going to grapple with mothers as doctors, because its just not doing a good job right now. And its similar to what's going on in design and a lot of industries where you know there's all these bright young women who, you know are the children of the feminist, but our society and a lot of professions don't build in support for that. So, you know, suffice it to say, the work was really interesting, the client was into it, like they were glad that we were talking about that kind of stuff so that's always satisfying, to bring up something that they didn't necessarily ask you for and for them to be like yeah, that is really valuable. So this is a separate discussion which we have had more recently like quite often we are really creating briefs with our clients. So, its ... the brief doesn't guide the project. You know. Its kind of like, you have to put a few stakes in the ground and it helps a lot to sort of frame the scope but then, once the project starts you know, you go into whatever's the most important.c So I mean, just seeing what else is out there in the world, like I mean I got a flu shot at a ready clinic at a grocery store in like a poor neighborhood in Houston. So, you know that was sort of inspiring.  this was really inspirational from the users point of view cause we were riding along with like parents with a newborn to go to their doctor's appointment, and just getting to see like what their whole journey was like and what their stress level was. nd then, a lot of the doctors were really inspiring. So just you know ... their passion for medicine, their interest, their live / work balance, and you know We got to interview a woman who had just had triplets. And she and her husband had been unable to have children, and they were both professionals so they were going through fertility treatment and they got triplets. So like her whole life changed. So that was like the difficult part. There was, I had a very close relationship with the researcher that we were working with. So has since left IDO but I worked with her probably throughout half my time here. So we're like great and we have really working relationship. There was a designer who was really junior who came in and he was really sweet but was not expected to participate as much in the strategy or like heavy lifting parts of it, just cause he wasn't ... that's not his strong suit yet. But he was good. There was a practice person on the team who was weeding the client relationship and then there was this difficulty where there was a guy who has been at IDO for a while but he had relocated here from another office. And he was supposed to be the project manager but it seems like only in name cause he had never done this type of project, with this type of client, and he just had a new baby.  I probably pulled back and just like interacted with the people who were easiest for me to interact with  I probably pulled back and just like interacted with the people who were easiest for me to interact with, to keep getting the work done and pushing forward and then this guys was left feeling kind of like frustrated -  a couple of us felt like, yeah he's not really leading, he doesn't seem to have ideas when we come to the table day to day. So I'm just going to keep working, rather than look to somebody for leadership cause its kind of ... you know, you either have to be the leader or you're not. And you can have the title, it doesn't make it the case.  feel like I was able to take on some primary responsibilities for things that I have been learning in my career here so that was really good. The project was difficult in some ways but it was really satisfying because I was able ... There was really just one person that wasn't on board, so that was the tension the whole time to feel like we saw this great area of opportunity and this really important behavior that we needed to grapple with that made the project more complicated but ultimately richer. And they didn't know. I always get into these projects where they don't really know what they want us to do, which I - And that has impacts on both sides, on the patient side and the physician side. So that was really interesting to be able to delve into some of those concerns and how ... like how is medicine going to grapple with mothers as doctors, because its just not doing a good job right now. And its similar to what's going on in design and a lot of industries where you know there's all these bright young women who, you know are the children of the feminist, but our society and a lot of professions don't build in support for that. So it was an opportunity for us to say how can this new strategy of like their pediatric clinics and what the centers are going to be like. How can that have some nod to the reality of the doctor's lives so that in some way the doctors are the users and the patients are the users, and to try to bring those two things together. Yeah, I mean. So this is a separate discussion which we have had more recently like quite often we are really creating briefs with our clients. [inaudible 00:24:03] a lot of sources of inspiration. So I mean, just seeing what else is out there in the world, like I mean I got a flu shot at a ready clinic at a grocery store in like a poor neighborhood in Houston. So, you know that was sort of inspiring. Yeah, so it was interesting in its way. And then, a lot of the doctors were really inspiring. So just you know ... their passion for medicine, their interest, their live / work balance, and you know, this was really inspirational from the users point of view cause we were riding along with like parents with a newborn to go to their doctor's appointment, and just getting to see like what their whole journey was like and what their stress level was. I mean there were so many really inspiring things that were about how tough it is to just like get to the pediatrician. She was very like clear, and very directive but every open to our design process and really looking for innovation and looking to push the doctors a little bit. So, it was a struggle to feel like you know like the pieces just never all fit into place. So, in a way, I probably pulled back and just like interacted with the people who were easiest for me to interact with, to keep getting the work done and pushing forward and then this guys was left feeling kind of like frustrated -   Cause, you know, a couple of us felt like, yeah he's not really leading, he doesn't seem to have ideas when we come to the table day to day. So I'm just going to keep working, rather than look to somebody for leadership cause its kind of ... you know, you either have to be the leader or you're not.

    "text": "Okay. I guess the first one that comes to mind. This is just very personal though. It was my first project. So, I started here basically, I started straight out of school, like I had done some freelance work and some other projects as a student and with like a professor but, I started here and I kind of like got plopped into the middle of a project with somebody who was also new here. But she had been a project manager at another great design firm. She was like very controlling. And I had a researcher I was working with and she was very harsh. And I've learned after I started that she was somebody who was not that stoked about me getting hired.  But she had been a project manager at another great design firm.

And I've learned after I started that she was somebody who was not that stoked about me getting hired. Like I was kind of told you have to do this this way and it wasn't like the way that I would do it. So I wasn't that good at it. So it was frustrating. And I didn't know how assertive to be about that. I kind of tried and [crosstalk 00:33:51].  I kind of was just like put to work to do kind of like the manual labor part, which was fine, but it felt like I didn't get to contribute in the ways that I wanted to. Like I was kind of told you have to do this this way and it wasn't like the way that I would do it. So I wasn't that good at it. So it was frustrating. And I didn't know how assertive to be about that. I kind of tried and [crosstalk 00:33:51].  You know I didn't participate in it as much but I could see the interactions with the client were just kind of difficult. She was somebody kind of at a mid tier in this ginormous company. So, I don't know exactly because I was like a little bit on the outside of it which was frustrating for me, but I knew that there were communications problems between you know what she wanted, how she wanted it delivered, and us just being able to do our work and what we thought was appropriate. There's always so much work to do that, its like, how much are we going to argue about this versus just like going, fine, we're just going - we need to get it done because I don't want to be here all weekend either. So, like we came up with all these concepts and we made like a bazillion models. I was at the shop making blister packs by hand, you know the prototype. And we use them in the field with people which is really cool actually. But we came back and it was like, this doesn't make sense. Like some of the premise of what the drug was going to be and their idea like didn't make sense and we told them that. And they kind of didn't care. They wanted this one solution which didn't do well, which users didn't like or really get and they thought was wasteful. They were like, no, no, no we like it. I think it was this woman who was the team leader on the client's side and her boss. Her boss was like, you know, Joey likes this one - They were like, no, no, no we like it. I think it was this woman who was the team leader on the client's side and her boss. So, like we came up with all these concepts and we made like a bazillion models.

I think it was this woman who was the team leader on the client's side and her boss. So we need to like fix that to make it better. Which was like, you know, not the way we ideally want to work. But we might have ... but it would have been like at our mid phase or final meeting where we're in this meeting room on their campus on their corporate campus and there were like 50 people that came to the meeting. And you know it was set up like an audience with like risers and these sort of desks and like the projection and you know that my two other Senior teammates presenting. And then these people in the back would just be like, well, you know, blah blah blah and they get into some technical jargon that's not even related to this drug or something else. Like they were so uninvolved in the process and uninvested in our work that obviously its going to fail. Like why are you even have people like that in a meeting if their not close enough to it or no interested in what we're contributing, you know, it doesn't make sense. There was our main client contact, so I would say, but we thought she was the decision maker but then I think the way the project sort of unraveled at the end, that there were probably more that we were necessarily well connected to.  I mean, by the nature of the company, I'd say that their risk tolerance wasn't very high, but the ideas that they fell in love with were probably more risky than what we were recommending. They were just kind of like, oh this will be cool. It was silly, you know. So, I don't know, just medium. I mean they weren't particularly risky but they weren't afraid of anything we were proposing either  They were just kind of like, oh this will be cool. It was silly, you know. We learned a lot about what it means to be an elderly single woman with osteoporosis and like how difficult it can be to remember to take all your medication and to go through special rituals for each kind of medication is really difficult. So just from a lot of their needs and struggles and aspirations too. I mean how much people who are ... you know its not like people with osteoporosis are deathly ill or anything, but just having chronic conditions just kind of wears you down. So seeing like what measures people take to be inspired or to feel okay about it or to remind themselves everyday that life is good and its not that big of a deal. So that was all inspiring to just think about like how can medication not be this like problematic thing that's a burden in your life. But she had been a project manager at another great design firm. She was like very controlling. And I had a researcher I was working with and she was very harsh. And I've learned after I started that she was somebody who was not that stoked about me getting hired. So I got put on a project with these two people who didn't have the best faith in me and it was just the three of us, and I kind of just felt like I had two bosses. And I was expected to do things in a certain way, which I've since learned is not really that typical at IDO, it was just a really bad way to get in the door. So that was frustrating. The client was really hard. It was a big consumer goods pharmaceutical company and - o I got put on a project with these two people who didn't have the best faith in me and it was just the three of us, and I kind of just felt like I had two bosses.

Yeah, I think its ... we would hope that its more intentional than that, but the realty of it is that pretty much since I've been here, we've been in a resourcing crunch. So, I think its always hard to match people to projects and sometimes unfortunate combinations are made. Also, in the long run, we all have to be able to work together so if its going to be that big of an issue, then its not going to work out.",

In that everyone was a very strong contributor, but respected each other, but also had healthy debates. So it wasn't like there was one person said something and everyone else did it. It was very much a shared load, and I think we all leaned on each other a little bit, and it felt like things moved very quickly. And there was no dead weight on the team, so to speak. Everyone was a big part of the solution. I think the place that we reached from a concept standpoint felt sort of like a breakthrough. So I think once we got to a point where the solution felt really good, that that invigorated the team to move forward. It was definitely a very difficult project. And like I said, I rolled on late so a lot of the difficulty happened before I even got there. So I think that the beginning of the project might not have been so smooth for the rest of the team. But I've been through a few experiences here where the team dynamics were a little off, or that people didn't understand each other's skills or something like that.

So I think once we got to a point where the solution felt really good, that that invigorated the team to move forward. It was definitely a very difficult project. I don't think budget was a big constraint, but time was a constraint because the nature of the project was very high level and, therefore, a lot of thinking through things in work. So I think that schedule wise we did well, and hours wise I think we did fairly well. Like we didn't work crazy, crazy hours and people didn't get really burned out. But it always felt like crunch time. We had two researchers working in collaboration with each other and [inaudible 00:17:28] from the service design and an industrial designer and myself.

I would say were sort of more of a consultant base, but they definitely helped launch things forward. They were integral, but not a hundred percent involved. Difficult. We had, and I didn't deal directly with the client, but the client was the mid level client who wasn't necessarily the decision maker or the most open minded thinker. I think was very high maintenance, as far as the time that he required. And he was sort of nervous, and always needed to see things earlier than we were ready with them to deliver them.   I think they were great, and that's one of the reasons that I felt like it was successful. I think that it works much better that way.

    "text": "Okay. It was my second project here and it was a six month project so it was a really long project. And it was a team of four of us. And I think part of, personally, why I didn't feel like it was successful, is because I wasn't happy with my role and it was mostly because I didn't know the company well enough to figure out how to make my role better. But it also was a situation where the project manager was very hands on and controlling of the content, and so it felt very directed instead of team based as a project It is a nice luxury to have to be able to go back to a client and say, we know this is what you want, but we think you really need something different. The biggest time challenge was that because the project was so large, although it had one decision maker on the client's side, there was a big team of people who were involved. We had check ins every two weeks for six months, so it really felt like we were racing to have something tangible every two weeks. Which made it, I think it interrupted things a little bit because it always felt like, if we weren't at a point to show something, we had to be. So we just had to sort of speed through things in order to get there. You know, I think that the relationship with the client was good and I think that it's continued to be a positive relationship in the projects following this, as far as I know.  why I didn't feel like it was successful, is because I wasn't happy with my role and it was mostly because I didn't know the company well enough to figure out how to make my role better. It also was a ton of work and we didn't have quite enough resources, but by the time that we got down to the wire it was a little bit too late to pull the right people in to help. But it also was a situation where the project manager was very hands on and controlling of the content I think it probably could have been a lot better. I didn't feel a whole lot of ownership over it, so I think that was part of my problem with it. Blood donor base. So we basically went in and tried to figure out what people's opinions are about donating blood and why they were, were not, and how to ... you know we found that once people got into the experience, it was often really chaotic and unprofessional and they never came back. PROJECT ID So that was the main things we focused on, is the mobile sites that often attract first time donors, but yet are the type of sites that are so disorganized because they move from location to location that people who have never been in a donor position before feel like it's really awkward. And people are yelling and fainting and they often never do it again.   I don't think necessarily.

    "text": "She was managing myself, and another full-time person here, and a freelancer. None of us knew each other very well and I don't think that we necessarily laid out skillsets, and expectations, and capabilities or ... you know, up front. She was amazingly smart, did a great job, knew her content, was very capable of leading that large of a project, but the team felt like we were being instructed to do things instead of actually a part of what was going on, which I think it just caused a lot of problems. I don't think there was a lot of ownership over anything and then we were all doing a ton of work. So it's sort of like the work with the reward of feeling like you actually can make it better with your experience and with your knowledge. I think that we sort of learned as a company, or as a location at least, that that sort of thing doesn't work to have someone leading a project who's not in the trenches of things. But it was a hard experience to learn through. I think so. It certainly let ... I don't think a location here will ever do that again. We had sort of a post-mortem or more positively, a project to recap afterward and jointly said that wasn't a good idea. We shouldn't do that ever again as far as the resources I think the outcome suffered a little bit because I think that ... I know for certain that the two other people who are on the team with me felt really disconnected and were sort of just finishing the work. I think that whenever you're in a position where you don't feel like you're doing your best work, the work could be better than that. Part of the problem may not be her fault. It may just be that she doesn't know us, so she was trying to keep a close reign to make sure the project succeeded. But without knowledge of the team, it's really hard to do such a big thing. You also can't let everybody go on blind trust and have it fall flat on its face, which I understand. The happy medium between it is really tough. Just out of respect for each other to try to feel like, you know, if you and I were working together, and I knew something was your sweet spot and I'm sort of indifferent about it, of course, it makes sense for you to do it. But if you don't know that about someone, it's impossible to have things go smoothly because you're delegating things that are somewhat random in a sense. So I think, as a company, if we start doing kickoffs and start having those conversations up front where we can really sit down as a team before the project even starts and sort of lay out on the table what ideally we'd like our involvement to be. Obviously, that's not always gonna fit perfectly. You're gonna have to do some things that you don't love to do all the time but I think that it can be ... That's the best way to manage it. Also, that I think the teams that we have that are the most successful sometimes are the people who worked together a lot in the past, which is sort of a no-brainer, but unfortunately it's not always possible We have an anxiety chart. I don't know if anyone's mentioned that or if you've seen it. It's sort of like a timeline from the beginning to the end of the project, and people get really excited in the beginning and then they get really ... clients this is ... get really stressed out, because we tend to do research and find some really interesting things, and then when we do synthesis and try to come up with how to apply our learnings, it gets really, really messy. There was a project manager who came from San Francisco to manage this project. She was managing myself, and another full-time person here, and a freelancer. None of us knew each other very well and I don't think that we necessarily laid out skillsets, and expectations, and capabilities or ... you know, up front. So as we got further along in the project, it felt as if ... She was amazingly smart, did a great job, knew her content, was very capable of leading that large of a project, but the team felt like we were being instructed to do things instead of actually a part of what was going on, which I think it just caused a lot of problems.  don't think there was a lot of ownership over anything and then we were all doing a ton of work. So it's sort of like the work with the reward of feeling like you actually can make it better with your experience and with your knowledge. And then, toward the end of the project, she actually had lived here for so long that she chose to move back to San Francisco and come back every two weeks. That was just a mess to have someone who is very controlling in nature of the content but not with the team all day long. It felt like everything we were doing every day, we had to check in to make sure it was okay. It just totally fell apart. She was absolutely the right person to lead it, so it was a conflict of where she was and we were. All the rest of the following projects have been done out of the San Francisco offices as opposed to out of this office, which is probably more successful just because of the cohesiveness of the team. It just made for a really messy, logistical project in the middle of everything.   Right. I think part of the issue, which lays it out perhaps a little too simply, is that the project manager has to have trust in the team. The teams that I've worked with when a project manager has trust, and respect, and confidence in the team has gone amazingly well. We've spoken about this internally, and we've tried to start a new structure where we have internal kick-off meetings that basically lay out on the table, `This is what I'm good at doing. This is what I like doing. These are my expectations,` or even work style or hours if you have limitations, and things you don't want to touch with a 10-foot pole. `I ran into a problem on my last project where this happened, so let's try to avoid that this time,` or things like that. We always do a client kickoff. We kick off with the client just to go over the expectations of the project, but it used to be rare that we had an internal kickoff just with the team. I think it's just really necessary. And to check in when things change along the way. But I've been in a few projects where we actually show the client this chart at this point, and it always makes them feel better because they sometimes feel like the project's just going south because they don't know and our process is really messy. We know how to deal with it, but a lot of other people don't. eah. Which I think, you know, even as a new employee, I did this through a project because it gets so messy. I've worked as a graphic designer for 10 years, but this is such a different environment than anything I've ever worked in. When you get to this point and you have no idea where the project is headed, you're sort of like, `What the hell am I doing here?` I think even for us, it takes us going through this a couple times in order to be comfortable with the range.",

He was going home every day at 5:00 which was just really refreshing, because I don't even remember what I worked on previous to that, but we definitely had lots of late nights, and ever since then I've had lots of late nights, so that sticks out in my mind as being nice. They were a little bit still figuring out some of the science and technology behind as in how long you would have to hold this applicator, some of those specs around things like that. How big certain things were going to be, but for the most part, they were able to give us enough constraints to work with I guess. Another nice thing about the project was that the makeup of the team because there were these two really senior people that totally knew what they were doing, and they had done tons and tons of health projects, that was a really awesome learning experience for me. Amy is our health practice human factors researcher and I don't know if you've met her, but she's a very strong personality. She has really strong opinions about the way things should be done. She's very orderly ... Yeah, I just remember it seemed like we had a lot of time. There wasn't a lot of pressure the way that some of the other project seem really, really fast paced and that was nice.  Mark went on vacation for two weeks at some point during it and so it left the whole project up to me and Erin, the other girl, and that was right when we were doing all this prototyping and we were about to go back into the field to get user feedback from people. She and I had never really dealt with vendors before and all this large scale prototyping but we totally nailed it. It was really fun and it gave us a little empowerment I guess, and a little taste of managing a little bit because we had some other interns that were working for us. We were the ones calling the shots and working with the vendors and changing drawings and fixing them and making sure everything was here and keeping track of everything. That was a little stressful but a lot of fun. I don't think so. I was less involved at that point with a lot of the budget and project leadership stuff, so I wasn't real aware of how things were going, but as far as I know it was all fine and we had ample everything.

It was actually very heartbreaking going to their houses, because these were people that were living with major, major pain for long periods of time and people that were ... they reminded you of your mom. This one woman, she had a son in high school, and they told her that she wasn't going to live to see his graduation, but she had lived to see his graduation and she was ... I still remember sitting in her kitchen with her and her crying and telling us about how if this thing was to work, just what it would mean for her to be able to go out and do things in the last months of her life. That was pretty motivating.",

There was some value in doing that, but he was saying there's no other way to do it because we've exhausted all the solutions.

It's not as strong of a process if it's just one person, I think, especially for me because I like to bounce off of other people and talk with other people a lot. The project, like I said, was myself and this more senior designer and he was the project leader. The two of us were responsible for all of the human factors research, but mostly me, because actually what wound up happening was we had a really tight schedule on this one and we were having to do all the research over the holidays and he was on vacation, so I would up going to a number of interviews by myself and trying to hold the camera and take pictures and conduct the interview all in one Then come back and share that with him, but he wasn't around. It's not as strong of a process if it's just one person, I think, especially for me because I like to bounce off of other people and talk with other people a lot. It was just always lacking and when we got to the design phase, he basically took everything and designed stuff and I felt more like I was just supporting him and doing what he asked me to do, rather than being this two-person collaborative effort. The other contributing factor was that towards the end of this process, the client company underwent a shift and they actually got sold. It was this huge consumer... I don't know what they're classified as, but consumer goods company that was sold to another huge company. I think because the employees knew this was coming, a lot of them left, so a lot of our team at the client side left. By the time we got to the final presentation, it was an entirely different team. The people that we were trying to share our end deliverable with hadn't been there for any of the earlier stuff, which I'm sure you've heard from people here, that's a big part of our job is holding their hand and bringing them through the whole process and the research and findings so that hopefully, they buy into everything at the end. Again, we had two main contacts and both of them left by then end. They had a more extended team of maybe eight or so people. As far as who were the decision makers there, I would say it was those two people. It changed a little bit because of this pet issue that they had about the in-shower thing. I think, initially, when conversations started with them, before this project came to be, it was really design something for using mouthwash in the shower. I think we were able to broaden it to say no really what are you trying to get at? Get to the root of what they were looking for was to increase consumption and maybe one way was to examine that. We were able to take the focus off of that one product idea and look more at the problem and have that be one element of what we looked at. That was all determined before the project started, too. That was crafted by our practice, BD people. Within the project, I don't know that it changed all that much. Time was an issue on it because we were two people trying to do three people's work over the holidays, which is tricky. What we ultimately gave them... we had found...we mixed up our research a little bit in that before we went out and talked to people we made a little pilot study to get at some of this in-shower use thing. We made three different types of shower possibilities and gave them to people and gave them a photo journal and had them go through using them for a week and then we went and interviewed them. That was part of our research. One of the things that we had given them that we had just found at a container store, people were using in all different ways that we hadn't even intended. That has really just been this rough, just get something out there in two day, we just designed stuff to send out to them. That turned into being...what we finally delivered wasn't really that far from this thing that we had found at the container store. A lot of the stuff that we got about adaptability and different ways to hang it and different times that people would want to use came through that product. We really liked our client contact on that one. She did get it and she would talk the talk and understand the user research and understand that the company was not real risk-taking and she was trying to push them to be more so and she understood that they're market research techniques didn't always give the right results that they wanted. It was unfortunate to lose her. It lost its seam when she left. It was really good with her. On the outset, we had a lot of fun doing all the crazy research was a blast. Towards the end it got kind of stressful because he was very dominant and shooting down some of my ideas so I lost a little bit of momentum by the end. At the same time, because it was just the two of us, I was responsible for a lot of elements of the final presentation that I might not otherwise have been. That was kind of fun. A little bit of time. We were really crunching to get through as much as we could before we lost these two people. Again, that was through the holidays and stuff, which made it tricky. I think that's the main reason that it was disappointing because I felt like...in some sense it was really collaborative, but then because it was just the two of us trying to do everything, it wound up just being all his design and I felt like it could have been better, it could have been more exciting.

I don't know what they're classified as, but consumer goods company that was sold to another huge company  It basically felt like we gave them this presentation at the end and they put it on a shelf somewhere and were like great, okay, so now let's start over again. That was disappointing too. Time was an issue on it because we were two people trying to do three people's work over the holidays, which is tricky. But I don't think budget was a problem because we had budgeted for a whole nother person by we definitely were short on time.

We had the right resources and the scope was a little bit exhausting for me because I was sort of a surrogate leader, project leader, because the project leader hadn't really led a project before, and was new out of the gate. So I was kind of leading from behind, which was alright. I was happy to do that, but I also was leading all the research, so it was kind of exhausting for me to build credibility with the client, do all the international research, and bolster the project leader. So I got kind of tired, but it was a lot of fun. We did a lot of good work, so that was really powerful. They were also undergoing a lot of internal head-rolling. There were lots of people leaving, so that was a distraction, which is where we decided we weren't going to invest in a longer term relationship just because stakeholder management was going to be a challenge. So that was fine. It was a classic IDEO project. It was three of us: me, Ken, and a guy named Quinn, who's left. And then it was Steve, who's now hired, but he was an intern from Notre Dame at the time. No, I think, you know, we scoped it tightly like we usually do, and we were, it was fine. I mean, it was tiring, but it was fine.  And my background's in Design Research and I don't have a Ph.D. in Psychology, so I had to really prove to them that I didn't need to have a Ph.D. in Psychology. So what I did was I did the research and then I brought in a child psychologist. So in that sense we did validate our premise, which was around the state, the psychological need states, for this age group of males. And he was like, `Yeah, you're absolutely right on.` Strained. They went a little bit native with us, as it were. The manager was just a very negative force. She was preventing the other two from doing what they knew was- Oh, they were good. Ken and I were, he was the Project Leader and I was really supporting him. It wasn't a formal, it was an informal role for me. We became friends through that too. And I got to know Quinn and was very supportive of hiring Steve as a result of that project. So they were all very positive. I had a great relationship with my direct peers on the mirror side of the client. On the client side. Their boss was kind of an obstructive person. No, it was their boss. I had a great relationship with my direct peers on the mirror side of the client. On the client side. Their boss was kind of an obstructive person. She was just clearly trying to build her own power, and that was a destructive force for the whole team. And you- I had a great relationship with my direct peers on the mirror side of the client. On the client side. Their boss was kind of an obstructive person. She was just clearly trying to build her own power, and that was a destructive force for the whole team. Not the quality, but I think it probably compromised the follow-through because I don't know if she was going to be championing it or making it actually happen. Yeah, it was fine. I mean, it wasn't a really complex project. It was about the psychology and the physiology of adolescent males, so it was quite fun. I spent a lot of time in bathtubs videotaping these boys shaving, and that was hilarious because they didn't know what they were doing, and they don't really need to shave physically, but they need to shave emotionally. That's part of their identity. So that was fun to get into that. So what I did was I did the research and then I brought in a child psychologist. So in that sense we did validate our premise, which was around the state, the psychological need states, for this age group of males. And he was like, `Yeah, you're absolutely right on.` And what was the inspiration? It was around: Where are they standing psychologically with their identity and what are their needs? And what they are exactly I can't quite recall. I mean, this was two years ago, but ... PROJECT ID They went a little bit native with us, as it were. The manager was just a very negative force. She was preventing the other two from doing what they knew wa She was just clearly trying to build her own power, and that was a destructive force for the whole team. And you- No, she just was ... She wasn't very ... She couldn't communicate very clearly and she was kind of talking out of both sides of her mouth and everybody could tell. It was very obvious. So that made it difficult to take direction from her, and she was in that position, so that was hard. We got to the point where we were sitting on the other side of the table from our client but winking at each other because their boss was making a fool of herself. So that was too bad.   And we made gestures to try and bring her in and inform her. We weren't working against her, but she just, she had another agenda that was never very clear to anybody, actually.",

It was okay. We probably should've redesigned the brief to be more inspiring for us because it put us in a `me too` scenario. We were trying to just figure out how to demystify the Nissan Murano and come up with something more exciting for Chrysler, which isn't a powerful position to be in for creative idea. Because we were focusing on the competitor we were looking too much at the competitor, and that wasn't very inspiring.

One of the problems was that there were multiple conversations with multiple practices before the project ever got going, and so the client kind of, no matter what was in the actual final proposal, in their memory was all the things they had heard from everybody about what they were going to get. That was a problem. We were very poorly aligned with the client, so that was a lot of the problem. We didn't take steps even when it was clear that we were misaligned to just say, `Hey, let's get some alignment here.` What they thought they could get, and what we could deliver, or what was reasonable to deliver. Or where the focus should be, whether it was a whole bunch of things shallow, or one or two things deep, like alignment around issues like that. One of the problems was it was mostly one and there was a lot of disagreement about the decisions. So the internal team was very poorly ... had very bad interaction. Yeah. The project leader would make decisions that people disagreed with. Well, the client was really two clients trying to collaborate. Very different goals. Very different goals, where the guy who was the CEO of the existing clinics had very short term operational kinds of things that he was interested in, whereas the pharma company was really interested in this as a unique new touchpoint to see what that would mean for them in their business. There wasn't really the time or the budget to address both of them in depth that they would need to be explored in, and so it ended up being one of these things where there was a shallow view of everything taken that just wasn't satisfying to anybody. Very low. Always bad ingredient. You'll see that, I'll give you that one for free. You don't have to analyze your data for that. One of the problems was that we didn't even ... it was all over the place, and I think that we just didn't go back and revisit it enough. You know what I mean? t's a great example of how we're having growing pains in the work we're doing now. It's very different kinds of work and it requires very different kinds of project plans and things like that. It was basically treated like one of our old project development projects, and that's part of why it didn't work well. Time was fine. The budget was wrong That's why they were bad. We were just misaligned all the time they would do stuff like be made uncomfortable by something, and instead of directly having a conversation with us at the time they go away and write these very formal emails, which we don't respond well to. So things were just not above board and director talked about. People were struggling and they took it out on each other. I see this happening more and more here actually when people get uncomfortable instead of bonding together, because they're nervous they end up taking it out on each other.  It gets very, `If only X had done their job better we wouldn't be in this place,` it's that kind of thing, which is just so the complete opposite end of the spectrum from how it should be, or how we talk about how we do our work. Yeah, I just had one. One of the problems was that there were multiple conversations with multiple practices before the project ever got going, and so the client kind of, no matter what was in the actual final proposal, in their memory was all the things they had heard from everybody about what they were going to get.

Somebody in the Ventures Group who was in charge of this as a start-up business, and then they also had funding from one of the major pharma companies. So there were two very, very different things that each, that the pharma company and the CEO of the Ventures, of the actual existing clinics had. There was very different goals that they had from the engagement. Very different goals. Very different goals, where the guy who was the CEO of the existing clinics had very short term operational kinds of things that he was interested in, whereas the pharma company was really interested in this as a unique new touchpoint to see what that would mean for them in their business. Yeah. It was certainly too small for what really needed to get done. The budget was way too small for what needed to happen. It's a great example of how we're having growing pains in the work we're doing now. It's very different kinds of work and it requires very different kinds of project plans and things like that. It was basically treated like one of our old project development projects, and that's part of why it didn't work well. Like clients will do, they pushed for as much as they could get and there was serious scope creep and we didn't stop it. That's why they were bad. We were just misaligned all the time and they would do stuff like be made uncomfortable by something, and instead of directly having a conversation with us at the time they go away and write these very formal emails, which we don't respond well to. So things were just not above board and director talked about. People were struggling and they took it out on each other. I see this happening more and more here actually when people get uncomfortable instead of bonding together, because they're nervous they end up taking it out on each other. There was one particular team member who really did that, and then the other three team members, actually with each other, got along great.   When people feel uncomfortable and they feel like they're not getting to a good place work wise and they need to kind of like ... so they get testy, or they'll decide that there's a weak link on the team. It gets very, `If only X had done their job better we wouldn't be in this place,` it's that kind of thing, which is just so the complete opposite end of the spectrum from how it should be, or how we talk about how we do our work.",

It was also just something where the skills of the team, the multidisciplinary nature of the team, really was essential to make it all work out. Well, we ended up going all the way through implementation, so I think in the end it ended up ... back then that was a lot, it was a 18 month, million plus program, but that was mostly because of the detail, the implementation stage, which we just don't do anymore on projects. Probably three. The problem is it's like decision makers, there's a kind of ... the people that were in the respective disciplines were the decision makers on the ... Decision makers the wrong word I think, but I know what you're getting at. If you look at other places there's people feeling disempowered, but ... I think the problem is that when you think about it, here it's like on a very multidisciplinary thing. You have to have a key decision maker for each discipline, so you've got to have a lead engineer who says, `There's no way we can make this.` You have to have a lead human factors person who says, `These are the problems to solve.` You have to have, in this one, a lead software engineer, and you had to have a lead ... well, the industrial design was ... so it's hard because one of the things is that ... I don't know, it's a rare situation here where the project leader just overrules the team and says, `No, I disagree.` You know what I mean? The idea inspiration ultimately was a moment in time when we saw a surgeon reaching for a tool. We saw his hand position, and we said, `That's what we want to design to.` That was the ultimate inspiration for the hand piece shape. Then the other thing that was very unique about the design was that you could move the blade by just the fingertip control, and what made that happen was watching the cords get tangled with the old instrument as they had to move their hand like this. So the inspiration for it was the research, the design came directly from that. People got along. People respected each other. People worked together. They were very involved. They were very engineering centric and so there was a rapport there. It was a tiny little team on their side, and that was the difference too, it wasn't one of these things where we had these meetings with lots of people. I wouldn't say they function like a start-up, but it was a small core group that we worked very closely with.",

    "text": "And a positive experience was that we worked really well together, there were no team issues at all the entire time. We had a really nice client. So that's all good sort of atmosphere, like there was no conflict or anything like that which can certainly spoil things. And we pretty much developed some pretty quickly some interesting frameworks that I think were really robust and I think that was really satisfying because it sort of set the tone for doing good ideation. We had some really strong ways of thinking about money in more emotional ways rather than transactional ways and how people feel about their money and sort of developed certainly from some of the patterns that emerged from the research and stuff like that. And it sort of came a little bit easily in a way that there was no real ... It wasn't hard to convince the client that these were useful frameworks, we came up with ideas, we came up with things that were ... They wanted a broad range, a landscape of things, we did some concept testing and some things bombed, that's okay, we learn from them and we were able to pick them up and turn them into something else. So there was a very nice and I think partly in the work we do, since we have clients, that if a client is making the team very, very apprehensive at every step of the way, they can sort of cause them pain because they don't have that freedom to sort of fail. And with a good client that understands that you're going to put out concepts and sometimes you know in fat they didn't go, after the first concept review, I remember with users, I do remember now they said, `Gosh, is this the way it ... ` A couple bombed, or no, it didn't bomb but like really didn't resonate with people and we said, `Well, this is normal. We throw out a range of things and we sort of hit the extremes and we still learn something from the ones that didn't do well.` It's not about yes or no, it's about using prototypes to learn something. And once we told them that, they understood it. They went, `Oh, that's interesting. Okay. That's fine.` `We can handle that.` So I think that that's part of it is that you sort of, if there's a nice atmosphere, like that project where there were no big conflicts or things like that to get in the way. And plus the work was strong, it sort of came together and there wasn't this sort of days of swimming around and not coming up with anything. Like it progressed really, really well. In fact at the end of it, we were remarking that we sort of didn't have any late nights, it was very smooth in the sense that we just made progress every day. Every week we just kept on chugging along and checking off little pieces of it until we got to where we needed to go. And it wasn't this sort of sense like [inaudible 00:16:27], `Oh, my God, we made no progress.` It's like it was this very, very sort of very continuous thing. So it was very satisfying. There are projects where like you literally can go a week and like you feel like you made no progress That's part of what made it a very good project, there was a core team of like five people on their side that were there consistently through the entire thing. As far as real decision makers, I think there were two of them that were real decision makers and they were there for the entire time. And they were very, very straightforward. I mean, I remember we had one meeting and like, `Love this,` and then they said something else, `You know what? We really don't think you hit it there.` And they were very, very open and honest and straightforward the entire time. They were excellent clients. And having clients that tell you exactly where you stand, there's no second guessing, they tell you in real time, makes for a very happy team because yeah, well, we didn't quite hit it there, that's okay, and I forget which meeting this was, I think that there was a ... One thing we promised in the brief was to really understand how to access these people, not just develop solutions for them which we really did pretty well, but also how do we find these people and how do we connect with them was part of the original briefing and frankly we didn't really deliver on that. So they told us, like, `You didn't really deliver on that.` Can you repair. So yeah, so having that really tight team with the client side is I think it's hugely valuable. But it doesn't always happen. I tend to evaluate in what we do, the chance of getting something to market with, innovative thing to market with a bad client team, just it lowers the chances of success measurably because it'll get stuck in the organization and never get out the other end. If you have a very tight and powered client team at a high level organization like this, I mean, all of them reported directly to the CEO and so they were absolutely empowered to make decisions and feel responsible for them. They were looking to do something innovative, they were not looking to do something crazy. So I would say risk is ... There are times when risk was ... They were open to things that were risky, ultimately I think that they weren't looking to completely set up a new business. So I don't know how that means from a risk point of view. So, something that meant a completely new business model with a brand new business, completely different organization, that's a highly risky thing to do. I don't think they were prepared to do that. I'd say medium high, medium high. They were certainly not risk averse but I think that they were looking very much from a ... As we really settled into a direction for what they were really going to pick up on, they started to go back and just saying, `Okay, what does this mean for our business?` So I think that they were willing to consider pretty radical things but then sort of had to be tempered by how does it fit in their business model. No, the timer budget was just, that's why it was so smooth, it's like the team just went through, we hit all the milestones, there was enough time to do things, it wasn't a problem. No. And there was a real insight there about that allocated and unallocated money are really quite different in people's minds and right now there aren't systems to support those differences. So it was a real pretty, I think pretty profound insight that the team found. I made a framework to explain it, why it's true, and then we ideated around it, and came up with a pretty unique solution. This is a subsequent project, but the phase here we're talking about, we already had these initial concepts that we're teasing around this thing that got conflated into the next piece of work. But we had a couple really key insights, I think, that really had a lot of power behind them. Well, it was good, we had a brand new person to [inaudible 00:26:26], it was his first project, so that was ... And my role a little bit was to help mentor him through the process from a research point of view. He was certainly an experienced researcher but not in a place like [inaudible 00:26:40]. So it wasn't a hard thing to do but there was a little bit of a learning for how to sort of settle differences between doing research for research's sake and research in the service of design. They're slightly different, the techniques may be the same but how you process the data and the kinds of frameworks you develop are different because you're developing frameworks that are useful for design rather than ones that are useful for explaining the world in a descriptive way. We tend to develop what I call more generative frameworks rather than descriptive frameworks. And I think there's a subtle difference that researchers need to understand. So that was [inaudible 00:27:21] but he was all open to that. The project leader was very experienced, I worked with him on several programs, we've always worked well together. And the other designer on the programs, I've worked with her several ... So, I knew the other people, a new person who was willing to learn but very smart and sharp, so it wasn't an issue. It was a very good team. Yep. And how do you think about their Gen Y customers, they weren't doing real well attracting them or retaining them, didn't have a real presence. They were under market share for that segment and they wanted to think about how do we, we're obviously not thinking about them right, what do we do? And so we took a pretty broad look at the financial lives of young, particularly tech savvy people. And younger, they weren't all super young, but people over 21, people sort of under 40. And we pretty much developed some pretty quickly some interesting frameworks that I think were really robust and I think that was really satisfying because it sort of set the tone for doing good ideation. We had some really strong ways of thinking about money in more emotional ways rather than transactional ways and how people feel about their money and sort of developed certainly from some of the patterns that emerged from the research and stuff like that. It wasn't hard to convince the client that these were useful frameworks, we came up with ideas, we came up with things that were ...

I mean, all of them reported directly to the CEO and so they were absolutely empowered to make decisions and feel responsible for them.   They did, although not as soon as we had expected them to. Actually, it didn't happen in the space of this project, they did it in a subsequent project where they did some ... was a great brief, actually, it was a nice ... And we worked with them to develop it. So it wasn't a hard thing to do but there was a little bit of a learning for how to sort of settle differences between doing research for research's sake and research in the service of design. They're slightly different, the techniques may be the same but how you process the data and the kinds of frameworks you develop are different because you're developing frameworks that are useful for design rather than ones that are useful for explaining the world in a descriptive way.",

    "text": "So the brief was they had five stores and they weren't yet making any money and they had done some research that nobody in the industry was really making any money and they were saying, `So, [inaudible 00:29:08], could you help us figure out what our service offer is that's going to be appropriate and differentiate in the marketplace?` Because they were considering besides just doing a acute care things, like when a kid has a sore throat, is it Strep? Considering like should we do cosmetic things like Botox or should we do massages or should we do nutritional counseling, I mean, they had no idea what they should do to sort of just get beyond this sort of nurse in a box mentality, which clearly wasn't making anybody any money. And ultimately, people like minute clinic in Target and Walmart are going to do better at that because they've got scale. So, they knew that wasn't going to work, so that's the brief, what should our service [inaudible 00:29:55] be? We went, `Great. We can help you with that.` It was two clients that it wasn't even apparent in the beginning, so it was the Care Works sort of head of this group, plus it was partly funded by a pharmaceutical company, and we weren't clear at the beginning how they had an agenda that was slightly different from ... So we sort of had two clients that wasn't clear upfront as the brief is done what their relationship was, they weren't quite clear to us about it, there was a little bit of sort of like ambiguity there, so that was a bad setup. We had a client contact that was I think he wasn't super, super sharp in the sense he had good perspective. So that as the project went forward, he kept on not understanding that you do a strategy that's pure, that has a very strong point of view, versus he's dealing with, `What am I doing next week with my sign up sheets in my clinics?` So he couldn't let go of the day to day- They had different ... As things started evolving, they went different directions about what they thought was important and as opposed to reconciling those differences along with a coherent vision, they started working independently. So, this is one of those things like particularly when you get into service clients that are ... I always tell my clients, `If you really want to do innovation, you have to let go of operations and focus on strategy.` And having that person who just couldn't let go of the operations influenced the team, the [inaudible 00:32:42] team, and sort of held them back. And there were a couple clear moments where we had some good insights about what it means to do this sort of supportive care direction and that the nurses in these boxes were sort of doing it but were getting acknowledged for it, it wasn't part of their brand, [inaudible 00:33:02] and they said the client really bought in on the sort of supportive care direction even though it wasn't new, we sort of had some good reasoning for what it really meant. They had thought of supportive care and stuff like that but we said that this is the direction for you, it really fits with who you are, it fits with what your nurses are doing, and it fits with being in a grocery store because you have things like the props around the grocery store to use as ways to sort of talk about lifestyle changes and things like that. So, thought that that was a really good fit. Now, the problem is is that it takes you in a direction that has a different business model, it takes you on ... They were very focused on the 15 minute visit because that's their business model, supportive care takes you on a pathway of 30 and 60 minute visits, also takes you on the pathway of having maybe two people in a facility. So as we started developing concepts, the client pushed back on, `No, it doesn't fit our business model, we can't go that way.` They were very focused on the 15 minute visit because that's their business model, supportive care takes you on a pathway of 30 and 60 minute visits, also takes you on the pathway of having maybe two people in a facility. So as we started developing concepts, the client pushed back on, `No, it doesn't fit our business model, we can't go that way.` The fact that the client sort of pushed back, the team said, `Okay, well we can't do the two nurse things, so let's go this way.` So they were sort of comprising what they were doing. And the response was, by one team member, `We're still going to have to talk about supportive care, but not all the way over here.` And the other one says, `Well, let's give them some value by helping them fix some of their day to day issues.` And so that the fact that we ... Okay, so just two different clients, responses are different, so you end up with ... You know, a real innovation has to take something and really push it all the way. And you get all these factors that sort of get in the way as barriers and you end up with [inaudible 00:35:16] as hard as you can. Then you end up with something that in the end, yeah, we gave them some good recommendations how to improve what they're doing but it's not going to set them on this really differentiate offer to the marketplace. Which may have been hard to do, but it's going to be differentiated, which is what they asked us for. I did part of the up front sort of business development and worked with them because I had worked and I said rightly that I would be involved but I was quite busy and couldn't be as involved as I would've liked, I couldn't do all the field research, I couldn't be at every single meeting. I went into the field a couple days just to sort of see their offer and I was at most of the meetings but not all of them. I think part of like compare contrast to PNC, that when they made a decision, they felt good about just moving on, made the decision, we felt good about it, we're going to move on. The Care Works people, both they were second guessing themselves all the time. You know. They couldn't make a decision and move on, they kept on returning to things that had been discussed and we thought had been decided and they kept returning to them again and bringing them up over and over and over again. They just can't leave things behind. They weren't sure how to navigate their own organization on what was going to be valuable to them, frankly. I think was low in a sense that it was actually quite risk averse because the fact that he wasn't even willing to consider a different business model, which wasn't even that big a stretch. There are other people, players in the marketplace that had a two person staffing model and he wasn't willing to consider it because he sort of was afraid of the investment cost. So I think it was low. He was very risk averse. He really couldn't take the plunge into actually considering something radically different. He asked for it but really couldn't go there. The brief was, `What should our service [inaudible 00:41:03] be?` But then they kept changing what they wanted. So one thing that inspired us is really trying to understand what would motivate doctors to want to partner with these things and what kind of relationship and role. So I think it was really looking at the balance between the different stakeholders, I think that really sort of inspired this direction. So I think in this particular case it was really a good sort of understanding of the whole picture, of sort of the stakeholder, the relationships between the various stakeholders that could be if you thought about an offer, that really thought about those relationships to support those relationships and the communication between them. That you could have something really differentiate. So, but again, to pull it off was a radical leap because the client reaction was, `Well, it's going to take a long time to establish those relationships and they don't trust us now.` Well, duh. Are you trying to do something differentiate or not? Really just not good. It was difficult discussions, people returning to issues that were left, couldn't move on, not clear decision making on their end, and frankly, we didn't necessarily push them to make those decisions sometimes, so it's not all their fault. Yeah, they had a breakdown, which had to have an intervention but they repaired and completed the project. They weren't talking to each other. They literally were like significant like statements like, `We can do this, we can deal with this later, but right now we just have to sort of work apart.` And then I actually intervened and facilitated a reconciliation before the end of the project that helped the team get back together and sort of acknowledge their tensions and the [inaudible 00:46:24] of their tensions and to move on and that did work They literally were like significant like statements like, `We can do this, we can deal with this later, but right now we just have to sort of work apart.` And then I actually intervened and facilitated a reconciliation before the end of the project that helped the team get back together and sort of acknowledge their tensions and the [inaudible 00:46:24] of their tensions and to move on and that did work. And then I actually intervened and facilitated a reconciliation before the end of the project that helped the team get back together and sort of acknowledge their tensions and the [inaudible 00:46:24] of their tensions and to move on and that did work. Well, I think it was a different, they started, since there was confusing about exactly what the final endpoint would be, whether it was more is it for helping to get what they're going to do next month or help them with their overall strategy, [inaudible 00:46:49] the team, they were mixed, so the response for the team was different. So since they were frustrated with the client, one team member said, `Well, we just have to make it more actionable, we have to do more prototyping around these very near term things that they can use right away.` And the other person said, `Screw that, that's not going to be valuable to them, we really need to do this.` And they disagreed on how to handle the response to the client. So they started- Right, since the client was unclear, the team became unclear and then they disagreed and then they didn't resolve it and there was ... And I don't know the whole history or the detail about how the breakdown happened but it was, I guess, it was just sort of a bad day can lead to a worst day where something was said and then it comes into personal relationships about having perspective about. But when there's so much confusion about where you're heading, that can cause the team to have anxiety anyway. Right, it exacerbates it, so then it became a little bit of ... You know, personal style [inaudible 00:48:07] at this point because you're not, there's already some tension, there's some uneasiness, there's some anxiety, there's a client issue, and then a personal style thing can have more importance. Like how people communicate or don't communicate well or how do people handle tension. Some people close up and some people will lash out. And the personal style things, they start to come up when the team isn't functioning. Well, I would say there were a little bit because the two people having the most tension were both very experienced people, both of them had been here for 10 years or more, so they were both in their own right were experienced, either one of them could've really set the direction for this. It turns out they just, they couldn't reconcile between the two of them. So in a sense it wasn't power as much as they both knew what's right, they were both very confident that what they thought was right.  So in a sense it wasn't power as much as they both knew what's right, they were both very confident that what they thought was right. . So we sort of had two clients that wasn't clear upfront as the brief is done what their relationship was, they weren't quite clear to us about it, there was a little bit of sort of like ambiguity there, so that was a bad setup So that as the project went forward, he kept on not understanding that you do a strategy that's pure, that has a very strong point of view, versus he's dealing with, `What am I doing next week with my sign up sheets in my clinics?` So he couldn't let go of the day to day- He couldn't let go of the day to day operations of his five clinics were up and running from the fact that we were looking for sort of a longer term sort of strategic direction for them. So, that sets up a very bad dynamic because you can't serve both things equally well. And then we ended up having a team that didn't function very well. They had different ... As things started evolving, they went different directions about what they thought was important and as opposed to reconciling those differences along with a coherent vision, they started working independently. So, this is one of those things like particularly when you get into service clients that are ... I always tell my clients, `If you really want to do innovation, you have to let go of operations and focus on strategy.` And having that person who just couldn't let go of the operations influenced the team, the [inaudible 00:32:42] team, and sort of held them back. `No, it doesn't fit our business model, we can't go that way.` And so that's sort of like taking the insight, developing a concept, and then really following all the way through. The fact that the client sort of pushed back, the team said, `Okay, well we can't do the two nurse things, so let's go this way.` So they were sort of comprising what they were doing. And the response was, by one team member, `We're still going to have to talk about supportive care, but not all the way over here.` And the other one says, `Well, let's give them some value by helping them fix some of their day to day issues.` And so that the fact that we ... Okay, so just two different clients, responses are different, so you end up with ... You know, a real innovation has to take something and really push it all the way. And you get all these factors that sort of get in the way as barriers and you end up with [inaudible 00:35:16] as hard as you can. The Care Works people, both they were second guessing themselves all the time. You know. They couldn't make a decision and move on, they kept on returning to things that had been discussed and we thought had been decided and they kept returning to them again and bringing them up over and over and over again. They just can't leave things behind. Well, they were senior in a sense but they ... Innovation groups have to sort of respect their sponsors in a way, they're in the service of the larger organization, so at the end, this is where they worked there at the beginning, who all the stakeholders were, they got nervous because they weren't sure whether their stakeholders in the pharma organization were going to like what we were doing. Or was this work getting them what they needed. But they never explained that to us in the beginning. So, they had sort of unseen stakeholders, unseen to us. There are other people, players in the marketplace that had a two person staffing model and he wasn't willing to consider it because he sort of was afraid of the investment cost. So I think it was low. He was very risk averse. He really couldn't take the plunge into actually considering something radically different. He asked for it but really couldn't go there. Well, they said, `Can you help us figure out what our check in procedures should be?` It's sort of like, it's like they wouldn't let it stay at the strategic level, they kept on sort of going back in the tactical level and so again, it's sort of like they couldn't separate their current operations, what they needed to fix tomorrow, from where they should be going in the future. And so it was a constant problem for the team. I think that it could've been budgeted bigger, I think they sort of had a budget and we sort of worked with their budget, so I think ideally it would've been a little bit more time because it is sort of a business strategy. I think that time to some degree that there's more clarity, it would've been enough time but the fact that there were so many of these issues that sort of wasted the team's time, they didn't maybe get as far as they should have, could have. And there's history of this happening all over ... And every single time because the doctors don't trust and they hate these minute clinics. Really just not good. It was difficult discussions, people returning to issues that were left, couldn't move on, not clear decision making on their end, and frankly, we didn't necessarily push them to make those decisions sometimes, so it's not all their fault. We have to take responsibility sometimes for not framing things in a way that the decision has to be made before you move on. They literally were like significant like statements like, `We can do this, we can deal with this later, but right now we just have to sort of work apart.` And then I actually intervened and facilitated a reconciliation before the end of the project that helped the team get back together and sort of acknowledge their tensions and the [inaudible 00:46:24] of their tensions and to move on and that did work. PROJECT ID `Well, we just have to make it more actionable, we have to do more prototyping around these very near term things that they can use right away.` And the other person said, `Screw that, that's not going to be valuable to them, we really need to do this.` And they disagreed on how to handle the response to the client. So they started- Right, it exacerbates it, so then it became a little bit of ... You know, personal style [inaudible 00:48:07] at this point because you're not, there's already some tension, there's some uneasiness, there's some anxiety, there's a client issue, and then a personal style thing can have more importance.   It turns out they just, they couldn't reconcile between the two of them. So in a sense it wasn't power as much as they both knew what's right, they were both very confident that what they thought was right.",

    "text": "Because I'm very critical and so for me to say a project completely clicked together is ... I haven't found one yet. Well, one that went really well the project leader knew he was going to have some stuff to build. He knew he wanted me to help lead that and so because the presentation of the deliverable was physical, let's say 75% physical, I thought it was smart of him to delegate. So, what he did was he said, `Look, we're got this big build, it's a major part. We've got some designs and some ideas. We don't have them completely solidified, but I want you to head up the build`, and then allowed me to take that and run with it how I wanted to and deal with those problems, which was smart for him because then that allowed him to focus on the big picture like what going on with the whole project, keeping the writers content, giving them the information they need, designers, and then the build. So, he brought me in early and said, `Look, this is big build. I need you to head this up and let me know what you need.` And I was able to say, `Look, this is what I need, this is when I need it. I need another person. This is who I want.` That person didn't work here and not that he didn't question me, but it wasn't like he was against me. And then he also trusted me with my job. I'm usually background. I do think it was a little questionable at the beginning, but after presenting the build in our work they were so excited about it that they went back and made a duplicate and tried it out. And I think we got, I want to say at least one more project out of it because they were so excited about the whole answer. I guess I keep coming back trust. If you have a project leader that can't trust you to do your job there's one of two problems. Either the project leader needs to sort himself out, or the person that's on the team shouldn't be trusted, and that needs to be addressed. More often than not, you end up with a lot of project leads that are mother henning everybody, and it doesn't allow the team to grow. If you get people on your team that you can trust and that you know have a good track record, you should let them do their job. If they're sitting there questioning you, like if I'm sitting in the shop. I'm building something, and someone comes up and goes, `Is that really how you want to make it?` Okay. Well, why don't you make it then, obviously since you're so much better at it? I have that problem every so often, and it drives me nuts because if they were so good at model building, then why don't they just do it themselves instead of sit there and give me a hassle about it. So, it could be like me going to a mechanical engineer and telling them they're not designing the mechanism right with the vectors and It's like come on. That's how you get a great project is by having your team do their jobs because then there's no overlap, so you can cover more area. You can go faster, and everybody's more content. `Look, we're got this big build, it's a major part. We've got some designs and some ideas. We don't have them completely solidified, but I want you to head up the build`, and then allowed me to take that and run with it how I wanted to and deal with those problems, which was smart for him because then that allowed him to focus on the big picture like what going on with the whole project, keeping the writers content, giving them the information they need, designers, and then the build. Justification, yeah. So, I was able to bring in the other person who I had 100% confidence in that I didn't have to babysit. And then he and I ... because this other guy, we complement each other well. So, I would say some of the key elements to why it worked so well was that he brought me in on the project leader, the project lead brought me in on the project early. He didn't wait until either things were screwed up or it was too late to get a good design. And then he also trusted me with my job. And so when he brought me on the project he didn't know exactly what these things were going to look like. And he's like, `Why don't you go off and we have a couple napkin sketches. Go make a few of these different shapes and come get me`, because there was cylinders that opened up. There were boxy looking ones. There was this nicer clam shell looking thing, but they all had to be able to collapse and they all had to have a nice feeling. And that way I didn't have to worry about that because I knew she was taking care of it, and then I was still working on walls and tents, which was nice because again, project lead allowed me to make that decision to have Liz. It wasn't a fight. It wasn't like why do you need ... Why can't you just do this also? Or it can't be that difficult. In fact, it was a pretty difficult problem in and of itself.   That's how you get a great project is by having your team do their jobs because then there's no overlap, so you can cover more area. You can go faster, and everybody's more content.",

    "text": "No, they cook the eggs there, which is ... I didn't know that either, but they do a lot of that. And it's like well, you guys hide everything, and you guys are so fast and efficient, and McDonald's is one of the most efficient fast-food places. They're way beyond anybody else as far as exploring how to be as efficient and simple as possible. So, this project was a build at the innovation center at McDonald's, and in theory, there was one project lead, but for some reason there seemed to be two different people trying to make the same decisions, trying to answer the same questions. So, I would go up to one of them and say, `How do you want this to look?` or `What are you thinking as far as getting this done or this?`, ask him a question. He would say one thing, and then the other person would come up and say, `Don't listen to him. Do it this way.` And, the one project leader, A, was constantly questioning me on how I was building things to the point where they actually made fun of a couple ways I built things. He would say one thing, and then the other person would come up and say, `Don't listen to him. Do it this way.` And, the one project leader, A, was constantly questioning me on how I was building things to the point where they actually made fun of a couple ways I built things. Which, then after it was built they realized why I did it that way, and in fact, the CEOs of McDonald's saw how I was doing it and thought it was incredibly smart because they didn't even know the direction of their design when I was building this, yet we had a deadline This one specific thing was that they wanted to have ... They wanted to do something like the counters more or less in a circular configuration, so if you imagine a round counter with multiple stations. And then above it, there was this header that was also echoing same size going around the top, and they wanted ... Well, they didn't know what they wanted because they were constantly arguing. One of them wanted to be able to project from a projector onto the surface of this facet, this façade, images. Then they wanted to project it from behind. Then they wanted to put stickers on it. Then they didn't want to do anything. And so oddly enough, my friend from California was also out for that project because he does a lot of stage design, so he and I were like how are you going to make something that either is going to get projected from the back, from the front, stickers on it? They don't know how far off the ground they want it, or far off the ceiling because they wanted it to float there. How are you going to solve all these problems and start building something because our deadline's in two weeks?  He's like, `What are you building?` I'm like I'm trying to explain it and just finally I was like, `You know what, fuck you.` This was in Romeoville, which is a two hour drive. It was costing me $15.00 in tolls. I was working probably 15 hours a day including Saturday. I didn't see my family. And then the other project lead B, she was saying, `Okay, well we need this set up and we need this and this particular configuration.` And she was giving my drawings down to a 16th of an inch for a 75 foot square environment. To a 16th of an inch ... Showed me a complete lack of any kind of intelligence. If you can get within a half a foot, and this is a prototype. It's not going to be used to actually process people. How is she going to measure from the center of a 22 foot diameter ring on the ceiling to the center down and then off of two walls to a 16th of an inch? You can do it, but it's a waste of time and completely unnecessary. That's where knowing what you should do and what you shouldn't do comes into play, learning where you should stop. And project lead B did not understand the tolerances. She didn't live in the real world. I'm like, `Are you serious? A 16th of an ... You know how much a 16th of an inch?` And she still didn't understand, so I basically lied. I'm just like, `Yep, let's do the 16th`, because there's no way she would have been able to measure it anyway. Yeah. It wasn't dealt with formally. I try to be extremely tolerant and understanding of people, so I try and give everybody a benefit of a doubt. I always ... They make a mistake, no big deal. We all make mistakes, but if you're constantly making mistakes and you're supposed to be a project lead there's something seriously wrong. Project leads make mistakes all the time. It's whether they admit it, whether they correct it are the strong attributes to being a good project lead. If a project lead doesn't make mistakes you're not looking close enough, and it's to be expected. Everybody makes mistakes. But as far as formally dealing with it, I don't know how they formally dealt with it. I tried to distance myself as much as possible. I try to be extremely tolerant and understanding of people, so I try and give everybody a benefit of a doubt. I always ... They make a mistake, no big deal. We all make mistakes, but if you're constantly making mistakes and you're supposed to be a project lead there's something seriously wrong. Project leads make mistakes all the time. It's whether they admit it, whether they correct it are the strong attributes to being a good project lead. If a project lead doesn't make mistakes you're not looking close enough, and it's to be expected. Everybody makes mistakes. Yeah. It wasn't dealt with formally. I couldn't even do my job because ... And they had unrealistic time schedules like, `Hey you can build this kitchen in, I don't know, two days. Is that alright?` And they wanted 2x4 frame member structure. And both Mike and I are like, `We build sets all the time.` We used to. I used to work in California building sets and models and stuff. I said, `You only need 1x3's or smaller because you're just skinning the stuff. It's just a picture. It's an experience that you can walk around. You can put a little weight on it for a cash register or whatever, but we're not designing the thing to actually be manufactured. That comes later on in a different phase if they actually were to take this and go with it. But that wasn't even a discussion. That wasn't even a part of it. You can put a little weight on it for a cash register or whatever, but we're not designing the thing to actually be manufactured. That comes later on in a different phase if they actually were to take this and go with it. But that wasn't even a discussion. That wasn't even a part of it. Yeah. We've worked with McDonald's quite a bit, so they knew us. They knew our quality. They knew our creativity and they like the way we innovate and come up with new ideas. So, it, I would say, it was probably not a risky project at all because they weren't going to implement it. Don't listen to him. Do it this way.` And, the one project leader, A, was constantly questioning me on how I was building things to the point where they actually made fun of a couple ways I built things. And, the one project leader, A, was constantly questioning me on how I was building things to the point where they actually made fun of a couple ways I built things Don't listen to him.

One of them wanted to be able to project from a projector onto the surface of this facet, this façade, images. And so, we went to the hardware store, and we're looking around. Well, maybe PVC. No, that's too flexible, blah blah blah, so we just tried thinking why don't we use copper pipe? Copper pipe we can solder together. We can make two tracks on the top. We can connect them with couplings in between, and then when they figure out where they either want to project from the front or the back, we can cut out the copper. We can move those joints. We can eliminate them, but once it's all screwed together, it should be a nice rigid yet light structure. Well, we started doing that, and we started bending the pipes and stuff, and we had stuff laid out. And one of the project leader A started laughing, saying that it looked like a train track. He's like, `What are you building?` I'm like I'm trying to explain it and just finally I was like, `You know what, fuck you.` Because I was just ... At that point because I had been working ... This was in Romeoville, which is a two hour drive. It was costing me $15.00 in tolls. I was working probably 15 hours a day including Saturday. I didn't see my family. The guy had no sympathy. And I was completely fed up with it. I was like I'm fighting the project leader so that I can do my job because I know how to do it. If he knew how to do it he should have done it, but nobody on the project team, the design team was actually designing anything. It was just a complete fiasco. How is she going to measure from the center of a 22 foot diameter ring on the ceiling to the center down and then off of two walls to a 16th of an inch? You can do it, but it's a waste of time and completely unnecessary. That's where knowing what you should do and what you shouldn't do comes into play, learning where you should stop.

You know how much a 16th of an inch?` And she still didn't understand, so I basically lied. I'm just like, `Yep, let's do the 16th`, because there's no way she would have been able to measure it anyway. Frustrating, yes. Yeah, no there was only one project lead, but between the two they couldn't design anything. They couldn't come up with an answer. I don't know how they formally dealt with it. I tried to distance myself as much as possible. I couldn't even do my job because ... And they had unrealistic time schedules like, `Hey you can build this kitchen in, I don't know, two days. Is that alright?` And they wanted 2x4 frame member structure. And both Mike and I are like, `We build sets all the time.` But he wouldn't listen, and we basically had to go behind his back, go to Home Depot, buy 1x because it was much easier to cut, much easier to nail together, much easier to change when design changes happened.   No, because McDonald's does a lot of projects like this where they're just experimental. I don't even think that they were even ... I don't even think in their mind that they were even going to use this idea no matter what we came up with. It was just an experience that they would have so that they could draw on it later on.",

I mean all the basics, but in reality they were ... what we came up with was to create different hairdos inspired by things you would see around you and this particular product helps you do that hairdo.

Yeah, and then we were in Concepcion and right outside of ... Oh God, it's all such a blur now. We were in so many different places. And then we were in Rio and Buenos Aires for some of the stuff we did indoor. The casting in Brazil is just phenomenal. These girls were just scary beautiful.

Everybody knew what they wanted it to be, in the very beginning. They were amazing. Really, really positive and really inspiring on both sides.   Just very ... They just get it. They understand the leaps you have to make, that you can't see everything finished before it's actually produced and were really good at understanding conceptual ideas. And really loved work. Just a very ... I don't know, it was just very ... It was just a lot of fun. Really good. Yeah, really, really good. I think there was one kind of internal conflict with a freelance writer, but she didn't last very long.

    "text": "A positive project would probably be I worked on Mexicali Beer. That's a brand of Coors, a few years ago. The reason it clicked so well is that it was fairly low budget as far as on the radar because it was Coors brand but it didn't get a whole lot of backing. What made the project click was the least amount of opinions went into it. We didn't have to run it up every single pole to get everybody's thought on it. Frankly, in my opinion of this whole business, that is the biggest killer of all creative is too many people in a room with too many opinions. That's probably the best one that I've had in my career, just because we had ideas, they were really funny, we got it through, we went and shot it, and they got on air without somebody going, `Hey, wait, wait, wait. I should not be doing this or this.` One main guy and that was the key, too. Really, only one, which was our Group Creative Director. Then we showed people down the road after it was produced at the higher levels and everybody liked it. Really, only one. Not very risky at all. At all. It was a struggle to get it sold, so we had to really push it in the meeting, but once it was sold everybody was on board. It was a leap for them in the sense that they didn't know how well it was going to work. On that brand? They're very good. They're still there and everybody's still pretty happy. They've been part of the agency for, I don't even know, 20 years. So, it's good. There was some trust in there, yeah. More so than most clients. It was great. I was working with the Art Director I work with now and we're good friends. That's always better when you're working with somebody you get along with. That's probably the best one that I've had in my career, just because we had ideas, they were really funny, we got it through, we went and shot it, and they got on air without somebody going, `Hey, wait, wait, wait. I should not be doing this or this.` That's probably the best one that I've had in my career, just because we had ideas, they were really funny, we got it through, we went and shot it, and they got on air without somebody going, `Hey, wait, wait, wait. I should not be doing this or this.` PROJECT ID As a matter of fact, let me go back on this. Where the idea came from was that the brief was so frickin' extensive and we had to say so many things that actually sparked the idea of what we did, which was spoofing these Mexican soap operas and having subtitles. The reason we had to have subtitles was because they wanted to say so many things that we couldn't get it all in the spot. It worked in the sense that they couldn't say it wasn't on strategy because every point that they had in their brief was subtitled. However, those time constraints usually help creatively a lot, because people don't have time to sit, and ponder, and `Well, I was looking at it with my husband and my kids over the weekend and they all thought ... `. Quote-unquote, you know? You don't get that. Time can usually be better for creative.   Good in the sense that they kind of listen to us and respect what the agency has to say. It isn't like, `No, no, this isn't what we were thinking, so go back and do it again.` `Oh, we never thought of it that way, so we'll try it.` You know what I mean?",

    "text": "This one was a great idea that everybody was super excited about. It was really, really funny and it was really big for the brand. Had to do all kinds of crazy testing, of course. Got through all the test results, but the one thing that was a little high ... This is on Kraft and we ended up losing Kraft soon after this. I think there were a lot of factors at play that were beyond what we were doing here, because the whole company went to another agency, which was huge. Get the test results and there was a little bit of negative results in the sense that some people within the segment of target that liked it, found it a little offensive. I think we hurt it internally in the sense that the guy we had running the place I don't think sold it hard enough. I don't think the relationships with who we had in place that were supposed to be the people in contact with Kraft, there was not trust there at all. I don't even know if there was any like there, quite frankly. They didn't listen to each other. They didn't care what we had to say. This happens quite a bit. One person at Kraft blew up and ruined the whole thing. One person at Kraft blew up and ruined the whole thing. Not really, because we went and presented a bunch of ideas, but this one completely rose to the top. Everybody was super excited about this one, including her, the lady who demolished it. Not really, because we went and presented a bunch of ideas, but this one completely rose to the top. Everybody was super excited about this one, including her, the lady who demolished it. Like I said, it may have been more political in the sense that the upper levels were the ones who were moving agencies. They may have known that and it may have been a part of it, I don't know. One, two, three, four, I would say five. Three out of the those five had a lot to say on a daily basis, one had the overall say when it was all said and done. We dealt with massive, massive amounts of comments. They would not let it go. It was horrible. It was a horrible time. That's all right. I'm still pissed off about it, actually. No, it wasn't. They actually had money and we had enough time to test it 10 times. There were ugly phone calls and ugly messages, so they weren't getting along. I have to admit, from an agency standpoint, we tried to stand up for ourselves and say, `Look, this is a brilliant idea, you guys have to do this.` I felt tension between it in meetings.  I think, quite frankly, all three of them are super smart people and did a great job here, but I think from an ego standpoint, somebody failed to realize that the relationship was more important than them having to swing around saying, `I'm the President,` or whatever. I think they should've put somebody in place that was a little more Midwestern to get along with them. Everybody was just trying to get this thing sold, together. Everybody was doing everything they possible could on every angle to try and get this sold. It just didn't happen. The idea was just my partner and I's, but then we have our creative director who was also trying to sell it, and the President, and the head account people all trying to help sell it. Yeah, it got all the scores we needed to get. It just had a little higher level of possible dislike. It was negative because of some sort of annoying. It could possibly annoy. It was [anamatics 00:18:13] and this guy was kind of screaming around. It could've been anything that brought that up. They just couldn't get over it. We tried to tell them, `Look, once we shoot this with live people they're going to be more likable. It's facial expressions.` This is on Kraft and we ended up losing Kraft soon after this. I think there were a lot of factors at play that were beyond what we were doing here, because the whole company went to another agency, which was huge. Get the test results and there was a little bit of negative results in the sense that some people within the segment of target that liked it, found it a little offensive. The client was super scared to go out there with something that could be at all offensive. It was this Evangelist guy that was doing miracles with Miracle Whip. She thought that some people were going to be offended, so we were changing it. We did everything we could to keep it alive. Months and months of changes, and redos, and all that shit. Eventually, it just went away and we lost the business. I think we hurt it internally in the sense that the guy we had running the place I don't think sold it hard enough. I don't think the relationships with who we had in place that were supposed to be the people in contact with Kraft, there was not trust there at all. I don't even know if there was any like there, quite frankly. They didn't listen to each other. They didn't care what we had to say. This happens quite a bit. On person at Kraft blew up and ruined the whole thing. She's the one who said, `No.` She was the one who made the final decision. The people underneath her loved the idea, wanted to go forward, she said, `No, I'm not going to do it.` Like I said, it may have been more political in the sense that the upper levels were the ones who were moving agencies. They may have known that and it may have been a part of it, I don't know. Yeah, right. In theory, it was huge. Miracle Whip's a pretty big brand and it's been around for a long time. They were looking to revamp it and what they ended up doing was just horrible shit. They weren't good. There was actually not a whole lot of trust. People really weren't getting along, quite frankly. It got ugly every now and then. There were ugly phone calls and ugly messages, so they weren't getting along. I have to admit, from an agency standpoint, we tried to stand up for ourselves and say, `Look, this is a brilliant idea, you guys have to do this.` Then that got out of hand and I think it was because the lack of trust and maybe even the lack of like with the people who were running the show for here then. Kraft, we were working with was a very Midwest company and they were very Midwest people. We were completely run by British people. I know it sounds like biased, but I think there was tension between that.   The fact is, there wasn't any Americans in the room. Everybody who was ever in the room selling it, we had an English account person, an English head creative, and an English head President. I think, quite frankly, all three of them are super smart people and did a great job here, but I think from an ego standpoint, somebody failed to realize that the relationship was more important than them having to swing around saying, `I'm the President,` or whatever. I think they should've put somebody in place that was a little more Midwestern to get along with them.",

    "text": "Excellent. They wanted to laugh. When we came in it was less about oh my god did they hit these three points that I wanted to and more about are we making them laugh? Their first reaction was so critical to them, like wow, I'm responding to this as a person, not as a brand manager with my strategic hat on. So if we made them laugh, and I'm happy to say when we presented the work to them most of the time we would make them cry with laughter. I mean, if we were really getting them to howl we knew we had a winner, because if we can get you to laugh, we know we're gonna get hopefully the same response from our audience, because it's funny stuff and yes we can tweak it strategically, but it's hard to grab them and get that honest emotion from them that is almost really not a thought process. It's more instinct or gut as opposed to so much over thinking the brain. And it just all kind of fell into place where we could be a little bit outrageous with them. They're teenagers and college students who like wicked fun anyway, and so we could be a little bit more edgy with them. Everybody kind of understood that and accepted that, and it really came together and they said for the like eight years that we had that account that we always they felt hit it out of the park, because we were so in sync with our target, the mindset, the goals of wanting to be entertaining and make the advertising seem as entertaining to them as game playing. So it really went hand in hand like gosh, if they're that entertaining on television, they must really get me as a consumer, so I'll give them my business. I think it was one of those kinds of perfect connections that worked out very well. It was essentially three. Two people who were in charge of the marketing and then their direct boss, and that was really it, and that helped a lot just having the two people who were really in sync and always together on stuff and always in the room together at the same time. I think when you play that protocol game and have to do, well we have to show this person first, then we have to go up the ladder to this person, I really think if you can get everybody in the same room at the same time, and the great thing about it is our boss when we first presented the work to these people, they were always in the same room together. So really even though the one person then wasn't maybe as involved in the details as the head guy, he was still there on the ground floor when it came up. So everybody was like I like this, this is good, let's continue with this. Show me what I need to as details arrive on a need to know basis, but essentially you're getting them all in on the ground floor with a big idea. And then from there on the details probably fall into the hands of the people who need to handle those specific details. So it was really good. I think the more people are in on the ground floor the better. Because they're all a part of that decision from the get go as opposed to you spend months and months developing this idea and you show your boss and he goes eh. Then you've wasted three months. What good is that? Well, there was basically me and then my boss, who was the executive creative director. So that was two on the teams that we worked on, me first and then we would take it all together to the executive creative director, and he had the final word. So again, really only two layers there, which was good too. The less layers the better. There's the big bowl of letters. As a creative director I usually try to not have multiple teams working on it. I think it's sometimes better with ownership. So it was usually one team, but sometimes it was two. But they all had ownership of what they were doing on it then and like the team that came up with the big idea, then really sort of saw it through and that was kind of their baby through all different pieces of it. And then there were other partners who did some things online and promotions and stuff like that, but they were really kind of the team that was involved with all that, because it was their idea and they got to take it into all those different channels. Very willing to take risks. They didn't test. They went with their gut. They were willing to be edgy. They didn't want to do anything that was gonna be sexist or racist, but they were willing to do other, edgier jokes. Whether it was somebody who was acting bipolar or parroting the lethargy of people sitting down and playing video games or even the acne kind of teen crowd. Any of that, anything goes with that. They were willing to laugh at that. Because they know that that's what the audience laughs at. So they could do it and not feel like oh my gosh, is it okay to make fun of somebody's pimples? It's like yes, this audience would laugh at that. Yes, there are some people out there who have bad acne and they probably won't laugh, but the majority of people will. So yeah, they're very risky. Very useful, yep. I think the brief means everything. I think as much as we say the creative is king, of course it is. An agency's reputation rests on that. But I don't think you can really do very good creative without a really good brief that's clear, concise, simple and tells you exactly what you're trying to say. No, again we had quite a bit of time. Because they didn't have testing they eliminated sort of the panic out of it. A lot of times when you work in an encounter to include testing, there's always the one schedule says okay, if we get the great scores and we go into production we're right on schedule. But then there's the old well, if we don't get the good scores, then we're up against the wall a little bit and we have to sort of scramble to make sure we can still make the deadline and the air dates, even though we're got to sort of reinvent the wheel by creating new work and stuff. So eliminating testing helps I think. You also know too that it's up to the two people then to say I feel it's good. The people who know the business, Blockbuster, and the people who know the marketing, JWT. As opposed to okay, we're gonna show you a pseudo commercial that's animatic, drawings with a voice over track, this tremendously unreal environment where you're looking at it in some sort of test format and then tell me what you think of that. I don't think it's a real situation. I don't think people know how to respond to that. It immediately feels negativity, because it's not real and it's not a real environment. It's not how people actually consume those communications. I can't think of one other profession that puts out the pseudo version of it for you to judge the entire enchilada on. If I write a play and I want to try out this play, I've gotta do some rehearsals, cast it, put it out there on a stage and have some test audiences come and see it. With a movie maybe I don't get all the millions of dollars of special effects in, but when I do a test screening to see how it plays, it's 90% done. Even a sitcom has to shoot the pilot before you can judge it. It sounds like we say okay, we've got a great idea for a new sitcom, and here's the script we'd like you to read or here's the storyboard of how it actually looks. Now imagine these would be real actors who will be sitting there talking. You'll have great production. Huh? But advertisers when they test are sort of taking a very cheap and artificial track because we don't get to go out and shoot our commercial. And ours isn't as expensive as putting on a play or a sitcom pilot is a million dollars. A million dollars for half an hour. It just is. All the stars cost. A commercial, $300,000. And they don't wanna spend that, so they wanna spend only $20,000 on an animatic that sort of gives you the idea of the commercial via a film storyboard. It's kind of absurd. Or imagine this chair is really plush and soft. Would you want to buy that chair? I haven't sat in that chair. I don't even know what it is. I'm just enjoying a drawing of it or something. there's one thing you want to have fun at it, maybe you want to get good at it or beat your friends or whatever, but it's really just entertainment. So somehow working on that with the client and with people in the agency, going into something that's immediately just for fun and entertainment, I think lightened everybody's take on it some. So we wanted to have more fun with it and I think we wanted to be entertaining with the work we did to get that across and Blockbuster was wanting to appeal to the gamer and show that they had all these games. We didn't test stuff. I think we just kind of trusted our guts as marketing people and also understanding the target. here's one thing you want to have fun at it, maybe you want to get good at it or beat your friends or whatever, but it's really just entertainment.

But they all had ownership of what they were doing on it then and like the team that came up with the big idea, then really sort of saw it through and that was kind of their baby through all different pieces of it. It was really simple. It was to engage the gamer, Blockbuster gets them and has everything they would need. And I think that directly led to us being able to be edgy and clever by saying hey, if they get me and they know that I've got this smart alecky kind of everything's a game, I love to just screw around with this kind of world, if we can reflect that in how we communicate it to them they'd say oh wow, that's kind of my mindset or that's the kind of stuff that blows my skirt up. They get me and gosh, if they've got all the selection too, why won't I go there? As opposed to just we've got games and therefore rentals for $10.99. Maybe. Maybe the economy of that is persuasive, but I think getting into their mindset is better first, and they were willing to do that.  I don't think people know how to respond to that. It immediately feels negativity, because it's not real and it's not a real environment. It's not how people actually consume those communications.   So I think if you eliminate that it's already gonna be much more positive. Because you're dealing with only really positive things trying to get the good out of it. That way you're always ready for the worst case scenario, and I think that's a wet blanket always. Some marketers would say well, then you know it's really resonating with the consumer. Well, I say bullshit to that because again, here's the other thing that is weird about our profession as advertisers. Even a sitcom has to shoot the pilot before you can judge it. It sounds like we say okay, we've got a great idea for a new sitcom, and here's the script we'd like you to read or here's the storyboard of how it actually looks. Now imagine these would be real actors who will be sitting there talking. You'll have great production. It's the worst part of our business, I think. And I think it sometimes is the one thing that keeps us from being great. I said good to great and time is the difference there, I think that kind of stuff, it's a buzz kill and it takes up time that doesn't give you the time to really make the commercial work better, so you're always kind of running and gunning like having to put that into the schedule and react to that and fix things quickly. It's, I think it's probably the worst thing in our business is that kind of stuff. If they wanna test it fine, but test a real commercial, put it on TV and see how it plays. That's right. And here's the funny paradox of it or the catch 22, is you're entirely right. They don't. However, with DVD extras that show you how things are done, and we know how special effects are done, we know how they do things, that analogy has actually made it worse for us, because now when people look at our stuff they go `that's the cheapest animation I've ever seen, it looks terrible, that doesn't look real.` It's like `it's not.` It's not going to be real. [crosstalk 00:34:18]. But I think that outsider thing allowed us to speak even more directly to them as members of the club. Like, we get it. Like our kind of smart alecky attitude in the advertising reflected their kind of smart alecky like hey, I know this is cool but I know a lot of people don't get it, including my folks. So I'm a little bit of a maverick or I'm a little bit out there as well, and wow, that allowed us to even speak their language more a little bit. Because it really wasn't mainstream. It was a little bit on the fringe, and I think our work and our mindset approaching it sort of took that attitude and ran with it. Excellent. They wanted to laugh. When we came in it was less about oh my god did they hit these three points that I wanted to and more about are we making them laugh? Their first reaction was so critical to them, like wow, I'm responding to this as a person, not as a brand manager with my strategic hat on. So if we made them laugh, and I'm happy to say when we presented the work to them most of the time we would make them cry with laughter. Very good. Again, I think it was all very positive because the people who worked on it were gamers and I'm a gamer and the audience, we were the audience. I think that helped. I don't think you always have to have it, but if you do it's even better.",

    "text": "The agency will do the TV and print and have the big idea, but everybody else will do their own part of it. You give 10 different creative people 10 different things to do and they're all gonna wanna make it as much theirs as possible, and it doesn't always fit with the vision of the overall arching idea. So arguably the first year of that idea, while it was a huge idea, it turned into a little bit of a Tower of Babel where you had different people speaking in different languages all trying to build this idea up, but not really communicating with each other as much, doing their own separate thing because they are being paid to go off and do their own separate thing. And it just didn't gel as much. It didn't seem as cohesive an idea as possible. On the client side it was not too many, like three or four layers, but they were all pretty cohesive and tied together. But it was all the disparate parts of it. They all had to see and judge. So there were too many players and too many things coming at them from different angles, I think made it harder for them to make it all as cohesive judgment as well, even though arguably those three or four layers were fairly closely aligned and tight.   Again, it was like the creative team and then the executive creative director, so it was pretty tight. We were very much aligned on our side, but we couldn't control the other stuff, the other partners. We could tell them what we thought they should do, but they weren't contractually obligated to do any of that. They only had to answer to the brand manager, who was Nestle, and while the brand manager was pretty good, I think those were decisions that would have better been served with one creative head on it who was qualified and expert in that area to help guide them on it as opposed to him sort of having to become a quick study on all things creative in seven or eight different capacities which nobody, I've been a creative director for a long time, I'm not an expert at everything on the internet. They were very willing to take risk on that, which was great. They knew that for this target they had to be edgy and they were willing to be edgy. They did. And a lot of it did very well, but some of it didn't, like a lot of the other partners, you can't really research a PR idea. Or some viral things and some of that kind of stuff. So while some of that was good, it didn't all seem part of the same idea sometimes. It seemed very disparate. But yeah, they did test all that, which is good, but I think it also maybe, again not being all part of one campaign that was pulled together and maybe looked at or tested might have hurt it in some ways. It was a very good brief. We wanted to make connect with our target more and be clever and connect with humor in the fun way the brand always does, and so this icon, which was sort of representing the brand, is gonna become the authority on fun the way  is sort of the fun candy bar, this kind of quirky, offbeat humor kind of way, which was what the finger was always gonna point to was soft of offbeat humor that very much was in the brand character. It was a very good brief. But many people interpreted it different ways and it wasn't necessarily all coming from one sort of vision. But the finger was orange. So it was the finger. And it was this kind of hand that would point to funny things. Butterfinger has this reputation as being a sort of funny and odd candy bar, and this was this funny and odd sort of icon to represent it, not dissimilar to the way that the king sort of represents Burger King. They have the logo with the hamburger, but somebody, here's this odd king character which is also the name of the chain. So arguably the first year of that idea, while it was a huge idea, it turned into a little bit of a Tower of Babel where you had different people speaking in different languages all trying to build this idea up, but not really communicating with each other as much, doing their own separate thing because they are being paid to go off and do their own separate thing. And it just didn't gel as much. It didn't seem as cohesive an idea as possible. And I think that sort of getting back to how many layers were there, how many people were there, there were too many participants, too many layers. I think the tighter focus you have on any creativity the better. And that was one of those examples where too many cooks in the kitchen. So there were too many players and too many things coming at them from different angles, I think made it harder for them to make it all as cohesive judgment as well, even though arguably those three or four layers were fairly closely aligned and tight. PROJECT ID But he was certainly asked to be an expert on creative, and things on the internet, things in PR, not his skill set. So it was difficult for him I think as well. Even within the guidelines. Nestle's a fairly conservative company and they've got guidelines and sort of principles that they want to adhere to that aren't too out there, but they were willing to really be as edgy as they can get. We were considered to be the edgiest work they'd ever done in that division probably.",

    "text": "Okay, let me think. Because we've worked on a number of projects like this, that have been ... Because see, I could put this in both categories. As far as not going so well, I mean there have been a number of occasions where we're given the ... well, not the smallest of tasks, but a task that it would seem that you would not need a full creative team to work on. And then you have to deliver in a very short amount of time. And sadly, you never get to deliver what you want to deliver because you go into knowing that there's no time and nobody really cares about the outcome. So I can't put my finger on a specific project, there have just been a number of tiny disappointments along the way that were ... That was the common theme, which was, `We don't have much time for this. We just need to get it out by Friday. Here's what we want, just give us your ideas.` And they kind of buy your first idea and just walk away with it. And you know it's not your best work. So that's I think ... Like I said, I can't put my finger on a single project. I'm trying to remember. I honestly ... I've worked here for eight years, and I've probably worked on 15 or 20 different clients. And it's not like ... Like on the television side, they'll have a lot of time to work on stuff. But for instance, we work on the Illinois Bureau of Tourism. In that brand, I'll have maybe 15 different projects going on. Of those 15 projects, five of them are probably important, and ten of them are, `The client needs to see this kind of maintenance.` It's like, `We don't ... that should go to the web development people.` `No, no, no, but we need you guys to go find a picture.` We find a picture. `We hate that picture.` `Okay, I'm sorry that you hate it. This is what we've got.` `Well, we need another picture.` `Well, we need a budget to shoot it.` `No, you can't have that, just find something else.` And so you end op finding a piece of stock that everybody sort of sighs over and says, `All right, fine.` And it goes up on the website. And no one's really ever happy with it. So we can use that. We can use image finding for Illinois Tourism. For their three-day getaway site, if you need a specific ... See, this is really uncomfortable because it's like, `I don't want to talk about these things.` Not a lot to do here. So literally from year to year, the same things come up. But we have to develop 20 new ones every time, every quarter. And we have no budget to shoot photos, and we have to develop these itineraries with photography that matches them. So every season we're forced to ... No, well, that they never give it to the new guy. Get [inaudible 00:30:40] new guys. It's the State of Illinois Tourism, so it's ... a millions of dollar client. A lot of, `Here, take 50 bucks and go buy me an ice cream cone.` Good, I think. Probably medium. I think they allow us to push the boundaries. We've worked really hard as an agency before the digital team. The agency has established a brand for them, so we tend to push them more towards their own brand, I think. Sometimes they're ready to do one-offs and they need direction. Hell, they'll do anything to increase tourism. So it's like well, in that sense I think they're great risk takers but sometimes it's not always in the right direction, so ... but I think their risk tolerance is pretty good. It can. It absolutely can. And that's based on the whimsy if one of the client's, one of the three decision makers' has a tendency to shift that brief often. Time's always tight, budget's always tight. Oh, I thought you said usually, sorry. Yeah, I think it is, and it's because the way they perceive digital. For instance, photo budgets for the regular photo shoots. If they were to produce one print ad might be in the hundred thousand dollar range, we may be given five thousand for the entire season. So yeah, I think it's unusually small. No, we hand them the getaways, and then they whittle them away. I mean literally, that's what we do. Excellent. Excellent. It's the best client we've worked with. I don't think we could survive a project like this if we didn't have a really great relationship with them. Well, the negative is is that never get a chance to do it the right way. It's literally shoved into a template. I mean, if you want the negatives of this is that ... and it's ironic, it's really interesting. And I'm just seeing this now. One of our worst relationships produced one of our best products, in my mind, and one of our better relationships produces sort of a milk toast, it never really works product to me, because we tend to do it over and over again. I think the repetition of this product and the time frame never allow us to push the boundaries of what this should be, all right? There's a form, and it's templated and we do sort of the same things over and over again, and it's easy. Not that it's hard, but I think it ... creatively it's unrewarding because we never have a chance to push beyond the boundary of what that defined line is.  At the third month point, really at the first month of those three months, whenever we write off on it and go, `We're done.` And we're working on other projects. And in the past, that process didn't occur until much later, until you're really close to when you had to deliver again and then suddenly you're doing the exact same thing you just fought three months ago. At the third month point, really at the first month of those three months, whenever we write off on it and go, `We're done.` And we're working on other projects. And in the past, that process didn't occur until much later, until you're really close to when you had to deliver again and then suddenly you're doing the exact same thing you just fought three months ago. .

So that's I think ... Like I said, I can't put my finger on a single project. `We don't ... that should go to the web development people.` `No, no, no, but we need you guys to go find a picture.` We find a picture. `We hate that picture.` `Okay, I'm sorry that you hate it.

See, this is really uncomfortable because it's like, `I don't want to talk about these things.` Because it's like, you don't really want to talk about those things. My failures. Three. It's actually, it's a team of three, so we can usually get two of them. But there's really one major player. As long as we can get the other two to just talk to her, we can get things passed. They're an easy client to satisfy. It's not so much that the brief changes, it's just that whatever was briefed ... It's not that the brief changes, it's that they make requests that aren't driven by the brief and no one fights them on it. Again, we have to go ... I think this one of those things that you have to find new ways to frame what's already there. So often the source of inspiration is just going to a travel writer that we use, getting her ideas, and then all of us get together and try to spin a new direction for it. So ... That even though they don't always buy what we sell them, and that they will fight for things, we are friends at the end of the day. There's never a challenge so strong that we would jeopardize our business with them. And I think the business relationship's good and I think the respect is good enough that they ... even though we have an extremely opinionated decision maker, she will occasionally buckle and let us have our way because we do the same. I mean, it's very give and take relationship. There are times that we go, `You know, it's not worth fighting. Yeah, she can have that image. Fine. We don't feel like it solves that problem, but fine, she can have it.` There are other times when I have to call her and say, `Hey, you know there's, here's my problem with what you're asking.` And once you explain yourself, she'll go, ` Oh. Oh, okay. Fine.` So it's a lot ... they are willing to listen. They're very opinionated, but they're willing to listen. And I think that's unique among lots of clients, unfortunately.  There's a form, and it's templated and we do sort of the same things over and over again, and it's easy. Not that it's hard, but I think it ... creatively it's unrewarding because we never have a chance to push beyond the boundary of what that defined line is.   First of all, you change the way it looks on the page. If you look at them, you'll see that they are extremely dry, extremely long, they're informative but there needs to be abetter way to engage that information. There's a lot of information, but I think the interaction with that information is extremely passive and we need to activate that. It needs to be ... people need to be excited about going there, and go, `Ooh, ooh, look at this. We need to ... Oh, look what we can do. Oh, I can ...` They need to be more engaged with the content. The content's there, it's great. Tons of content, zero engagement levels. Nothing for it, so that's bad. That's bad in my mind.",

    "text": "I mean think there's ... Well, can I talk in a more broad nature? Well, okay. Yeah, you know what? We'll talk about Drumstick, which is ... We had a website which was an extremely challenging one. And the reason that it ... I feel that it clicked and came together was because we ... It was a horrible process. The client wasn't happy with things, the briefs were unclear, our process was miserable, worked late, it really drained a lot of our energy to do the project. But, I had an art director that was extremely passionate about what he wanted to deliver. I was directing animation, creative directing the project and I knew where we needed to take it based on what the client said they wanted and what they would comment on and what they had asked for originally. We had to constantly push back and say, `Look, you really said you wanted this and we're delivering this for you.` So it was an uphill battle. Our programmer basically quit over the project, so it sounds like it was a shambles, it sounds like it was a nightmare. But in the end, we just won two awards for it this year. It's gotten greater success than anything else for this client. It was very satisfying to know that by sticking to what we understood to be our process of delivery, by being true to sort of our gut check, our internal feeling on `This is the right thing to be doing,` ... The way the project clicked for me was once we launched, once we got response, once we got awards, it was like we were right. In fact, it validated our suffering. And I think having your suffering validated sometimes is more important than not suffering. I think the suffering is always going to be there in creative work. I've had friends who are screenwriters and they go through the same thing. It's the validation along the line, either by their peers, award shows, money, whatever it is that validates you, that validation helps cement the reasons to make those choices again in the future. And I think that was ... I liked that project for that reason. Another project that we had, a similar project was a little website that we had to create in a very short amount of time. But we were given sort of free reign. The client fought us, they hated it, they didn't understand it. It was basically for teens, it was a video game product for teens. And they were like, `We don't get this.` It's like, `Great. That pleases us. You shouldn't get this. This is for them. You've asked us to deliver` ... They said, ` Well, this is only going to stay up for three weeks.` It was up for almost five months. So they literally left it, they left it in place. Not because it was unsuccessful, not because it was easy, but because it succeeded for them very well. So those sorts of projects are exciting to me. See, our budgets for digital, you would ... are probably laughable. Because they're always under a half million dollars and they're usually in the 50 to 100 thousand dollar range. So we're always working the very low margin comparatively, but- Oh god. Probably six. Four to six. We had a lot of layers of approval. Oh, account level manager, like account managers, brand managers, very low to mid-level account people. And the final decision maker actually really liked our work, but navigating that stream- ... yeah, the politics of that were just horrible. Yeah, absolutely they do. They demand a lot of proof. And I don't if that's just ... I think a lot of it is because they don't understand the medium yet. Television's an easy medium for them. They've done it for years and years and years. Print's an easy medium. Digital's a very new medium, so ... Because we live in it every day and we're familiar with it, they don't. They go to their Yahoo! Website, or their email, or they'll talk to their mom about what their mom likes. But it's really not the space that they're asking us to engage in, so ... Oh, I though of another project that was even better than that one. Well, it was just MySpace for the Marine Corps, it's the first time we ever did anything for the Marine Corps. Very low on the production scale, very little to have to do, very little art direction, but the idea was huge. It was such a big idea which was to connect with kids who wanted to be in the Marine Corps, connected them on MySpace. And the Marine Corps is very, not stodgy, they're very stoic and the have these paths that they have to travel down, and these values. So MySpace absolutely was not that. And we sold them off on being in that space and it was extremely successful. It was a huge project. I was very proud to be a part of that one. But as far as scope, this scope was extremely low. The return was huge. Muddled, I would think. I mean, it really was. Like I said, it started with, `We want a commercial website. We want a commercial website that will sell ice cream out of here. We want a commercial website that will sell ice cream out of here but we need to wrap it around a baseball promotion. Oh, by the way, we've only gotten this one guy and he's not ... just go, you guys can make that happen.` I think part of it was just that sort of whimsical style of art, and it was that my group creative director, our main boss, was a huge baseball fan. And then we all loved the product, so that didn't hurt at all. Knowing that we were able to pick up Drumstick and eat it and go, `Yeah, I remember when I had a Drumstick. And yeah, that's what would be fun.` There was a lot of collaboration on that one and I think that helped a lot. From our account people. We had very ... yeah. The account people to account people was a strained relationship. But we had very little face time with that client. Which is interesting because we normally have more face time with a client. Mm-hmm (affirmative), three getaways. About the previous project we were talking about, the Drumstick project. There was never, ever a debrief over that. And we begged for it, we cried for it, we screamed for it. We never got one. And that's like ... not having a debrief over a project, I think is tragic. Absolutely tragic. Debriefs are so important to help assess- The client wasn't happy with things, the briefs were unclear, our process was miserable, worked late, it really drained a lot of our energy to do the project. But, I had an art director that was extremely passionate about what he wanted to deliver. So it was an uphill battle. Our programmer basically quit over the project, so it sounds like it was a shambles, it sounds like it was a nightmare. But in the end, we just won two awards for it this year.

And I think that was ... I liked that project for that reason. We had to constantly push back and say, `Look, you really said you wanted this and we're delivering this for you.` Well, that was cool. And then the website for them was a failure because they ... the people that they gave it to did not understand what they were doing. There was huge disconnect for the brand. Very sad. Well, and the idea of the website was ... I don't know, I'll give you the two second version ... the idea of the website was that people were not eating Drumstick outside of summer, so they wanted them to eat Drumstick some other time of year. So we created a place called Summerville, but then this all had to be wrapped around a baseball promotion. So they complained that people aren't eating it, yet they're promoting in the spring, right before summer. So we wrapped this baseball promotion in a place called Summerville, and it was a pixel art ... They do a lot of pixel art in British advertising too. The little teeny guys, pixel guys. So we created this pixel art world where things moved around and it was kind of goofy and you could stroll around- In the scope of a project like this, it really should have been sort of a microsite or promotional site, and it took up a grand amount of time. It ate into lots of resources and time. Print's an easy medium. Digital's a very new medium, so ... Because we live in it every day and we're familiar with it, they don't. They go to their Yahoo! Website, or their email, or they'll talk to their mom about what their mom likes. But it's really not the space that they're asking us to engage in, so ...

It was such a big idea which was to connect with kids who wanted to be in the Marine Corps, connected them on MySpace. And the Marine Corps is very, not stodgy, they're very stoic and the have these paths that they have to travel down, and these values. Ironically, they screamed about budget. No, I think it might have been on par with what they typically spent. But they complained about overages, which were less ... in the tens of thousands of dollars. It was really, in the grand scheme of the company and of the return on investment, it was tiny. Very, very tiny. Horrible. Absolutely insane. But that's, again, that's a digital thing I think. Because I talked to- No, in this case it was extremely negative. We had very little time, well, production time I should say, sorry. Concepting time was decent, production time was atrocious, so ... Strained. Well, see, from a creative side, we had very little contact with the client. It was just our own account side. But I mean from their description, it seemed strained. We had- Oh, very negative I think. Because we weren't selling our own ideas. We were sort of passing them off and saying, `Please god, don't drown my babies.` And they go, `Oh, I'm sorry. We've drowned your babies.` You'll need to make another one. Awesome. Great. I mean, we would never have survived if we did just love each other. We all got along splendid.   I mean, we ... At our worst hour, at midnight or two in the morning when we're all ... the programmer's near tears and the art director hates everyone, we're laughing it up and going, `Yeah, we're going to finish this because we know we can do it.` There was just a sense of comradery. I think the common enemy ... there was no enemy among us, so the common enemy became the project and we just fought against it. We were like, `We're going to win this.`",

    "text": "What worked about it was the fact that we were able to effect the plan and we were able to effect the strategy and actually talk about things before the brief was locked down entirely. We got to set a lot of what the rules are overall, which really helped. It's like when you can get that sort of point and point of view to a client, which the planners, sometimes they get there, sometimes they don't, but it's like when you can get that sort of view in before the strategy is made, then when you show them the work, it's already there because you already have them in the mindset that you are before you started. It seems like those are always the biggest fights and the hardest ones to win, is when they're in a different mindset than you are and you're trying to find what the client's mindset is. We got to flatten that, which was good. We'd go through one round, and all the decision-makers were in the room. That always made it a lot easier because yeah, definitely if you have to go through multiple rounds and you don't get to be at the later presentation rounds, then a lot of times you're depending on some number-cruncher, brand guy's presentation skills to present something. When you're counting on logic- based people to talk about emotional-based stuff, which is what you really try to have your advertising be, you always feel like you're getting thrown off a cliff. It's like you don't know what's at the bottom. It might be something soft. It could be very pointy. Yeah, it was great because at that point you're setting the rules. Again, it's like as they were developing ... Because they were sort of developing the official paper brief that the client got, after they told us that, we got to influence that. We started showing stuff that was working as they were concurrently working on the brief so that all the paperwork could go through. We helped shaped the brief, we helped shape the thinking so that when everything finally did go through, it's like everything was what we said it was going to be. And with a client, I mean honestly yes, they want to be surprised and they want to be entertained, but one backbone of them is they want it to be everything that you said it was going to be in the first place, which is kind of a funny dichotomy. It's like they want to be surprised, but they don't want to be surprised. I think really what it is is they don't want to have to rationalize why it fits with what they asked you for. They want to just be able to see why it fits with what they asked for. They just want to be surprised as to what it actually is. Time, at the beginning, was incredibly short. We didn't have good timelines on the front. I think we had a week and a half to put the whole thing together, at most. I think truthfully it was like ... After we really got rolling on it, we probably had about four days, so it was an incredibly tight timeline, which I don't think that's a bad thing necessarily. They basically pushed us off of other projects for the four really intense days to work on that, but it all worked out okay. Yeah, budget was fine. I mean it wasn't overwhelmingly good, it wasn't overwhelmingly ba On this, it was one because there was such a short timeframe. Basically it said, `This is where we want to go,` and we brought in a bunch of stuff to our ECD on that and said, `Here's what it is. Here's how you do it. Here's all the elements.` I mean he was like, `Wow.` That was more than he was expecting us to be able to get out of it, and so they just took it and ... I mean everything was in trouble at that point, so it was like this was either going to work for the agency or it was all going to blow up, and so we took the risk that it was going to work and it worked. It was just the brand was doing badly and we had gone through an entire executive switchover here, so we had a new ECD and a fairly new president. I mean this client as a whole ... This is my opinion on this. This client, every time we had gotten a new executive set in, they would say, `Oh, maybe we should put you in review,` and they would just run them through the gauntlet to see what they would do, and so we were at one of those points again [crosstalk 00:31:15] No, they just threatened account- ... review. Yeah, they would threaten account review, but not actually put us on account review. And they would do that every time we had new executives come in at JWT, and so we were in that situation. On their side, the client ... The reality is that most agencies have more brand experience on the individual brand than any of the clients do because they rotate off in a year and a half. I had a six-year stretch on Oscar Mayer. I saw five teams. I knew the brand history better than any of the brand managers that came into the room. But it was ... Our executive team at JWT had shifted, so Oscar Mayer was putting us under heat. I was friends with the account guys pretty well, and I like the planning team. I hadn't worked with them much. I mean I had worked with the account team in one way or another off and on for a few years, just on various businesses within the agency, so it was all good. They trusted us, which trust helps no matter what you're working on, no matter what you're doing in life. What worked about it was the fact that we were able to effect the plan and we were able to effect the strategy and actually talk about things before the brief was locked down entirely. We got to set a lot of what the rules are overall, which really helped. PROJECT ID With the client. And part of it was the client was willing to dismiss all their preconceived notions because the brand was failing. It was failing in a big way. It was like on a five-year decline or something like that, so they were just throwing it all out at this point because they were like, `Okay. If we don't turn in two or three years, the company has told us that they're going to start writing off the brand and they're going to stop supporting it,` so they were just looking at `Hey, let's just do anything.` So they were willing to sort of let us hang ourselves on the project, which for me that's great. I would much rather get hung out to dry on a project that it's my fault that we took the wrong strategic thing than get shoehorned into something and then get blamed for it on the backend on why it doesn't work because I think the best stuff usually comes out of where you can talk with the planners about it and you can talk with the client about it and say, `Hey, what you believe about these kids, when you think ...` These kids that we're advertising to, when you think about logically the world that they're in, there's the world that grownups assign to them and the world that they actually live in. Like people think of kids playing with toys, watching cartoons, playing video games. Kids are also the same people that go outside and smash bugs on steps, break sticks to make swords out of them, and try to make soup in the toilet with food and flush it around. They live in a world where there are no rules until somebody tells them that there is. is when they're in a different mindset than you are and you're trying to find what the client's mindset is. That's the hardest, most uphill struggle ever. Anyway, with Lunchables, it all worked out well. We found good people to work with in the production aspect of it, too, that you were able to trust with a lot of the building of the brand. Everybody that we worked with along the way brought stuff to the party. The client let us play a lot with the planning, play a lot with planning out what the brand was going to do, what the promotions were going to be. We got in on it all, and we got to shape it for about three or four years, and that was a blast. At the beginning, they were pretty risk-tolerant, and that's what helped. Later on, because it was working for them, it's hard to tell how risk-tolerant they were because what we were doing was working, so they were kind of just letting us go. And as long as we didn't do any massive misfires or cause any explosions, they were being pretty nice to us. I think that was one where the actual brief came after the fact, the actual piece of paper. It was more air-briefed to us because they were in a little bit of a crunch at the time. They had gone through a couple rounds of creative when they came to us, and they had sort of thrown an idea out to the client of `What if we make there be some sort of icon that's sort of a super-heroic icon for Lunchables?` And that was all they had, and they came back and said, `This is it. And Lunchables is surprising and surprises kids at lunch and they love getting it. That's it. Go.` So it was incredibly open-ended. e started showing stuff that was working as they were concurrently working on the brief so that all the paperwork could go through. We helped shaped the brief, we helped shape the thinking so that when everything finally did go through, it's like everything was what we said it was going to be. they're doing stuff for kids, they look at what kids watch and what they're watching on TV, and they look at that and they go, `Okay. Well, this is what kids like, so we'll give them more of what they like.`   And I was like, `Boy, wouldn't it be cool if you could just take some of those action movie type things, put them into this cartoon type format?` And then when they see the action movies later on, they go, `Oh, I've already seen that sort of stuff.` It's like we've already outdone it before they've even got to it age wise. Once you make that jump on how kids are actually taking in stuff in the world, that changed everything with it, and that's how we fueled the whole thing. So it was a little strained there, but the actual clients I had worked with off and on for five or six years, so I could talk to the president of Oscar Mayer and not have to blink about it. It wasn't a big deal for me to get in front of him. I knew him. I didn't have conversations with him offline, but I sure wasn't scared of him. That definitely makes it easier to go in and present when you're not shaky about anything.",

    "text": "That one was mostly ... It had gotten to the point where I think the relationship had gotten so bad that ... I've spent a lot of time in my time here as kind of a fireman on a lot of projects, where me and my partner would come in when stuff was at the danger stage and things were really, really bad. Then that's when they would call us in because we could usually figure out what the client was saying that nobody was understanding because if you can't get their tone right in the end, it doesn't matter if you're putting all their right words in there. If you can't figure out what tone they're looking for, you're never going to get something by them. And we're pretty good about finding that, but with Philly the relationship had just gotten so bad that we were having to take a lot of dictates from the client to preserve the relationship. We were getting told from the account team a lot what we needed to do because the client requested it. It wasn't fun. It was a lot of doing things where you would do what you knew would be creatively acceptable and try to give them options based off of what they asked for to try to surprise them within that, but it was usually very difficult because if they asked you for something, they really just wanted literally what they were asking for, so they would never take our alternate options. And if a request was completely heinous or didn't make sense or something, we'd throw it up to the people, whoever was above us and say ... . And if a request was completely heinous or didn't make sense or something, we'd throw it up to the people, whoever was above us and say ... The client called wrap, and the account guy let them. And I totally read the account guy the riot act about it, but at the time she thought it was completely okay because the client is paying for it. I said, `No, the client is paying to have the commercial made, and I've shot everything they've asked me to, but we're shooting this shot for me because I think this shot is better and I would like to show them something better.` I talked to the client, and she was just, `Oh, this is going to cost us more money,` and stuff like that. It's like, `Don't sign the overage then. If for some reason we go over and you don't like what we did, don't sign the overage. Then you don't have to pay for it. It's really simple.` I'm kind of drifting all over the place, but basically where it doesn't work is when it breaks down so much that the client doesn't trust you enough to come up with the ideas and to believe in the ideas that you do have. If you don't even have that amount of trust or the amount of trust to let you drive a few blocks, you can't make something good. It's not possible because in the end some of what we do is still basically voodoo to the clients. It's magic, which that's why I like animation better than live action because live action, everybody thinks that, because of iMovie and stuff like that and `Oh, I've edited my home movies,` they think they basically understand the way things are supposed to work. Animation is still complete voodoo to clients. They don't know the way that it works, so it's like you have a lot more leeway and they have to trust you because they have to trust that you know what's ... `Oh. Well, they seem to understand that it's all going to look right in the end.` That's what makes it great. It forces the trust, which is good. But if you can't engender that amount of trust, you can't get any good work out of it. That one was a lot more. I'd say we were probably ... The average meeting of people on the client side of the table was about eight people that got to talk, and sometimes it went ... And there was always at least two levels that we had to go through. Sometimes they'd all be in the big meeting. Sometimes they wouldn't. And it could go to as many as three levels. You'd only get the one meeting though. If they weren't in the meeting when you were talking, you didn't get to talk to them, which definitely affected things. It was qualitative and quantitative, but we had run into multiple instances where the company that was running the tests, their interpretation of the data was pretty loose and we would actually ... Our planners here would challenge the data, and they'd have to acknowledge that we were correct on a lot of the interpretations of the data, but in the end that didn't make any difference because, unfortunately, we'd be attacking the premise, but the result was still on paper somewhere. It's like even though you change the premise, then the result has to be different, it's a deck and they read the results and they didn't care if we changed the premise. We would bring in stuff, and they would ... We would come in to talk about things, and their strategy would be like five words, and you'd go, `Oh, that's not a bad one thing.` Then you'd find out that each one of those five words meant something in that same sort of aspect, and you'd go, `Hey, that's insane. That's a five thing. Why didn't you just write that paragraph and then we could talk about the fact that this isn't going to be good before we start?` Budget could be. They got to a point where, because stuff wasn't working and they were spending so much on research, trying to find a magic bullet, that they started trying to figure out ways to do cheaper things. Like they were talked to us about shooting on video. Not HD, but video to bring stuff in. And they were looking for like a $60,000 commercial, and it's like, `Well, you can't have that.` That just doesn't exist in the world that we have with contracts. It's like, `Even with talent and stuff, we can't get you that.` But they didn't understand that at the time. They were just frustrated. Mostly it was ... I mean if you mean what inspired the final work? It was what was the best thing we could get out of what we were being forced to do and just try to make it as best we could and never be happy with what we did, but never give up on it either. I never quit on a brief, never quit on a project and said, `Oh, this is going to suck.` You could be unhappy with things that you had to put into it, but in the end it's like that's what you've got, is the last thing you did, so it's like you've got to try to make it as good as you can. You just have to also know that ... You'd go in knowing on some of these that it wasn't going to work, it wasn't going to do what they wanted it to, and you could [tell it 00:48:19] and you'd make everybody on your side of the fence, on the agency side of the fence know that you thought that and hope that somebody could maybe miraculously change the client's mind. All you can do is say what your opinion is and say you're going to make it the best you can, but if they don't change it, then you can't. The creative side was all pretty well locked together. The planners I think knew what the situation was, and I was pretty much on the same playing field as the planners. At the time I think with account it was just a matter of making ... It was a little rough, but it was only because there got to be a point where you could tell when somebody was looking for the path of least resistance and as a creative you just need to make sure that everybody knows that you're not it. So it's like you just make sure that they're aware that you're not the path of least resistance, the path of least resistance is elsewhere, so that would cause tension at some points, but in the end if my bosses said we needed to do something, there was never a fight and I made it very clear to the account guys going into that. It's like, `Listen, if you got my boss to tell me to do this, I will do it. You won't hear me complain about it. But I'm just not going to do that on my own volition,` and it usually would work out. We'd tell the account guys when they came in, it's like, `Okay. That's the line that I won't do that unless you get somebody above me to tell me to do that so I'm not responsible for that.` They would go talk to them. We'd get a phone call saying, `Can you just please do this for us?` Okay. And let it go. You just make sure that you're not responsible for the stuff that you know is terrible because you can only ... When you're underneath people, you can only go so far as to say, `I won't do this to a certain point.` I mean there's a point where you're not helping the agency either and it's like you don't want to be that. But there was a lot of dictation in that. In the end, I felt like our account guys got so scared of the client because they were so high maintenance that the client got away with a lot of stuff. It wasn't a relationship anymore. It was more just we're filling orders and they were trying to encroach on other people's tasks. Like I had one of them call wrap on one of my television students. And she's like, `Well, we've got what they want, and they're happy, so we're letting them wrap.` And I was like, `That's just simply not okay,` but the producer was a freelance producer, so she let the account person call wrap. I ended up getting my shot because the director heard and shot it once the client left the set, but it shouldn't be that. It should never be that. I have pretty good relationships with the clients usually. I always talk to the clients, tell them what's going on. If you don't even have that amount of trust or the amount of trust to let you drive a few blocks, you can't make something good. They didn't have risk tolerance. They thought that testing could tell you everything that you could possibly need to know, so if you didn't follow literally what they believed their test had told them ... Their test was a bible and if you didn't follow it, then you weren't following the words from above. Only if they didn't like the work. If they didn't like the work, then they would refit the brief to try to make us go where they already have their head. That's where I come back to that whole thing about knowing their tone and knowing who you're talking to. It gave me good training for listening to the client because you really had to read in between the lines and figure out what they wanted because that's really ... If you didn't get exactly what they were thinking tonally or basically the ballpark of what they liked executionally, then they figured their strategy must be wrong, so they'd rewrite the strategy and make you go at it again rather than just send you back to the drawing board because it meant that they must have briefed you wrong. It's like, `No, it's not that they briefed us wrong. It's that the strategy doesn't make sense.` Like they were talked to us about shooting on video. Not HD, but video to bring stuff in. And they were looking for like a $60,000 commercial, and it's like, `Well, you can't have that.` That just doesn't exist in the world that we have with contracts. It's like, `Even with talent and stuff, we can't get you that.` But they didn't understand that at the time. They were just frustrated. You'd go in knowing on some of these that it wasn't going to work, it wasn't going to do what they wanted it to, and you could [tell it 00:48:19] and you'd make everybody on your side of the fence, on the agency side of the fence know that you thought that and hope that somebody could maybe miraculously change the client's mind. All you can do is say what your opinion is and say you're going to make it the best you can, but if they don't change it, then you can't. From my aspect, pretty bad. At the time I think the people would've said that they were fine and it was just a difficult client, but I don't think we had the level of trust that we needed to make things work right.   So it's like you just make sure that they're aware that you're not the path of least resistance, the path of least resistance is elsewhere, so that would cause tension at some points",

    "text": "You know? Because it kind of got to the finishing process, and then that nervousness and that fear kicked in everything kind of flip flopped together against us, and we had to alter into a state that was not- Yeah. But, overall, it was ... I would say it was a positive scenario for us in that we were brought in last minute, we had to come up with something very quickly, and we were like, well let's just try this kind of weird idea for them, and they really liked ... It was almost like we walked in, when we went to present it, I'm like, they're gonna hate this. Because this is just not what they're about, but let's just go in and see what happens, and we did. We went in there and presented, and they really wanted the agency to bring them something that was different- The agency had been bringing them crap for so long. They were just, like, excited, they were like, yes, let's do it. The meeting, we presented it, the meeting's like, okay, and within the day, they're like, we're doing it, we're getting it done, and you know, that rarely ever happens. It was kind of timing, I think was in our favor, and a client that was hungry for taking a chance, because they'd been so conservative for so long. It was, once again, I'd say pretty nonexistent. We really didn't have much of a brief. Yeah, it was ... Trying to think of what it was. It was one of those kind of things were they were trying to put too much in it, we were trying to simplify it, make it work. Which, sometimes the generic brief works in your favor, I think, because then it's ... Favorable is when you can interpret that brief many ways, and you can sell a lot of different campaigns in. That kind of like, can answer to that brief, because it's not pinpointed. And I'd say a bad thing is when ... Sometimes too focused, and too narrow that it can only lead you down one path, and if you do anything off that path, it's like, the client will think it's ... So yeah, there is such a thing as too narrow and too wide. Yeah, we had a week, maybe, to work on it? Yeah. I would say it was ... I've had worse. I would say it was medium to crazy, you know what I mean? Somewhere in between being crazy and ... It was medium. Average budget. Some music and ... We didn't want to do what they'd always done. They had kind of a formulaic way of doing things, where they had all these copy points that ... Just stilted, copy, you know? Yeah, we actually used ... We knew we didn't want to do dialogue. Because their dialogue was really bad, and it was really, I like things with ... That are tasty, you know what I mean? So we looked at it, and we looked at what they were doing, we said, how can we not have to do that- We're not doing that. They were really looking for something different than what they'd been doing. But I think over the years, because of their research techniques, it always forced them into doing a thing a certain way. You know, because that's what tested, you know, and I think because we hadn't been working on it, we'd never worked on it before, we were really bringing fresh perspective to it, because we didn't know the rules, you know. And we were gonna break the rules, because we knew. Because we decided up front, it was part of our inspiration was not to do what had been done and to totally avoid it, because we knew it would end up bad if we did it. So that was kind of, like, you know. They were good. I think there was some in-fighting on the client- They would fight a little bit, but they did disagree with each other a little bit ... But ultimately, there was, you know, the person above that saying, disregard everything, which most of the good projects we've ever worked on, there's been the one true decision maker.   Yeah, in the case of Kraft, there's always someone that's up ... Is not involved in the day-to-day that has nothing to do with anything, that's just a figurehead. And then they have all this veto power over anything, even though they aren't involved with it, you know, and then people we've never even seen or heard of, you know? It's a good thing if you know the person, and you know- And they're hands-off. Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah, it was really good, actually. They were really behind the work. They were more excited about it than we were.",

    "text": "I think something that both of us worked on started off really well, and then totally fell out of place, which was Stouffer's. We worked on a big brand campaign for Stouffer's, and had to rethink the whole ... Their whole approach. Their whole communication. Would you agree? Well, the process started out where we wanted to own ... We wanted to own dinnertime, and so we did a lot of work against that, and we came up with some great ways I think of doing it, we had everything covered, every type of media. You know, come up with like the big idea, and kind of just, you know, kind of spread across everything nicely, and we were very happy with that, and it was a lot of work, it was kind of like pulling teeth to get to where it needed to be, but it was kind of the rewarding pulling teeth, you know, digging further in what this could be. And then after a while, things were going well, and then all of a sudden, for some reason, you know, the client, was like so excited about the campaign they sent us flowers and gift certificates- Balloons. And stuff like that. It was like, this is it, this is great, this is gonna be the new thing. And like a week later, after they had done some research or something like that- They did the research and started overthinking it. Overthinking it and all that stuff, and within like a matter of two weeks, it was like, campaign was dead, they hated it, and never wanted to- Someone disappeared with the gift certificates. It seems like a lot of projects start out well like that, where you will come to like, you will find the big idea, or what you think might be the good idea, and kind of the client's like, yeah, that's really good, and really interesting, they really get on board. But then they have ... Because they really haven't bought it, but it was kind of like buyer's remorse, like a week or two later. Where, I think we don't have the support to keep things sold, we kind of half sell it in, and then we don't keep it sold after that. We let us deal with their processes, to allow the clients, they'll have like these internal processes, that first of all, they don't want to have to make a decision. They're motivation is based on fear. I think fear's a big block to creativity, you know? So they're based on fear, they don't want to make a decision, so they have to have numbers to prove everything they do, and those numbers may be quantified, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's the right thing, you know We let us deal with their processes, to allow the clients, they'll have like these internal processes, that first of all, they don't want to have to make a decision. They're motivation is based on fear. I think fear's a big block to creativity, you know? So they're based on fear, they don't want to make a decision, so they have to have numbers to prove everything they do, and those numbers may be quantified, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's the right thing, you know? A lot of, you know, we have clients, that, you know, their bonuses are based on test scores, which have nothing to do with actual marketplace results, or the best work. You know, it's just I'll cover my ass sort of thing. So I think fear, on certain levels, whether it's within the agency or client are the biggest barriers to getting the best work done. If you had to boil it down to one word. Yeah. And it happens there, where you have people second-guessing stuff, like the day before a meeting, and instead of just saying, like, this is our best stab at it, we second guess it, and then we go in with work that doesn't hold as well together, because it's been ... We overthink things. Yeah. And I think in the cases where cases have done well, it's not that to overthink. You know, people over analyzing everything. Some of these clients, they'll do like, because I worked with much- We have no idea, because we knew of like, maybe three of them, but then we'd hear about other ones, later. So, I would say probably, I don't know. I would imagine there would be eight to 10 people that were making ... On the decision-making committee over there. Zero. Zero, zero. Yeah. And that's a big issue, is the research, and the way it's pulled off, you know. A lot of nonverbal type communications can't be tested the way they test, especially quantitatively. Because there's no ... It's all about repetition and you know, and you're testing something that's not real, you know, I don't know if you're familiar with Animatics, or [Fordamatics 00:10:46]. And they're also ... I worked with Leo Burnett for a long time, and I got so sick of testing and clients like, finally I called, I said to one of the clients, I said, okay, I think the testing they were using was ARS or one of those three other acronyms. And we actually called the company, said, can we see the commercials that you guys are testing against, you know, you're holding up whatever, as you know, the ones that kind of- Your benchmarks, or whatever. And can you send us a reel of those? And they send, and they were terrible spots, and then we went to the client, and said, we played them for them, I said, do you want your advertising to be like that? And they were like, no. I said but that's what you're testing our stuff against. And so that was actually, I'm sorry to go off of another project, but it was another positive. That actually helped them to realize well, that's not what I want our ads to end up as. Because we were in different ... We were brought in very early, and we helped decide the different areas and we all kind of narrow it down to what the one area should be. It does help when you're involved, you know, in the strategic portion, too, because we're the ones that have to do the work. A lot of time's they'll hand you a brief and say, this sucks. Because they aren't actually doing the work, they don't know how to write ... They think they do, depending on who the planner is, you know. And the clients. And very rarely do you get, the, I think the client and the agency or the planner at the agency to agree on what the brief is, even if we're like, yeah, that's pretty good. And the client will usually, yeah, but that's not what we want to say. And then it becomes a compromised version of ... It becomes kind of what we wanted and kind of what they wanted, and that's bad, because then you have two different things kind of fighting each other. Yeah, and there's two things, and it's easy to ... It's not hard to come up with good idea stuff, if you know what you're doing. But there's two reasons why you can't. One is you don't know what you're trying to say. The other one is you're trying to say too much, you know, and that's usually what the problem is. They're either trying to say too much, or it's so convoluted in the brief, it's like, there's some abstract- Yeah, we've seen that happen before. Or there's been times there's been like a client brief, and then an agency brief, and they're not quite aligned. Oh, yeah. Totally. And you're like ... That's like, that's offer briefing. And they're like, what? I didn't see that brief. Yeah. Although it seems like because the testing is so intense with a lot of this stuff, they spend so much money and they schedule, you know, sometimes we'll get like two weeks to work on a project, but then they'll test it for six weeks. You know? And then what happens is they have so much time between when they actually start the work and go into production, they have way too much time to think about it and over analyze everything. And people don't like ... A lot of times, these clients don't like to make a decision until the last minute. So it gives them to, you know, it's like they aren't doing their job unless they change things. Yeah, time is always dictated. On this project, timing was dictating by when things had to be in test, instead of when it had to really be in market. I think a lot of it was just drawing off of personal experience, I think, and just kind of relating it to, you know, how people live their lives. We never had any personal contact with them, you know, it was always handled through somebody else. So, I would say that the personal relationship was artificial. From what I can tell. People, they don't like us. We don't like them, but we act like we do. You know, everybody likes like they kind of like each other. We don't not like them personally, because we don't even know them. But just, from an outside perspective, because in this case, I mean, there's times where we go to clients, and we present to clients, but in this case, we did not, and I think it was because the client also would like to keep their meetings small, and like to always have the same familiar people in the room with them. Yeah, it was good. It was positive, it was like when it was high, everybody was high. And when things were going bad, everybody kind of felt that too. So it was like we were all in the same ship together.   No, not when we narrowed ... It wasn't, when we narrowed it down to what we wanted. You know, I think if you've been in the business long enough, you can kind of do everything. So, you know. And you know, as a creative, you kind of learn if you don't like a brief, you can just rewrite it anyways. So ...",

    "text": "Okay, so we went there and we took ten blocks.  We did some installations, photo exhibitions, art advertising for ten blocks.  It was like an experience for the consumer with the brand and on one side – two of the most popular teams here were born in Boca, so it takes you to soccer and the tradition, change and it’s full of local reminiscences.  So we took that neighborhood and we made it like a “Barrio Bonito” a soccer neighborhood. And if you tell me, well did 30 million people go see it?  No. The good thing about this was that the press took it and magnified the action where only 5 or 10 thousand people went. But through the press it make it to every paper and newscast, CNN, you know?  Everybody was talking about it on the radio and so the message made it to the people.  It was a success not just – well, the action was great and at the festival level it won everywhere.  It won a Grand Prix in Clio, where the agency had never won before.  It won the Grand Prix in San Sebastian.  It won everywhere except for the BMBA [ph] It’s not easy to intervene a neighborhood.  You have to get all the permits, the new contract and it’s not like a traditional media for advertising, where everything is already established and, like on TV, it’s there.  You put it on TV and it’s out there.  This was a lot more work, let’s say.  It wasn’t traditional media.  It was practically to come up with new media. In this one? 100% We were at risk all the time because it was a process that no one knew about and that was different, so we needed the client to take a risk and say, “Well, this can be done but it’s not going to go through the tradition approval channels and experimentation.” The brief didn’t say anything about a neighborhood.  The brief was what I told you before.  It was a problem.  The problem was that the concept took you back to Brazilian soccer and we are in Argentina, its rival.  So that was the problem.  We had a problem.  We had the brief and in reality we had to take down the “Joga bonito” campaign.  It was going to be a failure.  People were going to throw eggs at the billboards, which had already happened.  People don’t like billboard with Brazilian soccer players.  So to solve that problem we decided to hand our brief – What happens that it was about soccer and I was born playing soccer?  I watch soccer and it runs through my veins, you know?  Being born here and having soccer be the national sport inspired me. Let’s say it’s like when we work with soccer, it’s something that I am very familiar with.  You have it within you.  You have it on your skin.  I still play soccer and I play with a soccer team and do championships. With the client?  We as creative didn’t have a lot of friction.  On the production side there were a bit more because the client was nervous.  We had to launch it before the World Cup, so there was a deadline and on that part – and with having to get approved – it was sort of tense.  We weren’t’ on that part and we started thinking on the next, on how to implement them. Yes, it did.  We made it.  Nervous, but we made it. Yes, the account people.  No, great, they were very involved because they were the link between us, the client, the production, so they were very involved in the project.  Very involved. Yes, because in his kind of thing – it’s a lot easier to produce a commercial than this neighborhood, that’s why a sort of task force was need because everybody needed to be working; it wasn’t just creativity.  It was also about how you implemented it and produced it. No, it’s one we did here but it won awards in all the festivals.   So that phrase – In soccer, Argentina and Brazil are rivals.  So the problem we had here was having that global concept, “Joga Bonito” in this country. So we told the client, what if we take another concept for Argentina that is not “Joga Bonito?”  And Nike said, “No, work with ‘Joga Bonito.’”  So that was a big problem.  It was not good for the brand because you are taking it right to your rival, you see?  So what we did was – we came together, the creative team and the agency, my previous agency, which is BBDO. So that phrase – In soccer, Argentina and Brazil are rivals.  So the problem we had here was having that global concept, “Joga Bonito” in this country. So we told the client, what if we take another concept for Argentina that is not “Joga Bonito?”  And Nike said, “No, work with ‘Joga Bonito.’”",

    "text": "A project that didn’t go well? Projects don’t go well when you have a TV script and you don’t have the budget to do it as you would like, so you end up with a half produced idea. Yes, a thing about another project – it was also a project for Nike about the launch of the Boca t-shirt.  So we came up with a digital experience, which was really good.  It was a guy who was ____ the Boca t-shirt.  It was to present the new shirt and we came up with a web where you could go in and you could see how everyday they would be signing the shirt until you finally saw the new Boca shirt.  So it was approved by the local Nike client but it was never approved from the outside. So when it came out and people logged in from Spain and England and the person responsible for Nike in the U.S. learned about this and there was a problem because he hadn’t approved it and we had to take it down.  We couldn’t send it to any festivals or anything. Yes, what happens is that it was very fast and there wasn’t any time to approve it because – I don’t know why but there was a deadline or the guy over here liked it and he was afraid they wouldn’t approve it. The website and everything went well, what happened is that we couldn’t benefit from it in festivals.  We weren’t able to send it anywhere. Yes, it went public but what happens is that then they tell you not to send it anywhere because – No, we did it but you need to have their approval.  In this case in particular, we then sent whatever we liked, but Nike didn’t let you send – No, we really didn’t have any problems. When they approved something and we started producing it, we didn’t have a lot of bumps in the road. Too small.  The budget was for a graphic announcement and we did the web and that – He was very insecure and – In this second case they had a new French guy in Marketing and we didn’t get along very well.  He was very insecure and – We didn’t get along because he was very insecure So we crashed a lot.  For example, he didn’t know anything about soccer here and we did.  So we crashed because he was very stubborn.  He wouldn’t say, “Oh, you guys know.”  He wanted to have the work done his way, not ours. So the relationship worsened.  He wasn’t in this process; this is why it went so well. He was very much more like Nike was at the beginning.  __________, he always leaned towards that.  Very simple, not saying much more than, “Just do it.”  He wanted to take everything to that side and we always wanted to do new things.  So we crashed a lot.  For example, he didn’t know anything about soccer here and we did.  So we crashed because he was very stubborn.  He wouldn’t say, “Oh, you guys know.”  He wanted to have the work done his way, not ours. So the relationship worsened.  He wasn’t in this process; this is why it went so well. Yes. Yes.  If you have that guy who is the first approval filter, he can because you can’t go any higher.  When you have someone that works with you, he will go higher and – It was also fine because it was working smoothly.  They let us work so the processes were very well established. So it was approved by the local Nike client but it was never approved from the outside. So when it came out and people logged in from Spain and England and the person responsible for Nike in the U.S. learned about this and there was a problem because he hadn’t approved it and we had to take it down.  We couldn’t send it to any festivals or anything. We didn’t get along because he was very insecure and saw advertising very differently than we did.   So we crashed because he was very stubborn.  He wouldn’t say, “Oh, you guys know.”  He wanted to have the work done his way, not ours. So the relationship worsened.  He wasn’t in this process; this is why it went so well.",

    "text": "Well, that trail was in Libertador and Quintana in the Recoleta neighborhood.  There were some risks but they took them on.  The idea was worth those risks and it was really good. Yes, it was a medium risk and they took it. It was very – they became very involved with the ideas.  If they had to say, “This doesn’t go.”  They had arguments to say no.  Some clients tell you, “No because I don’t like it.”  And that’s not a valid answer.  Why don’t you like it?  What is it not communicating or what is it doing wrong?  I don’t like it is not a good argument.  I don’t like green.  The question is why don’t you like green?  In general this client – in other companies was not like that.  That’s what I tell you, the same client in different projects can change a lot.  So for this project they were really supportive, they said no with arguments. Maybe it wasn’t like that in other projects.  They said, “I don’t like it.” In my opinion is that sometimes you feel that it’s a round project and the brand doesn’t get very involved.  In the end – what’s not very important always works best in the end.  When they feel that it’s something very important, instead of helping it flow, they create a lot of obstacles and they don’t realize that the process is a lot worse that way and so is the quality of the ideas.  But it’s very hard to create that kind of relationship.  If the TV spot is very important for them, you can take them through other roads.  Now, with TV you probably won’t be able to top the idea. Because it’s so important to them and they get too involved and they look for too many explanations for something that isn’t as rational.  In general we are sometimes against the famous testing because you analyze reasons that shouldn’t be analyzed.  “No because I don’t like the woman’s hairdo.”  And then they tell you but hey, let’s go to the core of the idea.  It doesn’t matter how she’s wearing her hair. You take apart the idea and it loses its value. No, it think it’s very complex. They think very differently in general. There are cases of great brands where things work great, where client and agency work as – in reality that thing were “The client bounces this back” is kind of old.  You really have to work as a team.  He has the brand and knows it.  We try to get informed to get to know the brand but it is true that if I set a matrix and it may work for some projects but not for others.  That matrix won’t assure you that it will work.  I won’t say, “Let’s do this and it will work for every project.”  It’s like everything, when you have a very strict matrix, you get tired of it.  There will come a time where he will tire of those ideas because you will have to fit them into that rigid matrix.  So it’s kind of a balance between a not so rigid matrix. The thing is that it’s hard because maybe what looks hard for us might not look that way to them; it might look pretty flexible to them.  I don’t know.  In general, that discussion between accounts and creative is further away although it still exists.  That moment where the account person tells you, “No, I cannot say that.”  And you think we’ll let the client decide, why aren’t we presenting this?  “No, because I know the client.”  “Let’s go.” The only thing he will say is “change this for me.”  It’s not that terrible. In general, that discussion between accounts and creative is further away although it still exists.  That moment where the account person tells you, “No, I cannot say that.”  And you think we’ll let the client decide, why aren’t we presenting this?  “No, because I know the client.”  “Let’s go.” The only thing he will say is “change this for me.”  It’s not that terrible. No, pretty good.  Obviously there are fights in some processes but it’s the logical thing in any process. We didn’t beat each other.  There were pretty intense fights in general over time because sometimes the client and the account people think that ideas come out of the blue and they don’t.  So it’s always that discussion of having more time.  What happens is that you also have a deadline and everybody is running to make it to that date. Very well, too.  In genera’s like that project that comes out perfect, where we are pretty much on the same page about where to take it.  It was a round project. Did you see that when you go to the subway you go through that 0:27:49.8, in reality it’s almost automatic, but what we did was paste that 0:28:00.1 and so now everybody can run.  Inspiration comes from the fact that you like running and you try to share that moment and to use that idea that everybody can make i what’s not very important always works best in the end.  When they feel that it’s something very important, instead of helping it flow, they create a lot of obstacles and they don’t realize that the process is a lot worse that way and so is the quality of the ideas. “No because I don’t like the woman’s hairdo.”  And then they tell you but hey, let’s go to the core of the idea.

So you get an idea – it was very successful, the people that went to the zoo to the execution and suddenly they changed the manager and the next campaign was a torture.

No, in general there is very rare to have – it can be that someone woke up in a bad mood one day and – it can happen to you, we all have bad days.  You wake up against the world, you want to fight everyone and that happens; but in general everything flows within our team.  The thing is that with we did have friction with the account people.

    "text": "Yes that went well, the process went well, we presented three different campaigns. That was the first work we did for that client and they were graphic campaigns, and they immediately approved one and they trusted how we were going to produce it.  We produced it in a very particular way with some miniature modes were we made the animals and people who visited the park, it was like a cartoon they looked like toys.  Which is a process that the clients have to trust because you can’t visualize it until it is done. But they trusted us and they models came out very well and the campaign was out on the streets, it was very talked about and it won several awards in the Creative Circle Festival which is the most important one in Argentina.  It was a very good process; it was good from beginning to end. The ones we dealt with were marketing or advertising managers, and the final word, even when we didn’t have any contact with her, did come from the director of Temaiken, we did not have any contact with her.  She was not in all of the process, they are the directors at the highest level, they are almost the owners of the company, they do see it in a more advanced process. Oh inside our team?  Yes, they were very good.  Yes, that is very important that the relationships inside the team are also good. Video, yes, they had chosen the agency because they liked the creativity style of the agency, so then they trusted the ideas of the agency, they were very open to move on with this resolution, with creativity. n the end there were some dialogues as if the animals could talk, because in children’s imagination animals can think and talk, it was like a dialogue between the young kid, the little boy and the animal. I believe that they both said the same thing. In the sense that they allowed the process to flow, I mean when a client has a very good relationship with the agency, they are open to recommendations and ideas from the agency and also open to trust what the agency is telling them is good for their brand.  Also, let’s say we are open to corrections of what they think is necessary.  I mean they know the brand, but when the process is good, everything is constructive.  And that was the case. Good. I mean they also supported the campaign we presented they also worked toward the same goal, they also had a good relationship, they played their part with the client.  They made the client feel comfortable too.  It was a good process in general.   Well, that we all agreed and we all worked together and it was very clear to us what we wanted and, yes we all worked together toward the same goal.  It is a relationship that happens, if it is good, it is good for all of the projects.  It is important for it to be good, I don’t know if there is anything else you would like to know about how good it was.  It is not that they all say, “Okay it’s fine” to this and that but that the discussions and the insight, I mean it makes the work grow, that is what a good relationship is.",

I came into the agency to work in that last part and it was the worst part of the process, because they were constantly asking for new campaign alternatives and they never approved one, and it was very exhausting because we worked for many days and many nights we slept in our houses during the day and we continued working. No time was normal, the right one for the project. The budget was large. No the agency started working normally with the project that they had requested and we worked for two months and approximately, during the process, the agency began to notice that there were other issues, that it was not just a creativity issue.  So then they exhausted people who overworked and they were never going to accept the proposal. To change?  Well, I don’t know I came in at the very end of the process and there was an agency at the moment which was ________ and they were very popular at the moment and they were landing very large projects and they had like a certain freshness. t was a very exhausting process because the client was not entirely happy with the agency, they wanted a change of agency; the relationship got to a point were things were no longer okay.  I came into the agency to work in that last part and it was the worst part of the process, because they were constantly asking for new campaign alternatives and they never approved one, and it was very exhausting because we worked for many days and many nights we slept in our houses during the day and we continued working. It was a month and half that was very exhausting that finally got nowhere, so it was a process that I remember, because I personally felt trapped because I had all of my energy focused on that, I had just entered the agency and I could not leave it so quickly.  I didn’t have time to even explore any alternatives, I couldn’t stop working, I mean it was exhausting for everyone who worked there and for me it was very exhausting. But when the project finally came out with another agency they did have like a higher tolerance, they weren’t very open to ideas with our agency. With the agency, I mean it was very confusing; I mean there wasn’t anything clear. But when the project finally came out with another agency they did have like a higher tolerance, they weren’t very open to ideas with our agency. It wasn’t good.  It wasn’t good because they didn’t analyze the proposal objectively because they had another problem with the agency, the relationship wore out and they had the intention to work with another agency, and they weren’t’ very clear for a very long time and they made the agency work a lot and they didn’t use that work afterwards. Yes, I mean it was weird because a lot of people outside the agency had to be called in to work.  We worked a lot of weekends and entire weeks, we were all quite tolerant because we were all a little bit tired and upset.   Oh the client.  Well, I believe that if they were going to make the choice or already had made the choice to change agencies they should have said that first instead of giving the project to the agency.",

    "text": "The video that explains, “Halls launches its new product.” That might be good to have the case, at least. The tolerance was high because obstacles come up during the process that have to do with the direction of the actor, in this case it wasn’t a cute guy. He had the virtue of doing a thousand things with his mouth, which was what the spot was about. So h wasn’t a cute guy, he wasn’t a typical advertising guy. He was sort of tan and over here people of a darker complexion are of lower socio-economic background. In fact, this guy lived in a very poor neighborhood of the city. So from accepting this person to be on TV and making a website with the costs and risks of doing something they had never done before. They didn’t even have an institutional website. They trusted us to do all this part which we had never done before, so their tolerance was very high regarding the work. We developed a very good relationship with them and they still ask us for a bunch of things, which they didn’t ask before. It was from this job on that they – the brand manager went up to regional manager and the executive manager went up to local manager. It meant an advancement in their career, as well; not 100 percent because of us, logically, but our work did help in the success process. So that’s why it was good; the risk was high and they handled it pretty well. The project was from medium to high. It wasn’t a very big budget but it wasn’t a budget that wouldn’t let you do anything. It was a medium to high budget; it was a good one. Yes, normal. If take the whole project into account, it developed in about three months. It was everything, from the moment we thought about the first spot to the moment it went on air and the activations and events took place in public spaces three months went by. Yes, narrow-minded. That. But it was very good. We started very well. All the presentations were very fun; meetings were very informal. That’s something we propose from the start of a meeting, to have something that is not as rigid. We say that we can have fun and do a good job at the same time. That’s why the meeting has to do with that, with doing a good job, having fun and making the process a good process leading to a good job. The example was – you can see that because the meetings were very fun, the shootings too, the web development happened very naturally and it was very fun. I can tell you today I had a meeting at Halls and I saw the brand manager who now is the regional manager, she is now pregnant, and I saw her and we hugged each other as if we were best friend. “How cute, you are having a baby.” It’s a very beautiful relationship that creates good results in the end. It’s not that it wouldn’t happen any other way, but at least the process was fun and I give the process a 100 positive evaluation because of that, because it was personally very beautiful to have worked with them and the result, beyond just business, it was good as well. _______. They trusted us to do all this part which we had never done before, so their tolerance was very high regarding the work. So the idea started from saying, “Well, what happens if we put someone like that with a candy and he starts chewing it and then sounds start coming out?” It was sort of playing with your mouth because the other Halls you couldn’t bite it, you could only suck on it. In this case you could chew it and you had some more freedom with – The relationship with the client was very good from the start. The client was someone very interesting, intelligent, open-minded. That was the brand manager. The one below that, the executive manager, was not as liberal, he was more – how do you say it?   That’s something we propose from the start of a meeting, to have something that is not as rigid. We say that we can have fun and do a good job at the same time. That’s why the meeting has to do with that, with doing a good job, having fun and making the process a good process leading to a good job. The example was – you can see that because the meetings were very fun, the shootings too, the web development happened very naturally and it was very fun. No, it does matter but at the moment when they have to talk to the client it becomes a complicated job from that place. They are the fuse between the creatives and the client, so they have to answer to both sides and sometimes they lose sight of the fact that they are working for JWT and not for Cadbury. So sometimes they think they are working more for Cadbury than from JWT.",

    "text": "Let me see if I can narrate it properly. Personally, the case was successful for the agency. It wasn’t successful – I mean, it was a case that brought legal problems. It bought me a lot of personal problems because I was focused on that project for a whole month and it practically consumed my life. It was five months ago. It was the second job we did, so we did this one and then we did this one I am telling you about. You clicked on that banner and it took you to the website of the promotion where five friends go to Brazil entering the code of the bottle. It’s the normal and simple promotion but it also had this story that sent people to the website. A lot of people went in, about 100 thousands. It’s a lot here. It’s not a lot outside, but here it is. Petition Online has a ranking, the site where we did the petition, they have a Top 10 of the most viewed and most signed petitions in the world and Alejo’s petition made it to number one. Above the ones about Bush and the whales. After that an anti-blog came out accusing Alejo of lying and trying to unmask the mystery of this blog. The anti-blog was clearly created by Fernet’s competitor to neutralize this move, which had made it to the news, the prime time news. The case of Alejo made it to TV and the two reporters where talking about it and showing the videos and saying, “Let’s help him. We have to sign.” It was crazy and it was all a lie. So at a certain point we were very excited with the idea and then we also started feeling bad because we were lying to a lot of people. That’s why it was very bad and disturbing personally because I even talked about it with my psychologist. I explained the whole case and I said that I felt really bad, that I wanted it all to end and the client was more excited every day because he saw this thing growing but of course it was me answering the mails of the people who was saying, “I’ll support you.” Some people wanted to send money; there were people who wanted to lend us their house in Brazil and I was Alejo and I was answering all their mails. It was terrible. It consumed a month of my life and I had a terrible time because of this guilt. It started as something that was not supposed to explode like this and it did. People really committed to the cause and they supported it and it was all a lie. So for the case this was very tough. It was a very strong exercise that proved a lot of things but the client said, “Well, I am very happy but let’s stop this. I don’t want to talk about this anymore.” We closed it. We collected the 50 thousand signatures. We did a thank you video with Alejo and that was it. We closed it and it went away. Some people wanted to send money; there were people who wanted to lend us their house in Brazil and I was Alejo and I was answering all their mails. It was terrible. It consumed a month of my life and I had a terrible time because of this guilt. The promotion went well, not as well as expected but it was a terrible case. I got mails of people who were telling me, “Look, this guy is trying to collect signatures. Go in a sign.” So it had all turned around and I had gotten an email from a friend from college I hadn’t seen in a long time telling me about Alejo and I had done it. The lie was coming back to me. I was very tense. It was an experiment. We knew it was an experiment but it ended up exploding. There was a trial for false advertising that was resolved and didn’t present more problems but it started very good and it ended up being not good at all. It seems obvious. No, well it was – I mean, that happened where they were very scared and we were very excited and then it turned around. They became very excited to see that it was on TV, their brand and that people were logging in. We were scared because if there were legal problems after that we would have to face them, which was what happened. I don’t know how I am still working and talking with you; I don’t know how they didn’t kick me out but they are very happy over here with that. Jimmy Evans, the regional creative director is going around the countries talking about several cases, this one among them, because it was a very good exercise in regards of media. The client had bought some banners online for a lot of money and the entire thing cost us $1000, and distributing the banners costs $30,000 or $40,000. And a lot more people logged into the Fernet website via the $1000 blog than via the $40,000 banners. So that is a very interesting study. They are spending a lot of money on some banners that don’t have the same result than a story has, which in this case was a lie and I wouldn’t do it again, but it is about an alternative way to drive people to the website. It’s very cheap. So the tolerance was very high. In fact, we said this is an experiment. We don’t know how this will turn out. This may explode or not; maybe nothing will happen. It ended up exploding and that was it. It was regular. Poor. Well, personal stories from friends. The concept, the idea of this Fernet is before anything. So we thought that during the vacations, the best thing is to be with your friend. The target matched that and so we decided to do a trip to Brazil with five friends. But that wasn’t really relevant. In general, the most relevant thing was the blog and Alejo’s case. Alejo is actually one of my closest friends. The actor is one of my closest friends. I would talk to him all the time and he would tell me that he was being recognized all the time in the street, and they would tell him, “You are the guy that can’t go on vacation with his friends.” Terrible. I also got him in a terrible situation. I don’t want to bore you with that but – It was very good. Something very similar to what happened with Halls occurred. We bought Fernet for the meeting and – Fernet is a drink you drink with Coca Cola. You pour Fernet and Coke. We bought Coke and their Fernet and we set up a bar in the meeting room and when they got there, there was music. We served some Fernet and we asked them to serve it because they were the experts. We had ice, Coke, we talked and listened to music and then we started with the presentation, which were some videos we had put together and that were pretty simple to narrate. We told them about the promotion, they liked it, we moved on and from there the blog idea came up and we presented it in another presentation. They liked it and it went pretty well. I was very warm. Yes, we are together and we agreed on how it had all come together. I started getting complicated from the start. They didn’t have a very good relationship with the people from the web department. Apparently the web material – not the blog. I was doing the blog and I didn’t have any intervention from any of the web people. But the people from web didn’t have a very good relationship with the client because they weren’t happy with what had been presented to them, with the aesthetics and the promptness in responding to their orders. The client wanted to see something the next day and they couldn’t do it and neither did they a week after. It was sort of bad. In fact, we won this pitch and the company decided to stop doing pitches and chose us as their permanent agency. Yes. Look, there is a person who works on BTL and always supported the idea of making the blog and also fought for it as we did, which usually doesn’t happen. He insisted and insisted despite the clients fears and it all happened also thanks to him. When the whole legal thing happened, where we didn’t really intervene, he took care of it all. He went to the hearings and talked to the judge. The entire legal matter, with the attorneys and everything, was handled by him, so I can’t say anything about that. es.

Yes, it was an exercise with very good results in one hand and a lot of teachings on the other. We could have taken the actor and used his real name, however we changed it. The actor was called Gonzalo Martinez. John Smith. We could’ve gone with John Smith can’t go on vacation and we didn’t we went with Alejo. So from there – and another mistake, the biggest mistake was that his name was Alejo Castellani, my last name, the creative director of the agency that has that account. A very rookie mistake. It’s just that we had never done it before. he case of Alejo made it to TV and the two reporters where talking about it and showing the videos and saying, “Let’s help him. We have to sign.” It was crazy and it was all a lie. So at a certain point we were very excited with the idea and then we also started feeling bad because we were lying to a lot of people. That’s why it was very bad and disturbing personally because I even talked about it with my psychologist. I explained the whole case and I said that I felt really bad, that I wanted it all to end and the client was more excited every day because he saw this thing growing but of course it was me answering the mails of the people who was saying, “I’ll support you.” Horrible. Horrible. I consumed me. I had a tough time at home, discussions with my wife. I was nervous, stressed, terrible. We were scared because if there were legal problems after that we would have to face them, which was what happened. I don’t know how I am still working and talking with you; I don’t know how they didn’t kick me out but they are very happy over here with that They did the same brief for all the agencies and nobody had the chance to propose anything else. It was pitch and nobody had the change to discuss it.   I was doing the blog and I didn’t have any intervention from any of the web people. But the people from web didn’t have a very good relationship with the client because they weren’t happy with what had been presented to them, with the aesthetics and the promptness in responding to their orders. The client wanted to see something the next day and they couldn’t do it and neither did they a week after. It happened differently with the web people, they didn’t want to work with them anymore. o from there – and another mistake, the biggest mistake was that his name was Alejo Castellani, my last name, the creative director of the agency that has that account.

But what I like the most is that the construction started with the agency and of how you can reach people with creativity, and for me that has been my most complete case. More than a specific case it’s one that I always talk about when _________. I don’t know if this is useful for you. There are several. I have a project – I managed a paper in another agency called La Tercera and I got to take it when it was a bad diary, yellow press, yellow headlines, visually ugly. I got to go through all the story from the point when the client wanted to compete with – you know Chile – I want to compete with Mercurio, I want to be on that level. I lived that entire process during five years where I had a client and I really experienced really being a partner with the client. We had really good discussions. I think he understood that his road was creativity, and like you said, everything we did worked really well with what we wanted as a future brand. From there – a specific case was that in a moment we established that La Tercera would go after the truth. It would be the diary that told you the truth and everything went in that direction and we did beautiful campaigns. All institutional communication had to do with that and I looked at that after five of seven years and today it is Mercurio’s biggest competitor. Mercurio had to take down a lot of things.

But what I like the most is that the construction started with the agency and of how you can reach people with creativity, and for me that has been my most complete case. More than a specific case it’s one that I always talk about when _________. I don’t know It was a directory that had – first we had a marketing manager, a general manager, the CEO was even in the important meetings and besides them two people more. But the quick decisions were made by two people. Yes. There were people working under them, of course, in order to do things quickly but yes. Two high level people and on bigger things like the campaign, all five of them would come. Yes, high. When you talk about people who are different – they would take – and it’s not that they felt they were taking a risk. They felt that there’s where the difference with Mercurio lay, speaking of ______. The exposure x piece will have in the media. How many times – if it’s a brand with a lot of money, I put the spot on TV and play it over and over. That’s a lot of GRB. There are brands like La Tercera, where they didn’t have a lot of money for their exposure so they understood that creativity was going to make the consumer pay attention to the message. It was going to get their attention because it had less plays than another brand that can play it and play it and the message gets in because of that repetition. In that sense they understood that it was better to have a media strategy. Few impacts but on shows that had a high rating and with a message that would catch people’s attention, and we build everything from there because we didn’t have a big budget in that sense. A context, a moment where things happened. But the most important thing for me was the team. The talent that they had. In terms of the relationships with them? No, it’s just that. It was an issue of trust, of trusting each other and respecting and saying, “Yes, you are right.” Sometimes it was arguing and explaining to the other side as well as accepting when we were wrong too. They were very good. I think they were above average because they didn’t just work, it also transformed into our social life, a team. I don’t know if that was very good in the end, but at that moment we did our best pieces and as a result La Tercera is what it is today. That team went everywhere together, we saw each other a lot and we also loved each other in the sense of respect. Yes, we didn’t have those old limits where – I saw that maybe because since it was more of a boutique, it had a lighter structure. At the beginning we tested until we stopped doing it because, as I tell you, it was a trusting relationship. “Oh, you are the experts, you understand…” And they understood that sometimes testing kills things with no sense at all. Too low. Institutional campaigns had normal budgets, but little GRB. Do you know what I mean by GRB? Several things. It happened that at that moment we had a very inspiring agency. Working at that agency, with that people, at that place where we worked. It happened that for a moment a lot of people who loved each other very much came together. There was a lot of young talent under us and one of those moments happened where for two years people that thought in a very similar way came together in that agency; we had a lot of ideas, the place was ideal, we had a very good relationship and I attribute that wonderful job to that because an ideal team came together. Very much a partner, very trusting in that we were the experts on this matter.    That team went everywhere together, we saw each other a lot and we also loved each other in the sense of respect.",

I don’t have that much information but I think that they weren’t accessible and it seems that they had something very precise in mind and what that happens they don’t open up –   Of course, I sent the project from here in Chile to Argentina and they presented it. It happened that in the end they didn’t choose anybody’s idea and it think they threw away good Argentinian projects, like ours. But _____, what I was telling you about, in comparison maybe. It was a pitch, you don’t know the client. Maybe I can present that to – if I had managed Paris for five years and I take that project, maybe that project would’ve been accepted out of a conversation, you know? But maybe there wasn’t a good example because it was a pitch. The most important thing was that it had to show all the different kinds of women there are. To go outside that perfect model in that sense. The brief said that, it was very inspiring and we went with that. Almost literally, what we came up was that all women are beautiful and are beautiful when they feel good about themselves.",

    "text": "We always worked for this department store, we tried to work with care both graphically and creatively but it was really impossible. I mean I know that it is always possible and that you can improve it little by little but this was a case of study I believe. We handed in ideas and we began to work on them and we made more briefs, excuse me, we handed in more scripts and at the end of all of the scripts they would say, “No” they wanted to show the guy who is the campaign image, “I want him showing the products” and that always happened. And that was one failure after the next. I was working with them for two years and they were two important failures because we could never sell the client anything that would interest them, and I felt that it was entirely ________ to not be able to offer that. I believe that was a huge failure, electro-offers from HITES. The clients, there were three stages, marketing, management and general management and generally going through the first stage was very difficult and reaching the last one was practically impossible, they were like ten people in total. It was a very informative brief, they were very clear on what we had to say, so then the briefs were more about displaying the product so then the briefs were like, “We have to make a commercial for HITES for electro-offers on their electronics, and these are all of the prices and the famous________ “ which is how to place the things on the grid, there wasn’t much. And it was not really necessary to do those things because with that type of client it was more about making a showcase rather than anything different. We handed in ideas and we began to work on them and we made more briefs, excuse me, we handed in more scripts and at the end of all of the scripts they would say, “No” they wanted to show the guy who is the campaign image, “I want him showing the products” and that always happened. And that was one failure after the next. It was zero, really zero, I can’t even say two because it would be too generous, it was very low. Very little time and a very low budget, it was very, very low despite being a large store, it was very cheap. They gave us very little money so then we had service providers that were not so good. So then that is a synergy of things that happen because if your service provider is bad then generally the final product is not going to be as good as if you paid more money. What happened with these clients is that they asked for everything very fast, they had very poor manners with the people from accounts, we just dealt with them in meetings and they rejected a lot of work. Since it was a big client they knew the power they had to demand the things they demanded. I mean, that would never happened with a small client, you were supposed to obey their demands which they made with only one day’s notice. Things that are unacceptable, this made for a bad relationship.   There were good relationships within the team, this client exhausted the team also, and obviously we were here until late hours on several days in a row, and that generated a very uncomfortable environment but there were always good relationship.",

    "text": "No, there are two project with which I fell in love. There’s a project that won Cannes last year. Regardless of the award, it’s an idea that had been around for about two years. It wasn’t an idea of worldwide impact. In fact, it’s a graphic idea, but what I find interesting about that and the award, was that it was an idea that worked like it should’ve worked despite the fact that in the road other possibilities emerged, but we had the stature – that’s how the art director put it. We were working next to him and he said, “You know, no. If it’s like that, the idea doesn’t have the same power.” And we stood strong that was very hard, to say “no, no” But when it happened, everything took place and the idea was – obviously as does everywhere else, here you finish the working year in December, people get together and we had a client who is Visine, which are eye drops. A client with no money and with strong competition back then. No, no, it’s a Chilean company, what happens is that ADO had a _____ in Spain. They started way before and since there is ADO in Spain, they have won more Olympic medals than in their entire Olympic history and it was that model which was replicated here and we already had some results in the last Pan-American Games with all the athletes. The campaign is also weird. This was always thought of as a public service campaign and what makes me very proud about that project is that the role the agency took on as communicators when we said, “No, this is not a public service campaign.” We had to design, we had the whole architecture of the project, not just what we generally do which are the traditional communication pieces. Well the hard thing about this project was that, I think. There were the people from ADO, which were three plus each one of the brands involved. So each idea, each piece, each slogan, the logo, we had to present that to a lot of people. We had campaign presentations where we had 20 people, 15 people and they all had an opinion. That was – I think that experience has been – in fact I am working on another project now and they assigned it to me because of this experience I had there with this atypical case. Generally, you have two or three people in the decision making process and luckily you have access to the person in charge and if not you have to wait for those floor managers to get to their managers, but in this case it was too many people with a lot of interests and different opinions. When you generate pieces you also had the opinions from the athletes, the federations, the government. It was a lot of people. I think it was high. I think that since the moment when Coca Cola or a bank decide to put money into this, the moment someone decides in a country like Chile where sports isn’t an issue to make it an issue. The risk starts at the very generation of the project. The companies tested it. When you asked me what things stimulate me, there’s something that stimulates me very little and is working on campaigns that will be tested. I hate tests. I feel that a lot of times you learn from tests but that a lot of times they blur the _____ group, it always happens that one or two people are leaders and the person from the company – it’s a great business. If everything goes great, you wouldn’t need to test them. They part from the idea that they have to find something wrong with it. It’s math. If there’s something that makes me uncomfortable is that – it doesn’t matter if you do qualitative testing, you evaluate the ideas and from there you improve the piece. Because – let’s see, I think that this time we didn’t have such a formal brief as we usually do. I have a big issue with briefs. I believe that briefs are very little stimulating. I believe that they are mostly limited to – and in general I don’t know what company has overcome this – to translate to other words that which the client is asking. They are crap, in general, I must say. I think that in the end the best briefs, after they have gone through a creative process and you take that conversation again with them – there are briefs we have returned to the client because there’s an area – briefs, I don’t know why they always come within this comfort zone, where nothing or no one is left outside, where nobody is offended. They never say anything bad about the product, they never say the good – so they are little _____, they are not inquisitive enough, they question very little. They always use the same words, they never have an image, a song, something else fun that is being done. ______ let’s think of something else. I believe that briefs are pretty much just paper work and they don’t get the time, even when they take a week to generate a brief, and you have to put out the campaign in ten days and you don’t see that week spent working on the brief. Do you know what? This time the experience inspired us a lot. I was an athlete and I was a National Swimming Athlete, and it happened that – even when I come from a very athletic family, my family is more of an academic world especially because of sports but I feel that there was a potential in my family and it was abandoned and it was always set aside because it wasn’t a possible career. You can’t live from sports and I am happy with what I am doing and I don’t regret it at all, but for me it was something very personal. It was a challenge. I feel that it was a gift to get this campaign. No, it was a coincidence. For the rest of it I think that the challenge where you had to do everything from zero; it was all designing, it was the architecture of it, from the logo, names, how to communicate because you have to talk one way to the companies and another to the _______ while having the same concept. That was very exciting for everybody. It was a new project in how it needed to be approached and I think that also stimulated the team a lot, where copies were able to write a lot, the art director were able to do beautiful things, each one in their technical world could take risks and say real things. That. Good even when there were so many clients. There were hard times and there were also fights but in general it was good. Everybody sort of took on the flag of reverting our historic reality and the project became more important than imposing your opinion or your point of view or getting your logo in first or not. The common interest overrode personal interest, even with the brands and that generated – made it possible for the project to move forward. Even the companies realized that it was impossible to have so many different opinions, so they chose two different brands to lead the way and it was something that came from them, “Hey, we 15 cannot have an opinion. Who will do it? You two and we vote for you two.” And that was great. Great. In the sense that the project was so important and ambitious that there was a lot of _____ to understand for example the issue of timing on both sides, on the creative side we had to understand that there were things that couldn’t last for months and that had to take less than that because we would then loose the Pan-American games and things like that, and to also understand that we had to look for a strategic campaign or support for the campaign to move forward without losing the execution on TV, which was something that required special effects, it took longer and to say, “Okay, let’s not do the three pieces at once. Let’s do one first.” And to understand that – even in the presentation to say, we are ready to go but we are not all happy. We still have another day, another week to work. Okay, if you are not happy, let’s do it. And the account and marketing team would communicate that to the client and the client would _____. It was healthy in that sense, in understanding that the job had to be a ten and that we all had to work as a team even when it meant to move pieces because of the timing issue. Generally there’s a lot of worry about meeting the client’s deadline, the timing I proposed and in the end it doesn’t matter how well the piece looks. Sometimes that betrays us and I think this time it didn’t. It also made the account people earn our respect and that we could also do our work well and renovate the respect they had invested in us. I think that you always have to I think that when we took on this project, the people from planning was going through some adjustments because it was a very distant planning and with little field work with the creatives. I was a moment of change and that changed, let’s say. There’s another project we have today that’s in essence like the ADO one, where planning has had – I felt that strategically, yes – I feel that planning was very distant from the creative process at that time. but in this case it was too many people with a lot of interests and different opinions. When you generate pieces you also had the opinions from the athletes, the federations, the government. It was a lot of people. If everything goes great, you wouldn’t need to test them. They part from the idea that they have to find something wrong with it. It’s math. If there’s something that makes me uncomfortable is that – it doesn’t matter if you do qualitative testing, you evaluate the ideas and from there you improve the piece. The companies tested it. When you asked me what things stimulate me, there’s something that stimulates me very little and is working on campaigns that will be tested. I hate tests. I feel that a lot of times you learn from tests but that a lot of times they blur the _____ group The brief was to make of sports a relevant issue for Chileans. To put it in the conversations and in the interest of Chileans, the issue of sports on every level, from investing companies, to media coverage, to federations and secure them in the slow and painful job they are conducting, to the athletes in telling them, “You know what? When your younger brother says that he wants to be a basketball player, you instead of saying don’t even think about it, tell him okay, go for it.”   ecause – let’s see, I think that this time we didn’t have such a formal brief as we usually do. I have a big issue with briefs. I believe that briefs are very little stimulating. I believe that they are mostly limited to – and in general I don’t know what company has overcome this – to translate to other words that which the client is asking.

    "text": "Yes. There are pitches we have won for creativity or where they have been very relevant, but I feel that most of them are obtained a different way, through letters. And I think that you put too much into – I love the idea that my teams invests itself a lot in pitches and every time we get it it’s like a new toy, perfect; but I feel that sometimes very powerful things come along and the decisions are made based on something else, no the campaign. I feel that it’s a failure. I feel that even when you have presented great ideas, they weren’t enough and it’s like a kid’s thing, but that they weren’t capable of breaking the personal agreements, the – how do we call it? – Off the record meetings where most decide if the account will come over or not, _______ the money. That frustrates me a lot, I don’t know if the project is a failure but – I think we did an excellent job and in the end it went to a very bad campaign, you are watching it on-air and it’s very bad. So you start questioning – and it has happened – whether it’s good to present such a good idea or if it’s better to present something more comfortable to win the pitch. I feel that it as a failure because we wanted to innovate and we wanted to say, “Let’s say it differently.” We presented great pieces, but in the end it went to what we suspected might get it. I feel that failure in not having said, “You know what? Let’s not do something as creative. Let’s do something with more effects with a song that everybody will hum every day and let’s win the pitch.” I feel that it’s a failure from the creative standpoint, not having given up or not understanding that there are some basic roads that work for winning.

Let’s do something with more effects with a song that everybody will hum every day and let’s win the pitch.” I feel that it’s a failure from the creative standpoint, not having given up or not understanding that there are some basic roads that work for winning. Yes. Huge. I saw one of the clients who is friends with the creative who won the pitch. But he was able to smell – I mean, that creative having that closeness with the client could’ve sold the sky to this client and he didn’t. So I sometimes ask myself what I would have done had I been him. I think that I would’ve said, “You know what? Let’s risk it. Let’s risk it with something that people say ‘Wow’” No, he won but that trust didn’t make him take a risk with a more important and creative campaign. Metrogas and the creative was Metrogas and they had a good experience working together, but what I ask myself is that had I had that same experience with the client, I might’ve risked it. “Hey, if the client knows me, he’ll believe me. Let’s present him something risky.” And it might’ve been a mistake. What he did was, “I know him. I know he would buy something risky from me but I will present something that works for the pitch.” It’s bigger than a normal project because you usually involve more than one team. You usually involve one team in each project – I say team referring to creatives and account people. In this case from the manager to two teams are involved. So time, energy in the idea. It’s very demanding. I would say that I am going on vacation after the pitch. No, most of them were middle-management and I would say that two were higher level. So directors, the rest weren’t. I think that one of the great barriers in creative processes is that you have a lot of meetings and a lot of idea presentations to middle-management people who don’t take decisions. There is a lot of fear in selling those decisions, so there’s a big waste of time in making adjustments to what they think the boss will think and when the boss comes he has a totally different opinion, even changing the brief at times. Think there’s a great waste of – What happens is that I don’t understand how to evaluate that. What I did feel was that on this project, on the side of the agency, there was a big investment in testing and in doing things that required an inversion in working hours, tests, and in finished pieces. We generated pieces, we did animatic. The presentation itself was pretty ambitious, closer to a larger client for a previous pitch. There were resources because the client is very big; there was a lot of money. And part of that tension in the air is that we have built a team that will stay up working till 7 a.m. and talk to each other next day and hug us just the same. We may have big differences, different points of view or how we have to start a creative process and we see that what matters is the project and there’s a trust among everyone. We all respect each other’s work. There are not authority conflicts or managers or directors that impose their position; we have a pretty horizontal position at work, regardless of whether there is a certain responsibility assigned. So that causes us to face each situation, even if we win them, we have the energy – it’s so fun to work together at the end of the day that we are capable of facing another campaign and start from zero working on another pitch. I feel that it’s a failure.

Think there’s a great waste of – Cordial, cold enough not to make the commitment to stay with us and it’s funny but I think there was a lot of acceptance and a lot of expressions that usually don’t take place at pitches. We may have big differences, different points of view or how we have to start a creative process and we see that what matters is the project and there’s a trust among everyone. We all respect each other’s wor So that causes us to face each situation, even if we win them, we have the energy – it’s so fun to work together at the end of the day that we are capable of facing another campaign and start from zero working on another pitch. There was a lot of pressure on this Banco de Chile project, and the pressure didn’t generate not so stimulating things from the account department.",

    "text": "Exactly and in that case we did it for free and it is a project that went well because everything clicked perfectly. For example we got the wardrobe artists, the photographers and all of the people that worked there, and we were like fifteen, nobody charged any money. And they were people that weren’t just from here, they were from production companies all over. And, why do I believe it was a project that functioned properly? Because I believe that it clicked very well, or the idea came together very well with the execution. In what sense? That there is a certain script, I can write a certain script and when you hand it to someone who is going to direct it, it can end up being anything else. In this case since the person who directed it was my partner, I believed that they way the images were thought of and they way they were filmed were totally coherent with they way they were written. A lot of directors accept working for free because when they worked for paid brands they are a little bit obligated to say things in a certain way to work in a certain way and in those cases they are not. It has to do with the freedom of being able to say what you feel like saying, in that sense. Yes, too much. I mean we filmed it in two days but we have been editing it for four months now. You know that they are not going to accept certain idea and you don’t present it or you don’t even think about it, which is even worse. I believe that a lot of the times it is the most important obstacle for a creative, which is to think with certain or too many rules. I mean your own rules but also the client’s rules and that makes for less creativity in general. If you notice for example the idea for Ford, the one with the suicide, the one we were talking about before, it was an idea that we thought of with Sergio and that at a certain point the general creative director, Leo, at a certain point, I mean he always liked the idea but at a certain time someone who I don’t remember who it was said, “No, they are not going to accept that. In the sense that in this case it is like having a client that completely trusts you and that also trusts that you are going to come up with a solution he can’t think about. So then in that sense I believe that those are the best clients because those are the ones that demand more from one. When you have a client you can easily blame, you become mediocre. Why? Because deep down I say, “This brand always says the same, they treat consumers like idiots” so then I think idiotically so then it is like it doesn’t ask you to think beyond that. When there are clients that do demand you think beyond, they are the best but they are also the toughest ones because you demand a lot more from yourself. He was completely willing to try something new, I mean he trusted us at all times and yes, he was very tolerant, I mean he tolerated everything. I mean there was something like that, first of all to not repeat a project. I believe that in this case the brief in this case had a little to do with, I mean the research had to do with us watching all of his previous videos and we also noticed what he had not done yet. I mean there was something like that, first of all to not repeat a project. Yes of course it had to do a little with, I mean in my case I saw the videos that they had before and like they all exploited the same concept. Imagine that in one song, I am left with one idea from the song, and I just make a video with that idea. What we wanted to do was make a video that not only had to do with that but that also respected in a certain way the different meanings of the lyrics, therefore they are several videos in one video and it is not just a video that parts from one idea, and I believe that this video is new in that sense because from all of hi previous videos none did this. I believe that there was a distinction there. You know that they are not going to accept certain idea and you don’t present it or you don’t even think about it, which is even worse. I believe that a lot of the times it is the most important obstacle for a creative, which is to think with certain or too many rules. When you have a client you can easily blame, you become mediocre. Why? Because deep down I say, “This brand always says the same, they treat consumers like idiots” so then I think idiotically so then it is like it doesn’t ask you to think beyond that.   Well, good, they were good. Also know that we worked, we filmed on a Sunday, just imagine there were people from wardrobe, make up, camera crew, people that for example were in wardrobe, and it was Sunday. So that means that the project really interested them because otherwise they wouldn’t have gone, we didn’t pay them. I mean imagine I don’t know if you had worked all week and on Sunday when you can rest you are going to go all day to the street and film. I mean, if you accept it is because you really find it interesting, and in that sense the relationships were really good, we had an amazing time.",

    "text": "None. Because the result was not the expected one. Horrible. Well, very well, they were good. That generates a sort of secrecy that for example even some times the people from accounts are the ones that boycott the idea for fear of the client, I mean, “No, not that idea because they are going to call me on it” like they are not thinking about the agency or the campaign, they are looking out for their job. That happens, and it happens a lot in fact. With planning, with planning they were good because in that case I believe that the problem with this campaign was more than anything on one hand a problem with the people from accounts that also made us choose that concept because there were others that were better. So then a lot of the times you end up doing something with which nobody is really convinced. The results are these, that in the end we do a campaign that might be the one that the client wants but not the one we wanted. But the problem was not with planning, I mean in that case the work we did with them was okay. I mean I believe that the idea exceeded the production we never managed to film what we expected to film and in the end it was a disaster. In fact the client did not accept the commercial in the end, and the producer when we told her she said, “Yes we are going to be able to do that” and they couldn’t it was horrible. I mean if you see it in the end you can’t, I mean they were not able to say that they couldn’t do it, they were not able to say that they weren’t going to be able to do it. And we also committed the mistake of believing that they were going to be able to do it. They were not constant, I mean one day they would say yes to something and the following day they would say no to the same idea. I mean it was like, “I love that idea” and the next day that idea was useless. They had very little trust in our work, they took very few risks, despite the fact that they accepted the suicide campaign, I don’t know why. Deep down I believe it has to do with fear to be creative in a way, and with regarding consumers as idiots, because they are not going to understand. In the sense that accounts was more on the client’s side than ours. It tends to happen, I mean when they people from accounts worries more about the client not being upset than the creation of a creative campaign in general campaigns are a disaster.    I mean, “No, not that idea because they are going to call me on it” like they are not thinking about the agency or the campaign, they are looking out for their job. That happens, and it happens a lot in fact.",

    "text": "The brief was important because we had to create graphics of this that I am telling you about the craving, it was very important for them for the message of the craving to be clear. So then we went through three or four concepts and in the end, as a matter of fact they kept one of the concepts they asked us to work a little bit on the art, we worked on it toward where they asked us and they rejected it. I mean first there are two people and there is one that understands us very well and that likes what we do, I mean first there are two people and there is one that understands us very well and that likes what we do, and there is another one that likes what we do but he is too complicated and he likes to impose his ideas. We have had some problems with him, he is a very insecure guy so then he also depends on this other person who doesn’t matter because he is not the one that decides but we are under the impression that he does take a lot more decisions. But we get along just fine like, “Hey how are you?” and we have a very good relationship but one of them is very insecure.  and there is another one that likes what we do but he is too complicated and he likes to impose his ideas and there is another one that likes what we do but he is too complicated and he likes to impose his ideas.

Good relationship because she agreed with us all of the time and she was very supportive and as I am telling you she agreed with our judgment and our approach.  But of course when the problems started to appear and we began to have some issues with the client, that is when a lot of the times. Well, what is there to do? She became more of a client than an agency, but it’s okay when things are rejected for the second with an important client, it is okay we have to just hand things in and do what you are being asked. , but it’s okay when things are rejected for the second with an important client, it is okay we have to just hand things in and do what you are being asked. Yes well we speak it terribly. No this is not what it is” I mean it was also a miscommunication issue with them, but well we worked a lot with Savory and they are a really good client but sometimes things don’t work. I mean they asked for more work and we did more work and in the end they said, “Okay then” and they presented it to their bosses and the one with the highest rank in Savory and he said no, that it was not what he was looking for. So then more changes were done based on what he wanted and neither, so then he said, “No, I don’t have anymore time I am going to do it with someone else.”   We have had some problems with him, he is a very insecure guy so then he also depends on this other person who doesn’t matter because he is not the one that decides but we are under the impression that he does take a lot more decisions. But we get along just fine like, “Hey how are you?” and we have a very good relationship but one of them is very insecure. In what sense? That we reached three or four concepts that we liked a lot and when this concept appear and we began to work it a little bit more, the three of us agreed that it was the path that we liked the most and also the one that worked best. We all agreed and when we proposed the first artwork, like it didn’t work, I mean we all agreed in a all of the development, and it was good in that sense, we all agreed in general.",

    "text": "So then they sent me to - well I made an art proposal, it was approved and when I went to take the pictures, I got _________with the photographer to take the pictures in a special way and the client didn’t like them, they thought they were very dark and he rejected everything. And we had to do a retake and there were some problems but it was solved in the end. But, it was complicated, I mean especially for me I wasn’t very experienced at the moment. Telefonica del Sur. It was a client that does not have an office here in Santiago so then the conferences were all via video and teleconferences. So then that causes a distancing and they were the typical client who is always right and they treat you like a _________. They don’t expect you to propose much. I don’t know how that client is nowadays but, it was a somewhat complicated client. For them it was a very important project. And this ice cream was called “craving” because it had three different flavors, and we made graphics with different phrases and it looked very nice but in the end the client rejected all of the art we produced. I believe there were three people defining the final concepts, like the final art, two of them had approved them already and the boss said, “No this is not what it is” I mean it was also a miscommunication issue with them, but well we worked a lot with Savory and they are a really good client but sometimes things don’t work. And, in the end I began lending the project to another person because I was busy with other things, not more important but I had to hand it over and that person also had problems and in the end they did it somewhere else. The same concept but with flashier artwork, more graphic instead of a more consistent idea. Like I tried to do something a little bit nicer, a little bit cleaner, I tried to propose something different and in the end Savory aside from the fact that they are a good client they always end up doing the same thing because they already have their way of functioning on the streets very structures. Savory over here in Chile, works a little bit like Coca-Cola in the world, you go to a nowhere town here in Chile and there will always be anywhere you go these Savory posters on the street. It was important but they wanted to spend a little less money than usual, they wanted to do television now and they were going to invest a lot of money in that and so then we just focused on the street and in sales point. So then it was a medium-big project. It did come out in the end but with other artwork, so that is why I was telling you that in my opinion came out very _______. Their risk tolerance was low, in this campaign especially.  It was a complicated client, and I was not as experienced. But, it was complicated, I mean especially for me I wasn’t very experienced at the moment.   Yes I am not very fond of testing, I believe that, well I don’t know. I haven’t had very good experiences and many times the people you test, I test to see and I have also been participating in focus groups. I believe that people who are in that type of situations try to play it smart and they tend to elaborate on their opinions a bit too much.",

    "text": "I get a brief, I read it, if I have questions I go to the account department or with the people in planning and we talk about it in detail. A lot of times I go with my partner or with the art director and copy in charge of the project. We talk about it and from there we go see if something inspiring arises from that moment so we can start working and then I let them work. I, on my own, deal with other things, look at it from different angles. If we don’t solve it at the moment, I go home thinking about it. When I get home I leave it outside my house. That’s how we work; that’s how I work, at least. A project where it all went well? It was with Sabori, ice cream. It was a very interesting project because we had never done it like that. It was a great experience. Our client told us that they had a problem. Each summer, in Chile at the beginning of the year, Sabori launches a product, which will be their great sale of the summer. They had normally had promotion or things of that sort and they asked us what we could think of. We thought about the Top Ice Cream from Sabori, which are the extreme ice cream cones. We came up with two different cones during the summer, and we came up with the idea of them being two cones, we came up with the flavors, their names and everything. We did all the communication; we really did it all. A project where it all went well? It was with Sabori, ice cream. It was a very interesting project because we had never done it like that. It was a great experience. The project was very interesting, it flowed well and the creativity was great. Plus, we were the best of the best in advertising efficiency in Chile that year. No other product sold so much as was as efficient as that one in every field. All other Sabori promotions were surpassed by 500 percent, all their previous sales for the last ten summers in this country. That was very pleasing, having that product and being involved in the client’s business, the way we did it was very gratifying. We worked really hard at it but in the end all of that was transformed in incredible acknowledgements. Very few times had I felt that happy, despite the fact that creatively we didn’t win anything, I thought that creatively it wasn’t a bad campaign but the commercial results were fantastic. I think that was impossible to beat. The project was very interesting, it flowed well and the creativity was great. Yes, absolutely. They were taking risks because on top of everything there was a worldwide concept for Extreme, which we were not respecting. It was a very tight concept and if we stuck to it, we were not going to make to where we wanted to go. So we went outside that box and we thought freely. Sabori took on a risk with that because they have to send this outside and report on what they are doing; but since it was so successful – like everything in life, it sold very well and was very successful so when they reported on it there wasn’t a problem. They didn’t reprimand them, on the contrary, they congratulated them. Had it not been that successful, they would’ve been sanctioned.  I think it said what it had to say. It was open, we had to come up with something because it wasn’t a specific product; something that was the big new thing this summer from Sabori, which sold as much as the previous summer. Those were the standards. It was very open. I think it said what it had to say. It was open, we had to come up with something because it wasn’t a specific product; something that was the big new thing this summer from Sabori, which sold as much as the previous summer. Those were the standards. It was very open. It was clear. I think it was clear. It was open but clear. Plus, we worked almost as a team, that was the best thing. I think that from that day on we achieved a relationship with Sabori that was great. One of the keys in our business is winning the client’s credibility. Once the client believes you can go and sell him anything. So nowadays that client believes us and that’s our ______. There isn’t any backstabbing or anything. We are friends. They were normal, yes. There’s an assigned budget and we didn’t go over it; and the time we took on it was the time we normally take on this type of campaigns. Yes, very good and from that moment on they were even better. After we had an evaluation – Sabori evaluates us and we evaluate them once a year. We have a system called Appraise and after having not-so-good evaluations, I think that was the beginning of amazing evaluations from then on.   In the agency? It was the best period. Very good relationships based on trust. We all respected each other opinions, so maybe the only conflict at the time was that I had a different creative director, who didn’t believe in this idea in the beginning. We presented this when we wasn’t with us, he was on vacation, and when he came and found out what we were doing and that it was already approved by the client and that it was already being produced, he didn’t agree. That was the only conflict but that wasn’t like a bad relationship either. “I don’t agree.” Now, had he been able to reject it before presenting it to the client, he would have done it. But since it had already been presented and approved by the client, he had to go with it. So we went outside that box and we thought freely. Sabori took on a risk with that because they have to send this outside and report on what they are doing; but since it was so successful – like everything in life, it sold very well and was very successful so when they reported on it there wasn’t a problem.

    "text": "It was a pitch, maybe the most important pitch as a business opportunity we have had, which was Intel a great telecommunication company today. We worked so hard, so hard on it. I would tell you that we worked one and half months on it and during the last two weeks we worked Monday thru Sunday up to 2 am everyday. We filmed 20 commercials. We came with 20 filmed commercials, we got everything free, the production companies were with us and we presented it and the presentation was – the success feeling we had was incredible. The client congratulated us but we didn’t win and the most disappointing thing of all was that a client that worked there and then went to work elsewhere told us that we had been the most creative agency in doing the presentation, that we had surprised them, but that our strategic planning was very bad and that other agencies had beaten us on that. Strategic planning is very important for Intel, it’s not just about amazing creativity. It has to be about how are we going to do this later – creativity is not enough, and that was very frustrating. When they told us that we had won it, it was one of the toughest losses I have experienced in my professional life. I was bitter and it was hard for us to get out of it and get our desire to work back. From what I felt they were willing to do something new and take risks. I had Intel in another agency and they are a risk-tolerant brand. They are very innovative in every way so they weren’t looking for the same old thing, besides they had a very specific problem where they needed to take even more risks. It said a lot of things. It’s another role of briefs and campaigns. When they ask you to communicate three or four things at the same time and those three or four things are poorly communicated, at best they are poorly communicated. I think that you have to be clearer and communicate one thing at a time and do it well. People, in the little time they have, are not willing to give away 20 seconds of their day for you to confuse them on top of everything. I think you have to be clearer. The brief was – no, it wasn’t useful. It was complicated to – it had too much information. For planning and for those who like to go into the background and read, read and read, well of course. But it was not a useful brief for the creative sector. It was very hard to come to a more summarized brief in order to have it be useful for creativity. Of course, because that’s what happened. The creative part, according to the client, was spectacular but the strategic planning was not what they were looking for. In particular? No, not so much. I think it has to do with going out in the street, with how people – in this case since it was about phones – speak on the phone or on their cellphone, how they communicated and taking that to resolve our specific problems that were presented in the brief. I think that was part of observation, of walking around. It’s just that it was so much; we spent two weeks where we ate and breathed Intel. I could not tell you about something in specific that inspired us to resolve this. It’s hard. Besides all teams worked on this and that was stressing. I don’t like working like that. An entire creative department cannot be working on a pitch. Within the normal range of relationships that take place during pitches, a good relationship but distant. When you go and do the pitch, the reaction from the client – a lot of people during the presentation – they all have their poker faces on. They don’t give you a lot of feedback. They sort of stay as – what do you call it? Objective and neutral. You don’t see a – it’s not like, “We’re ready.” “We got them, look at how they are laughing.” So it was a normal relationship. Did it affect it? I think that those kinds of things always affect the result, what happens is that it affects in the sense that maybe we took six days doing what we could’ve done in two, but we were happy in the end. Maybe if we would’ve had more time we would’ve taken two days instead of five and it would’ve turned out better. I think that affected the result. Yes. It seemed they were lazy and that they didn’t take risk. They were working for themselves rather than for an agency or a team. The same thing, the same weakness that the people from planning have had all the time since I’ve been here. There didn’t bring a lot to the table. No, accounts are different. They are not incompetent, it’s just that maybe they didn’t distribute exactly – that’s an important problem, they didn’t delegate exact competencies. “Look, you are going to handle this, you this and you this.” It was done backwards, when we had a creative idea then from that moment on they started to write a communication strategy, to look for background information, to do small focus groups but directed to what we wanted to investigate. I think that was done incorrectly. Most of the times they lean on too hard on the creative department, like “let’s see what we do once we have the idea.” It has to be about how are we going to do this later – creativity is not enough, and that was very frustrating. When they told us that we had won it, it was one of the toughest losses I have experienced in my professional life. I was bitter and it was hard for us to get out of it and get our desire to work back. What we found out was that strategic planning was what had been very wrong. That they not been happy at all with that and that was the decisive factor that kept us from winning, that the proposal itself could not be entirely based on creativity alone. t said a lot of things. It’s another role of briefs and campaigns. When they ask you to communicate three or four things at the same time and those three or four things are poorly communicated, at best they are poorly communicated. I think that you have to be clearer and communicate one thing at a time and do it well. People, in the little time they have, are not willing to give away 20 seconds of their day for you to confuse them on top of everything. I think you have to be clearer. No. No. No. It was a long time working on the same thing. It was too hard. What I was telling you about, the last two weeks we worked on it till 2 a.m. from Monday to Sunday. That was too much. We had enough time to make a campaign, not too much but enough time.  I think it has to do with – people inspired us. I think it has to do with people. I think that’s another factor in advertising. In advertising you have to know when they talk about insights and those things, they matter. I think that inspiration is in the street, in the people who use the phone in the case of Intel. Inspiration is in the guy who drives a car in the case of Ford. It’s enough to observe them, ask them and see their behavior and feel that. That’s the inspiration for a lot of things. y. So three commercials I did for the subways that were very successful I saw on a bus; they took place there. The same thing that I saw happening I turned into a commercial and I sold it to the subway and they thought – that was also gratifying for me, to do things that happened on the bus. I think that was part of observation, of walking around. It’s just that it was so much; we spent two weeks where we ate and breathed Intel. I could not tell you about something in specific that inspired us to resolve this. It was stressing. I think the workload took its toll on us. There were discussions, arguments, fights. There were a lot of us thinking about the same thing for a long time. Maybe if we would’ve had more time we would’ve taken two days instead of five and it would’ve turned out better. I think that affected the result. They were also arguments. There were things that accounts had to do that they didn’t do. Besides, at that time, the account team was people who, in my opinion, were incompetent. I didn’t like the way they worked. It seemed to me they were lazy.   No, accounts are different. They are not incompetent, it’s just that maybe they didn’t distribute exactly – that’s an important problem, they didn’t delegate exact competencies. “Look, you are going to handle this, you this and you this.” I",

    "text": "I believe that the projects we have done that have been of most value are the ones that started out hard. I believe that a good project we did was ADO, which is an Olympic sports brand here in Chile that to begin with the clients were a series of, they were, how do you say when there are a lot of people? A council that decided on the campaign. Well, there is campaign in the first thing that I had told you about, about the self-management to come up with campaigns which was something that was important because we won a Lion from Cannes, which was a campaign for Visine, the Visine eye drops that could remove eye-redness. It was an ad that did not have a budget, so then we thought of a campaign that was something, I mean it was complicated because it had to be remembered and it had to be impressive but we did not have any money to do the campaign. But to tell the truth we just paid for this, so then it was something that won the award for best newspaper ad in Cannes and it took a lot of work to do it because the client didn’t want to do it at first, there was no money to do it, we had to, I had to stay on new years eve to launch the ad publishing, alone here waiting to publish but with all the faith in the world. To tell the truth when we got the news I felt like spending another new years eve here. I wouldn’t mind at all. Very small, in fact what they do more than anything is placement on television and very little for newspapers and magazines, they didn’t plan for it. We used it, in that case they didn’t know either because it wasn’t really clear on the brief, it didn’t really state what they wanted because it was a minimum opportunity, it was either that or an Internet banner. I believe that a ________ in Cannes is a good test. No, it was too low. Yes, normal, normal. Very good, good. Yes, I mean it is not that we changed it but they wanted an ad and we generated an alternative media. So then they accepted it because it met their needs stated in the brief. With accounts sometimes there can be differences, let’s say, and the executive we had in that project at the time was an executive that was very helpful in that account but at that time there was a change of executive. So then we faced a person who did everything in order to sell the project and another person that came in with another perspective but he or she didn’t understand that we had already gone with another idea so then she saw it as a personal attack instead of something that was good for everyone. In the sense that planning contributes with insight, with things that can help sell the campaign and in this case from all of the creative reasoning from the campaign that had to do with the publishing timing, which was how we can finally sell the ad? I mean selling the ad and the creativity in the format, which was that people at the time were more exposed to having red eyes. So then they were confident that the time to publish was correct, January 1st which was next day from new year’s eve. So then we had to convince five or six people that the campaign was good. It wasn’t a traditional campaign, it was from the ________ point of view, but it was very audiovisual so then we had to visually show the interior of a person. So then it was a very serious research on how we could do that commercial which in the end was like a ________ of situations. So then everything that we did was coming along very nicely because the graphics were very nice, the texts, the copies made you want to become a sports person when you read them, and well that is it. It is very fresh and we are enjoying the success. But to tell the truth we just paid for this, so then it was something that won the award for best newspaper ad in Cannes and it took a lot of work to do it because the client didn’t want to do it at first, there was no money to do it, we had to, Yes, yes there was - as a matter of fact after what happened here they opened their minds and they asked us for more things. They asked for more projects and also to manage more things from their products on retail. There was a mind opening and I believe that it was because of this event. That is why we were focused on doing something that worked visually more than inventing a concept because there wasn’t any money to generate photographs or anything. They were able to understand when, if we told them that the brief didn’t necessarily have to go in that direction they had the ability to have a different opinion and to generate a new brief to do a better work. Very good, very good. They are relationships where you can - I mean when we finish working we can perfectly get up and go somewhere else, we are like good friends who know how to work well. We don’t see work as an obligation so then there is a self-control for the things we generate, very healthy mentally.   So then we faced a person who did everything in order to sell the project and another person that came in with another perspective but he or she didn’t understand that we had already gone with another idea so then she saw it as a personal attack instead of something that was good for everyone.",

    "text": "The name is Universidad de las Americas. It is the largest private university in Chile, where basically what was the most complicated was that there was a creative work that sought to give a twist to all of that communication that is very homogeneous in Chile. Because all of the universities say the same and they promise the same things, and we tried to make a completely different publicity. And the client was just paying us to generate ideas that they thought were good. So then they pushed aside as creatives and they took us as designers and all of the good ideas were put aside on our computers and everything. We presented the ideas that we wanted but they would say, “Thanks a lot for the effort but we want this” and they would hand us copies of ads from the United States and they wanted to replicate that over here. They were a local client, and the other issue was that it was an account that took a lot of our time and there was a mess with the schedules. We worked a lot for the account but there was little profit. It was very normal to stay from Monday through Friday until three or four in the morning creating ads for all of Chile but our time was misused because we were checking ten thousand ads with different directions in Chile, because they were twenty ads with different formats. They were ideas that the agency did not support because they lacked creativity and they did not set the apart from the competition. I believe that it was a failure, maybe they did meet the objectives because the objectives were clear, they were to elevate the number of enrolled students. But it was too much time invested for us, almost all week, we were physically exhausted and each member’s creative process was stuck because we didn’t need to do a lot of work per say, and we didn’t need to think a lot because it all came to us already done, it was imposed. It was a mess because the people from low rank came together with the medium and high rank people and they would all speak and it was impossible. They would all give their opinions on the campaign, and the owner the man from the highest rank would listen to all of the opinions so then there wasn’t anyone in charge of guiding or deciding on the alternatives. Zero. They didn’t want an innovative campaign just something that was done and proved. The brief was very extensive in the sense that it was a brief for a six month campaign and it did suffer some changes during the period as the market was reacting to it. If not so many students were enrolled then the brief would change. There was even the possibility of doing another campaign within this admission campaign. It was a very confusing brief because it was changing with time, it wasn’t something that was thought all the way through the end. There was time but it was not enough considering the amount of work, but there was money, enough. I mean, what I think is okay you don’t want to accept so then I am going to give you just what you want, so then there was an indifference. I mean the presentations were done properly but without any added value. Planning was a more discrete department, they were not a good department, they were a couple of people that you had to look for in order to get them to hand in the information, they wouldn’t come to you and help. It was a very discrete department, not a very good one. They were involved but they handed in their part of the vision to the client, so then what happened was that the agency worked in different areas that didn’t mix and we didn’t present a direct proposal, they were asked for a different one. It was like working with walls that never allowed us to see each other. ecause all of the universities say the same and they promise the same things, and we tried to make a completely different publicity. nd the client was just paying us to generate ideas that they thought were good. So then they pushed aside as creatives and they took us as designers and all of the good ideas were put aside on our computers and everything. but our time was misused because we were checking ten thousand ads with different directions in Chile, because they were twenty ads with different formats.

There was even the possibility of doing another campaign within this admission campaign. It was a very confusing brief because it was changing with time, it wasn’t something that was thought all the way through the end. That was the most tragic or funny, there were like twenty different campaigns and they didn’t choose any of them. I mean there were two or three months of thinking, one campaign per week thought and executed at a sketch level and they didn’t choose any of them. It was a relationship of - it was a good relationship as long as we did what they wanted. When there was a proposal and we defended that proposal there was even the risk to loose the job or to have trouble with the boss. I mean, it was a very indifferent relationship. You hand me the ideas and I will deliver them because there is no possibility to deliver you anything else but what you ask for. They were bad because there was a conflict between the creative director and the partners because there wasn’t a - the creative director wouldn’t dare to ask the owner of the agency for some work warranties, like for example not staying there too long or the work being excessive. So then that generated like an environment of dissatisfaction. We were not satisfied; in fact a lot of us left the agency because of that.   With accounts the relationship was very bad because it was like having the client in our house. It was like working with the orcs there. It was like working with walls that never allowed us to see each other.",

    "text": "It was a very rich experience and we had a very small budget. It was just placement and the website and that was it. The doll sales were dramatic, but what happened was that we sold the doll until we did this with the doll but all the products like castles and such things didn’t cause – well, those are a lot harder to sell. But that is something of which I am very happy. It was tiny project. They were very – I mean I didn’t expect – we had knowledge that it could work because Internet here is very – what happens is that promotion was basically online. It wasn’t through text messages. It was harder for children to reach, so in terms of the mechanics they took risks. They could’ve not gone online and nobody – now the mechanics of the communication is very well tested because we always make the same mechanic and it’s the effective one for kids, but the it was pretty hard and they were taking a risk. They said, this is going to work but it took us six months to do it. They were very confused at first with the how and this and that. Then they later wanted to take them to the zoo instead of the Bahamas Island and we had to convince them a lot and – I think we could have had a bigger budget for the prize. They trust us. They give us the freedom to manage the resources they give us, as we best think fit, while of course having these restrictions. They tell you that you cannot do anything online unless it is linked to another website, that the main communication focus are placements so we tried to do other kids of placements that were more strange. For example, like I tell you, one of the placements for this promotion was that two of the characters from the TV series were in the classroom and the teacher is teaching a geography class and she would say, “Well, there is an Island in the north called Bahamas Island which is surrounded by dolphins and nature.” And one of the kids would say, “Oh, maybe Barbie could be there. Yes I think that we could go look for her. Let’s look it up online and on the map.” So they were not traditional placements. They were fun to watch and they let us do that. They take risks. She’s an Argentinian, Paula. It was hard because they sort of – my partner was a man and this was clearly a very feminine project, so he was a little reluctant at first because it was Barbie and everything. So I would try to explain to him how dolls worked and little girls’ relationship to dolls, and he was like “They are all crazy, this can’t be.” But then he sort of found it interesting to create fun things, but at first – and we were both just starting so for anyone who is just starting it was like – Of course, now if I get a product that is very masculine I think I won’t know what to do.  It was okay, but it could’ve been a lot better because they didn’t press the client to tell him, “This is really necessary.” I think that is very important as well, not to press them to take a decision but to give them a small push. I think we were aligned, and the entire team focused on the same thing. We all knew what the idea was and we liked it and we wanted it to work. I think there were some coordination problems. The client took a long time to decide this and therefore everything had to be rushed in the end; it could’ve been a more easy-going project, even when at the beginning I told you that time was okay. It was okay, but it could’ve been a lot better because they didn’t press the client to tell him, “This is really necessary.” I think that is very important as well, not to press them to take a decision but to give them a small push. They supported us in understanding the target and in seeing how to solve the awareness issue. We were able to manage it appropriately. Time was also okay. In that project it was because we started working earlier; then when they took the decision it was kind of a rush because of an issue with dates, independence day and – but it went well. We did it and it wasn’t stressful. The story. We were inspired by the movie and in the role dolls have for little girls. They are the projection of themselves. They see themselves as princesses. They see themselves as a veterinarian, a doctor, they see themselves with the boyfriend and that’s why they’ve had to come up with movies and everything   They trust us. They give us the freedom to manage the resources they give us, as we best think fit, o I would try to explain to him how dolls worked and little girls’ relationship to dolls, and he was like “They are all crazy, this can’t be.” But then he sort of found it interesting to create fun things, but at first – and we were both just starting so for anyone who is just starting it was like – I think we were aligned, and the entire team focused on the same thing.

The profiles – because we were just – we weren’t just being introduced to the brand but to understand what type of promotion could work, what was the role of the doll, what’s the process girls go through, why are there groups of dols for certain type of girls? So they sort of explained more what the interaction the kids have with the toys.",

We presented 30 scripts. 30. We were working for three months and we had to go and make the commercial in one week because it had to be on-air right away. Everything was a rush, everything was terrible, everything was ultra-tested, we had a bad relationship with the testing agency, so they tested everything wrong. The questions that – I would go to the tests and accounts would go with us and the creatives did as well and we would see that they liked the commercial and they would say, “No, but in reality they really don’t like it.” “But they are saying they love it.” “No, but it’s not what they say because you then psychologically analyze what they are saying…” It was all wrong. . The brand manager of Trencito is incredible. His vision is like this, 360 degrees and the guy is incredible but his boss is tragic.

He’s the sort of people that don’t give a personality to the brand. They want to see the giant product because the product is gigantic and otherwise people won’t see it. For example, he once told us, “Do you know what? What I want for the commercial is to have a group of kids at a plaza who are talking about how incredible the chocolate is.” So that’s the commercial he wanted to have. The degree of frustration with that project was incredibly high. Having presented 30 scripts of which, by the end of the process, only one was approved and the boss said, “No, I don’t think kids will like this.” “But we tested it.” “Yes, but I don’t think they will understand it.” “But we tested it; they loved it and understood it.” “No, I will think they wont.” None. It was terrible. “You might like…” “No.” They budget was – it’s complicated because I think they gave us a lot of time but the decisions were taken – I mean I think we had six months to work on the commercial but out of that we spent five months thinking because they didn’t approve anything, so in the end you look like a failure because you can’t present something that is logical. I don’t think any of the commercials we presented was something that I wouldn’t have liked to see on TV. So I think that the time they gave us was good but it was very badly distributed. I can tell you that script number 30 inspired us. What inspired us? I think there came a point where we didn’t know what to do. We had ideas for everything. I am telling you that we presented 30 scripts but those 30 scripts came from 90 ideas before  Experience. Something very personal for me, I am the oldest of all my cousins and I have all very young cousins. I think I went to their houses every weekend to see what they did, how they moved, just to get an idea. I think that we read a lot or at least I read a lot of planning studies because Nestle does a lot of children studies and I think that we got a lot of ideas from that about how the moved, the environment where they moved, what they were thinking, what they liked, what they didn’t like, why there was a commercial they hated and why there was another one that they liked a lot. We were very careful with that because, for example, we discovered that they are very critical so that in half of the commercials they try to put a character that looks cool and has that cool stereotype, sort of a jockey with ultra big sneakers and uses a skateboard, and it’s not like that. The little kid cannot relate to that, so discovering who was really that kid in the class and remember ourselves when we were in school, but trying to get there in those studies and in our own experience. We also went to the streets. I remember that by the end of the project it was impossible to be in a room in here and we would take the entire afternoon and go to Providencia for a cup of coffee and just observe, “What if we do this? And if we do this other thing?” And we would see the kids go by and we tried to do those things because it wasn’t flowing anymore. I think we got along very well with the brand manager. I think that the other one has a certain personality where he needs to impose himself. Do you know what? He’s that type of people that has to see the negative in everything. It’s not that they are really wrong, but in order to impose his authority they have to be wrong. That’s my perception, of course. So he didn’t justify – his vision was very subjective and that is very complicated for the relationship because we tried to be very objective beyond us liking the ideas, we showed him references and everything and he understood but he was very subjective. So by being subjective he didn’t give us space to respond because in the end in came down to “I like it” or “I don’t like it because I like it or because I don’t like it.” There wasn’t any other answer. So with him it was a very complicated relationship, with the brand manager, Felipe, nothing, perfect. I think that the relationship with accounts was very hard because I think that the client was pressuring them a lot to have the project done, therefore account pressured us a lot and there are things that you can’t rush. If they are asking you all day long about what the new script is, you’re like, “I have presented 10 scripts and I need to go somewhere else to think because I can’t think of anything.” And they were like, “What do you mean that you can’t think of anything.” So it was a very tense – “No, but it’s not what they say because you then psychologically analyze what they are saying…” It was all wrong. Everything was a rush, everything was terrible, everything was ultra-tested, we had a bad relationship with the testing agency, so they tested everything wrong. o we couldn’t move forward and we tried to sell the idea and then – in one of the meetings when we were on script number 15, for example, he said that we would come up with commercials and just stuck the product on the back, like with a bubble gum. So that is very insulting for us because you take the product as the starting point. So the second time he said something like that I got really mad. I love the product we came up with. I love the commercial, but I think that Nestle has a very archaic vision of advertising. You see the reel of Nestle commercials and they are all the same; they are very pretty and the entire family is happy and it’s perfect. It’s about perfect couples and perfect children. For them kids never rode a bus, never touched the subway, and they do millions of tests and then they don’t care about them. I think they are very scared of innovation and for example the client in particular – the brand manager o He’s the sort of people that don’t give a personality to the brand. They want to see the giant product because the product is gigantic and otherwise people won’t see it. For example, he once told us, “Do you know what? What I want of r the commercial is to have a group of kids at a plaza who are talking about how incredible the chocolate is.” So that’s the commercial he wanted to have ittle kids – and we made him a commercial like that with little kids talking and they said, “Hey, have you seen the new generations?” And the other one would say, “Yes, and now they go online and play on the Internet. In my time I would play ball.” They were little kids talking, “Yes, have you seen that now instead of drinking their milk they eat it?” Because it’s solid milk, so the other one says, “Yes, I don’t know what we are coming to.” So it wasn’t as boring but because it was a little shinny and the product is not…” We felt like hitting ourselves in the head with a bat. he degree of frustration with that project was incredibly high. Having presented 30 scripts of which, by the end of the process, only one was approved and the boss said, “No, I don’t think kids will like this.” “But we tested it.” “Yes, but I don’t think they will understand it.” “But we tested it; they loved it and understood it.” “No, I will think they wont.” “But we tested it.” “Yes, but I don’t think they will understand it.” “But we tested it; they loved it and understood it.” “No, I will think they wont.” He said, “No, I don’t think they’ll like it. They won’t like it.” “We tested it.” “No, no.” “But we have all the graphics.” “No, they won’t.” What can you do? None. No risk-tolerance at all. Zero. I mean I think we had six months to work on the commercial but out of that we spent five months thinking because they didn’t approve anything, so in the end you look like a failure because you can’t present something that is logical. I don’t think any of the commercials we presented was something that I wouldn’t have liked to see on TV. So I think that the time they gave us was good but it was very badly distributed. We had ideas for everything. I am telling you that we presented 30 scripts but those 30 scripts came from 90 ideas before. Experience. Something very personal for me, I am the oldest of all my cousins and I have all very young cousins. I think I went to their houses every weekend to see what they did, how they moved, just to get an idea. He’s that type of people that has to see the negative in everything. It’s not that they are really wrong, but in order to impose his authority they have to be wrong. That’s my perception, of course. So he didn’t justify – his vision was very subjective and that is very complicated for the relationship because we tried to be very objective beyond us liking the ideas, we showed him references and everything and he understood but he was very subjective. So by being subjective he didn’t give us space to respond because in the end in came down to “I like it” or “I don’t like it because I like it or because I don’t like it.” There wasn’t any other answer. So with him it was a very complicated relationship   Good. I think that there were a lot of contributions that helped us move ahead with the project because then it all was done in a rush and we needed the support from the entire team, much more than just the partners. We needed everybody to get in on it because we needed to support that particular project that week, and we all went to the shooting of the commercial and we had a great time. It was very fun. “I have presented 10 scripts and I need to go somewhere else to think because I can’t think of anything.” And they were like, “What do you mean that you can’t think of anything.” So it was a very tense –",

    "text": "Well, the lead client on it was Singaporean, so he felt that because he was actually Asian that he knew a lot more about Asia than we did and he was very pedantic and he was like every little decision- I guess one of the reasons why this particular one is one of the favorite examples of something that went really well, is every single thing that we did here that concerned with and brought up, but we pushed back on every single one of the things that he brought up and we won more than we lost and we ended up with something that was hugely successful and everybody was happy with. but we pushed back on every single one of the things that he brought up and we won more than we lost and we ended up with something that was hugely successful and everybody was happy with. It was probably one of the most difficult processes to manage and get through but the result of that was what made it to mull it back and go, “Yeah, that was great”. I think we were able to manage him in a way that he listened. He was already receptive to a creative idea from the beginning, so that puts you in a good place where at least he was doing an ad that he wanted to be doing so it wasn't like we were pushing on that. In that particular office that we worked in, everybody really was career focused and reverse focused on trying to do the best work possible. I think that's very similar to what we've brought here as well but so, it was the team spirit in terms of wanting to do the best work we possibly could. That particular group of people are a tight-knit group, like we're all still really good friends, so that carries through the- I'm talking about Cam and Tom. They sort of backed off and let us manage it and they were on the same team, I mean they had the same goal that we did and it was clearly a priority of the agency to get the work through and to defend it. So, they did come on board and helped out a lot. But with that particular project, when it came in, it came in as actually point of sale posters and then store displays and the client wasn't really sure what they wanted, so we walked away with a brief and my creative partner and I at the time worked on it and working on the projects we had other ideas that we thought would work in viral space, and what ended up happening was instead of making poster or press ads, we ended up making half a million dollar TV spot that went on and started on as a viral campaign because there wasn't media behind it, and then it went all the way through Tiger Beer, through that network and ended up running in New Zealand, Australia, North America and the UK. So, this little project that was sort of, you know, nobody was really looking at, turned into something much bigger. And that just shows that ideas don't have to come off briefs and if an idea is great enough it can have a life of its own. Just the beginning of a brief doesn't mean that the limited put in place are necessarily an absolute. I think just looking at Asian culture and trying to find a way that was relevant to West- like trying to take something that was inherently Asian that Westerners would be able to identify with and tapping into that. I mean they had the same goal that we did and it was clearly a priority of the agency to get the work through and to defend it. So, they did come on board and helped out a lot. They were really good about once the idea had gotten through about, you know, pulling back and letting the creatives sort of take over. And instead of bringing issues, they sort of came with solutions, which is sort of getting back to what I was talking about in terms of a good environment to work where it's not obstacles, it sort of ways around obstacles, I think that's important for a success of an agency. think just looking at Asian culture and trying to find a way that was relevant to West- like trying to take something that was inherently Asian that Westerners would be able to identify with and tapping into that. The whole idea ended up revolving around reincarnation, so that was something that as a Westerner, I think most Westerners have an idea about reincarnation being a big part of Buddhism and Hinduism and all that kind of stuff. So, that helped to drive the creative idea. Well, the lead client on it was Singaporean, so he felt that because he was actually Asian that he knew a lot more about Asia than we did and he was very pedantic and he was like every little decision- every single thing that we did here that concerned with and brought up, but we pushed back on every single one of the things that he brought up and we won more than we lost and we ended up with something that was hugely successful and everybody was happy with. But he always wanted to offer the really authentic Asian point of view, which is great but we're also talking to a really broad audience. Didn't always matter if there weren't the right amount of people in a Chinese restaurant.",

    "text": "I think there were several key issues and this one was the expectation of what was achievable at the beginning and sort of when it first came to us, it was, you know, you can do anything and the reality was much further when we went into the initial talks with [inaudible 00:19:02] and when we went to the brief and everything, it was like, “Oh we need a 360 idea”. Where the client's expectation was to do just do couple outdoor posters ... Barely even that. It was more almost like point of sale, they wanna see a massive shot of chocolate bar. It was a really, really narrow minded point of view where we were sold in on actually something much broader that we've been doing. And basically what we come to find out is that we're targeting young males, so we came about all these different ways of actually going about it but in the end, what the client really wanted was half naked women and that was the perv power, so that had to stop and power although we were looking at the market, and it was almost a divide between like a 60-40 split between women and men in the target but it was all sort of young guys and like a more senior older guy on the business. And so, then there's food porn, which is we wanna see the product and we want it to be massive. So, something that started as, “Alright, we need a brand idea and we need something in order to kind of have a platform for consumers to interact and kind of hit them across multiple touch points” turned into how do we incorporate the beautiful woman in a scantily clad outfit and a massive shot of the product. So, once we kind of got over that hurdle and said, “Alright, well”, it was break the boredom, was the idea that we had and it was girls with power tools cutting the bars or drilling into the bars and being sprayed with chocolate or that sort of shit. So, we went down that road and every time we would go down that road with the client, they kept pushing back and being like, “The dresses need to cover up, we need to do this”. And it just turned into real- it was a really interesting experience and once we finally got the photographer in, they ended up being pretty amazing shots and the client just continued not to listen to us and just asking us to make the product bigger and bigger and bigger. So, it became just the biggest shot you've ever seen a candy bar and a girl who doesn't actually fit into- so she was half the size of the candy bar, standing next to it. In the end it didn't really end up being very useful, no. Cause' the initial work that went off that was on strategy and was on answered that single-minded proposition but then where we ended up was had nothing to do with that, so I guess the brief sort of went out the window, probably about half way through the project. I think the creative team- everybody kind of- the creative department sort of handled it as best as they could and I think the accounts service handled it as well as they could as well but it sort of out of our control and although I would say that you'd want account service to be driving that and really bringing the client back in, they were such an unwavering client that I can't really blame accounts service. It was just sort of one of those situations that ends up happening in advertising where you just have to ride it and try to do your best to get to a good result. But it will always be compromised, so you just try to get to the other end of it. I think there were several key issues and this one was the expectation of what was achievable at the beginning and sort of when it first came to us, So what they initially asked for the two [inaudible 00:19:45] of the brand that they were asking for was perv power and food porn. So, coming into this, it was a little like, “Well what the hell is that?” So, that's where their head space was at and ours was like, “Well here's an opportunity to do something really clever” and we didn't think we had to go down a more base. So, then what ended up happening with the project is we compromised on that and everything continually kept being compromised and we still tried to steer away from being cliché and we still wanted to try to target the female market as much as the male, so [inaudible 00:21:49] said, “Alright, we'll try to do it like if Gwen Stefani design clothes for these girls, what would it be and how do you make them really cool, like space age stuff so it isn't just really cliché”.  So, it became just the biggest shot you've ever seen a candy bar and a girl who doesn't actually fit into- so she was half the size of the candy bar, standing next to it. Strained. They didn't really listen very well. So, there'd be things where we were talking about design or we were talking about hierarchy, things that we're actually specialists in and it was just sort of like, “Yeah, but make it bigger or we don't care, make the background red”. There was just zero listening.   it sort of out of our control and although I would say that you'd want account service to be driving that and really bringing the client back in, they were such an unwavering client that I can't really blame accounts service. It was just sort of one of those situations that ends up happening in advertising where you just have to ride it and try to do your best to get to a good result.",

Simplest idea ever, and it just sort of really lost its way through the whole creative processes, and it was one of those ones where it wasn't, the reason I am so disappointed in that one is because I feel like we could have actually made it better ourselves, I don't feel like anybody came in and screwed it up, it wasn't the client screwing it up or anything like that, we just sort of lost our way with the idea and it didn't come out as great as it should have been. It started as a really good script, and then the director came in, who's a great director, but we were a little bit more junior at the time, and so he comes in with all his points of view and we figure, well he's a director, we should listen to that. And then you also listen to your creative director, and we started listening to too many people, and not holding really tightly to the idea, and I think it just sort didn't end up what it should have been. I mean, they bought, again, they bought a really good script. We just screwed it up, that's what's so disappointing, is that, usually someone else screws it up if it's gone wrong, but that time, it felt like it was us. Trying to remember. Was actually a really simple, really good brief, really well written, but it was just one simple proposition was that the camera's Weatherproof, can withstand rain and all this sorts of things. Very strong, that they have, the sort of one, at that point in time, there was like one really difficult person over there who's the sort of product manager. He's the only person from the client side that I think hurt the ad as well. It was mostly us, but, as an agency, but what. He doesn't, they've been working on a lot over there, but he doesn't understand the idea part of the advertising, because he comes from a really technical product background, so he understands pixels, and you know, the body of the camera, the dust filters and all that sort of stuff, but he has no understanding of an idea, so you know, wanna throw this part in here and this part in here, and not understand what that does to the ad   Well, that was Andy and I, and I mean, the relationships were, our relationship's good, but I think amongst everyone else, it was imbalanced. Their relationships were imbalanced in terms of some really senior people, and us being a little bit more junior, and not throwing our weight around enough.

PROJECT ID Well, yeah, I mean, our creative director at the time, he was fantastic, but he was, you know, he's the most imposing personality and the director is also, you know, he's been directing for 20 years. So just the experience levels more than anything. We'd only been working for five years at that point, and they'd all been working 20.",

But I can't say that that added to everything though. It's just nice people. And they seemed to trust us and listen to what we're saying and that was sort of switched on as well. They weren't afraid to, sort of go `Oh God no. We have to do it like this?` They were ready to hear what you had to say. So that's cool. I don't know for this specific project, it got tense at one point. But that was pretty much it. And I think that was more between like production and service not communicating and about getting it out on time and that kind of thing. So it wasn't really the creative. And while the client had lots of restrictions, we had to use the doggy lips. We knew that from the beginning and basically worked with that and it went pretty smoothly. We had a lot of media to cover with it which was, kind of, one of the problems to start with but worked out really well. We had to still do that [inaudible 00:01:33], the really big ones. So then, everything had a separate style as well so we had to shoot to that. That was something to around, but the client was just awesome all the way through it. Made such a huge difference. It was pretty low actually. 'Cause I mean they said they wanted their dog in there. So it's kind of like - came out with some pretty cool campaigns for a tough camera which is an awesome proposition, but then I said we had to have the dog in there because they became attached to the dog last year or something and it had to be used all the way through. So that kind of like brought it down a bit, the use of light because there's only so much that a dog can do. That kind of narrowed it. So we kind of, pushed the grade on it and tried to make it look as cool as possible. Because it could've so easily just been like a flat image of - you know. Boring dog and that kind of thing, but we managed to work out okay. We did like - we pushed the dog as far as it could. So we made the dog have personality and it was kind of like, cool 'cause it messed up this whole room but the camera was fine. So that was our concept. And you have fun with that. And so we had like, a picture of it with the camera in it's mouth and like, shaking it all around so it really became like an art original thing other than anything else. So that kind of like brought it down a bit, the use of light because there's only so much that a dog can do. That kind of narrowed it.   They weren't afraid to, sort of go `Oh God no. We have to do it like this?` They were ready to hear what you had to say. So that's cool.",

    "text": "We just had a really bad relationship with the client side. They didn't seem to mind the creative so much. It seems like things would get filtered down from upstairs that would just - just came down as just incredibly rude. And so you'd be like `Whoa, why are you talking to me like this?` And then sort of go back out and, sort of just silly things like - it didn't turn out to be about the creative. It was like, carrot sandwiches in meetings and just stupid stuff going on, and it's like `I just don't have time for this.` So. I mean, there's always disappointment. I think when we first started working on HSBC, that was one that we really really liked to push a lot further. 'Cause again, it's a cool brand. It's a big brand. There's lots of money, but somehow it always ends up - we just end up doing shit just because - it just - I mean, work comes from client but I don't what that country's service or client or whatever. But it just gets sorted down as kind of boring and there's so many mandatories. And there's so many things that you have to do that, there's just very little scope to go anywhere. But it just became really boring. We had this cool idea of covering bus shelters so they looked like houses and the inside of houses, but it just got forced down, forced down because they were worried that no one would get it. So in the end, it just became so basic that all the enjoyment was lost. All creativity. I don't know. We never met the client. So, that was a weird thing. Well we wanted to do something different. We sort of, had full use of any medium that we wanted so that shelter seemed like a really cool idea. And it would have been. But, yeah. Yeah, apparently. Yeah. We didn't actually really get very much feedback at all. Get this kind of job done and move on to the next one. It seems like things would get filtered down from upstairs that would just - just came down as just incredibly rude.

Brief was okay, but I mean it's barely even like a brief when you get one of those ones cause it's just - it's full of mandatories. And even - I mean - I don't know, but again. It comes from client and account services really, a proposition that's just going to advertise out of homeland. Yeah. It's just, heartbreaking. (laughs) Well again, we don't really know them. We met them once in like, a radio station and they just came in and told us we needed to put tents in it with the other legally mandatory things so - that was all that we know of them. I don't know about the upstairs either and I can't say there's - I think, they have a sort of dodgy relationship with them, probably not the best. But it seemed to be buddy-buddy, we can get anything though for you kind of thing, so.   Things got tense on this one because again when things get filtered down through client and you hear them and it just doesn't quite sound right, you wonder how much is sort of getting translated before you hear what you have to do. So that's kind of annoying.",

All right, we just finished a Thrifty billboard stand which was a productive idea that myself and Adam were working on and it started off as a really loose, basic idea and we didn't actually think it had too many legs but then we pitched the guys and it kind of grew and grew and grew. And as far as it went well, because we did it on the fly. We took some chances and the chances came off and then on the day everything just fell together and it was one of those times where you did plan a lot but you also were very lucky at the same time. It just so happened that everything went click click click and it came out well. A very simple job that could have gone horrendously wrong but actually it worked really well. So that's one that went well. I think from my point of view, a common factor of things going well is being prepared as much as you can. You can never be prepared for anything but if you try and think of every [inaudible 00:03:24] reality, things are more likely to go well and things are more likely to grow out of that as opposed to not having any planning and trying to ... Yeah, if you just start out the day without any prep you're in trouble. But if you start with prep, you can still win and make things up on the go which I think is a big part of creativity where you get a lot of good result out of it. But having that background if I try this, this and this. I think that often results in a good outcome. My training might be different than these guys. I come from a product design training. It was always drilled into me that you do a lot before hand and think laterally about the problem as opposed to the outcome that you're trying to get your information. And I think that's, it's almost opposite to how advertising ideas tend to work whereas it's a very loose and unrestrained. For them, it was a minimal effect on if it didn't go well it wouldn't have been detrimental to their brand but if it did go well it would be a positive so they didn't have too much of risk at all. Well from what I can tell they let us do a lot of creative thinking outside the box which isn't defined by a strong brief as opposed to someone like Kellogg's is another big client who have a lot of research to back up all of our work and there's probably 10 times the decision makers sitting around a table trying to evaluate an idea. Like Thrifty, it's very fluid. We've got this idea, it fits with you, it's very fluid.

They were comfortable in leaving us to evaluate the situation. Having a laugh basically. It seemed like a fun, I think it was one of those relaxed conversations where an idea comes out and it's like, this seems like a good idea. It wasn't anymore than that really. Well from what I can tell they let us do a lot of creative thinking outside the box which isn't defined by a strong brief as opposed to someone like Kellogg's is another big client who have a lot of research to back up all of our work and there's probably 10 times the decision makers sitting around a table trying to evaluate an idea.

Throughout the course of the project, the two teams separated and we were concentrating on the celebrity idea to appease the client while the other team developed other ideas. We all had, there was no animosity between the teams but eventually it turned out that all of our ideas were killed due to a marketing decision further up the chain so we wasted a lot of energy early on developing ideas that ultimately didn't ever have any chance of going anywhere.

The brief started off being good but it got muddy and unclear as the project went on due to internal decision makers. The goal posts were moved slightly in terms of what you were focusing on so that was- I think this project we had internal review which the CD's couldn't attend and we pitched all our ideas and it went down very well and I thought well you've cracked it. And then we had to pitch those ideas to the Creative Directors. It's interesting, at the start of the meeting I think my partner mentioned that the suits were very happy with these ideas and I think that triggered them to talk the opposite stance and the CD's said no we don't like any of these. Now it would be interesting to see what happened in that circumstance if we said nothing and then pitched the ideas.

    "text": "On the other hand, which was exciting because Kleenex, we've changed the brand. We changed a 15 year brand for one T.V. spot, which was interesting. Normally it's all about fluffy ducks and being happy and cutesy-wootsey you'll see in wallpaper advertising? But with this one we decided with people, it's all about facial tissues and people crying, and I don't see how fluffy ducks is going to help with this, so we had intense moments of people like ... really sad moments. And we've got this really deep montage of this happening, and the brands gone to that direction, instead of fluffy ducks, and stuff like that. Which sort of changed everything around the world, or it will eventually, so that's another one I'd say has been pretty positive. A lot. There were too many chefs in the kitchen, because we had management restructure going on at the time, creative direction restructure, so everyone had their input. So that was like ... we had three creative directors on it, which was really intense. We had a managing director on it, we had the Kleenex management on it, and then we had global management overall for the brand, which that would be T.V. org and everything because they just did not have the spot that was in a different direction of it. I wouldn't say it was the most innovative, it was just different from their brand. Wasn't very innovative, it was just a T.V. spot, but it took a 12 to 15 year brand of one direction, and we just flipped it to the other like, almost a depressing direction compared to happiness. So I mean that's what we just ... we changed their brand. Yeah, they didn't realize what was happening here, I don't think people understood the bigger picture of it, until it went overseas and then they were like, `What have you done? We've invested 15 years of a brand archetype wheel. And now you've gone here for one T.V. spot. You've changed the whole brand overnight. What have you done?` So we didn't realize the big deal of it until ... They wanted to capture what the moment was, the Kleenex moment that requires a Kleenex facial tissue. So I think they wanted us to go with the direction of time, when your son kicks a soccer ball and you're so proud of him. No, we were like no, we'll do the moment where someone learns how to walk for the first time since his car crash. Or someone's father comes home from the war, or something like ... it was all about the moment, we just made it more negative moments, than the clichéd moments. Just to do something creatively different, and just something different for the brand. It seemed like it's a really global brand, and it just seemed like a nice change. Different piece of communication for the brand. I mean if you're going to sell tissues, you're going to try and do it realistically, the idea is that facial tissue are to make people cry, so let's try and make them cry in the T.V. commercial. t was pretty tense, because we had an acting ... we had a freelancer here who used to be the creative director, so he thought he was in control of the project. And he did not get on with one of the clients, one of the main clients. He was one of the three marketing managers, and one was a woman who did not get on with the creative director and they hit heads and, yeah that wasn't very good. It was pretty tense, because we had an acting ... we had a freelancer here who used to be the creative director, so he thought he was in control of the project. And he did not get on with one of the clients, one of the main clients. He was one of the three marketing managers, and one was a woman who did not get on with the creative director and they hit heads and, yeah that wasn't very good. But the rest of them, the main client, was really excited by this new concept, this new area. He's done, I think 60 adverts for Kleenex over 30 years, and he said he's never seen anything like this and it was a new direction for the brand, and something amazing to be part of and stuff. And they were more than willing to put in an extra one hundred thousand dollars into the T.V. production in the end, which was a huge step for them. So they must've trusted us a little bit. It was pretty tense, because we had an acting ... we had a freelancer here who used to be the creative director, so he thought he was in control of the project. And he did not get on with one of the clients, one of the main clients. He was one of the three marketing managers, and one was a woman who did not get on with the creative director and they hit heads and, yeah that wasn't very good It changed a lot because the team changed a lot as well. So it was me and someone else working on it. We came up with the concept and then those who were freelancing would overseeing it, and then he sort of took control of it, and took it to an area that we disagreed with, therefore we didn't work on it with him. Then the client had a fight with him, and then he left. Yeah, the account people didn't really help us much. Those in creative ... didn't really help us with the creative argument. At the one point where the client was wanting to back down from the advert we were trying to do, the accounts people in our office were siding on with them saying we must do what they want, which we found very upsetting because it was deterring from the original idea. Sometimes you question who they work for, the client or the agency. And then back when these guys got involved, the new creative directors, and the area changed to a direction we wanted it to go, but the suits, the account executives were back on our side, but I didn't find them too helpful to say the least. `What have you done? We've invested 15 years of a brand archetype wheel. And now you've gone here for one T.V. spot. You've changed the whole brand overnight.

Or someone's father comes home from the war, or something like ... it was all about the moment, we just made it more negative moments, than the clichéd moments. No, it was too broad, and we really ... people are upset with the direction we took to begin with, because they said it's negative, and it's not happy and stuff, and it was a very broad brief, it could've been about anything. And then ironically, in the end they liked the idea and they came back to it and said they wanted that idea. But the brief wasn't very helpful in the beginning.  So they must've trusted us a little bit.   and then he sort of took control of it, and took it to an area that we disagreed with, therefore we didn't work on it with him.

They loved the idea from the beginning, making sure of the presentation, we had the room designed to get them in the mood for it and everything. It's about a bar, kind of blokes, kind of boys to men thing going on. Guys who really don't care about getting their feed, getting their meal. So it's like blokes on the go, men on the run eat this bar, we don't really care what's in it, we just eat it because we're men. So it's going to be funny. So we did this whole thing about headlines, like you know, it was really funny headlines, real blunt headlines like, `Food, 10 out of 10 doctors recommend it`, and some other stupid kind of stuff, it was really funny. Like the kind of stuff that kids would find funny, teenagers. Yeah, the media people didn't book their media properly, the account planning didn't fill us in. They must have known as well, they did know, they just didn't tell us to stop working on it, so we did that all good. So yeah, that department should've been communicating with us more I'd say. Media should've been communicating with them more, or with us more, and the client should've been telling us also, from the get go, that, `We didn't have a media space for it, sorry`. Instead of us spending a thousand hours developing it, which is pretty silly. Because it would've been really interesting for Kellogg's, like Kleenex-y kind of thing. It would've been really different for them. At the end of the day it was just a series of posters that was going to be run and billboards and stuff. But the brand hasn't been advertised before, Sunny Bright, so this would've been their first launch. So I'm just saying, it's a big deal, but it's not T.V. or anything, it was only posters. Was better than ... it wasn't that good, but it was okay. There was just a bit of lack of communication going on. And they loved it, and then we were off making it, hundreds of different headlines and posters. Because they're very headline driven we had to design them really nicely, so we got a really good designer on board, making them and then they just canceled it. They said, `sorry, the media isn't happening this year`, and they canceled it. And then, they did it again three months later, they said, `No, it's back on, let's get ready again`. And then they said, `No, we want a new direction`. We went a new direction again, and then they went, `Oops, sorry, can't do it anymore`. So that was just pretty like, `What the hell?`. Media should've been communicating with them more, or with us more, and the client should've been telling us also, from the get go, that, `We didn't have a media space for it, sorry`. Instead of us spending a thousand hours developing it, which is pretty silly.   Whereas most Kellogg's things don't reek opportunities, there's really stunk of opportunity, we could do something really fun with it.  There was just a bit of lack of communication going on.",

Jane and Andy were very adamant that we could sell this idea to the point that were literally saying that this is a great ad, it could be great. So it's great to have that kind of leadership from the beginning. The client very slowly came around, with a lot of reservations, but when we got the director on board, Paul Mandich, which is probably one of the best directors around, that then kind of gave us a bit more kind of look we know what we are talking about. At the end of the day the ad was pretty good, and all the things that came out, and the response so far has been pretty great. The client very slowly came around, with a lot of reservations It was hideous. I've not yet seen them react that way, or not heard of them react that way since or before. We literally were saying, get rid of the dog, and their whole products. It's almost as if I was to say to you, lose the energizer bunny, and that's how they saw it. They said, you can't. The brand is the dog. I said no it's not, your product is what it's all about. So yeah, there was a lot of adversity, a lot. To the point where they were going, nah, nah. The briefing when we got it you mean? We got it a week before it was due. Everyone else had a crack at it and we were put on it at the last minute, and they said look see if you guys can do something. So yeah a week is a lot to do, for a brand like this, both Jane and Andy wanted something really good. Mark's twin brother was the client The relationship was pretty good, we knew we had at least one of the decision makers not being in favor of this but willing to hear us out as opposed to going nah nah nah nah nah. But one of the key decision makers from Olympus was very adamant that they couldn't lose the dog entirely, so we just at least have him in the van in part of the script, so he does link a little performance, and it's quite nice, but he is definitely not the, the focus of the ad. Creative team or... Ah, You know, having a week to crack a big brief is not a lot but once we came to them with the idea, we literally said, it's so tough it's like nothing ever happened, they got it. Mark and myself have a great relationship, and we have a great relationship with Jane and Andy, but once we got to the point, they said yeah great, let's write it up, and we had a script and that got to it so, we've never, I've never had a problem with that point of the process at all, no, it's good. With Olympus we're likely because we have probably got one of the better account guys on it Pete Boz. Once he saw the idea, he was yeah we will sell it, and he was on board all the way. So from, I suppose, from the get go, he was there saying, okay, if we are going to sell this thing we are going to have to show them, just wear them down. Whatever they come up with we have to have the finances for. So having the support was key. Simple things like explaining to them that you don't need to thinks still in the eighties or nineties and having and mnemonic device to sell a product. You know, like apple just go, look it's cool and people buy shit loads of it it you know. And what we're saying is, ours is tough, you can break it and it won't break, you know, it's unbreakable. And they go okay. So we came in with a strategist laid out.  But one of the key decision makers from Olympus was very adamant that they couldn't lose the dog entirely, so we just at least have him in the van in part of the script, so he does link a little performance, and it's quite nice, but he is definitely not the, the focus of the ad.   It's almost as if I was to say to you, lose the energizer bunny, and that's how they saw it. They said, you can't. The brand is the dog. I said no it's not, your product is what it's all about.

It was a cracking idea so it wasn't something that was part of a proof which was something we thought was really nice and presented to the client. Immediately sort of fell in love with it and they said yeah, do what you need to do to get it done.   It was just an idea we had. We were playing around with what could we do. Award season's coming out and we thought, well, we need a few cool ideas to go up and we just went sort of through the client list and one of them was Schick. We thought, alright, when was the last really nice piece, nice, fresh, original piece for razors and I don't know, we couldn't remember anything exciting. We thought, just played around with different ideas, and then just came up with the ice re-surfacing. That was it basically. It was good in that we presented the idea, Ann and Jay immediately bought it, said that's lovely, and then we cut it upstairs to the contractor responsible for Schick. He sold it on the same day. The client said yeah, let's do that. And then we just kinda sourced a few, all the ice rinks in Sydney, Australia. Found a contact, they were happy for us to use their Zamboni machine and yeah, that was it.",

    "text": "It was just a medium that's never really been used before in Australia so everything from sourcing supplies ... there was only one supplier at the time who could wrap a handrail and they were in a phase where they were sort of experimenting with stock and with printing techniques and all that sort of stuff. There was no money involved. There was no real budget. Again, it was a proactive idea so it was just trying to pull a lot of favors, getting people to buy into the idea, love it, and then sort of ... We were lucky because they were just starting up their own company, the escalator people, and they were willing to kind of cover the costs. We wanted to do it first down here and we just were on a deadline and they couldn't commit. Then we had problems with one of the people, like the client didn't really want to put any money behind it. We shot the food all ourselves. There were so many delays with the actual owners of the shopping center. We wanted to do it first down here and we just were on a deadline and they couldn't commit. And then we went from this shopping center to the next shopping center and back again and then back to another shopping center. And we had to find a place that needed to be one of the conveyor belt ones, otherwise it wouldn't have made sense. Then we had problems with one of the people, like the client didn't really want to put any money behind it So it was just a really, really lengthy process. And then when they first installed it, it was actually, this stop lasted for about a day and then started peeling off. So they had to de-install the whole thing, put it up again three or four weeks later. Then the print was just kind of skewed and all distorted. So there were just so many little headaches we had with this. Because it was also a new medium, it was just, you can't really rely on experience or anything, it'd never been done before so it was just prototype thing. These are just the things that go wrong. Yeah, just a lot of headaches and a long, laborious process. They didn't do really ... it's hard to ... I'm not sure risk tolerance is the right word. They just ... because it was something new, they couldn't really imagine what it would end up looking like. They were a little wary, so I don't know. They were a little skeptical but when they saw the idea, they said okay, go for it, which was great. Because we went through a lot of companies. We were actually looking for a client. Because they were down in World's Square, we just sort of struck a relationship with them and found out who the market manager was and then kind of talked to him. There were a few other ones on the radar but it just ended up being this one because they had just enough, they were kind of big enough which gave us the option to go to different locations if we weren't able to get the escalator handrail media up and running, so we were able to go somewhere. Which essentially is exactly what happened. We planned it for World's Square but the World's Square management board didn't want commit. They said, it's on the radar but it could be weeks and months down the track. We wanted to get it up and running before Christmas. That never happened. First one was a bit rocky. Communication was really, really difficult. Their command of the English language was a bit limited at best. And they weren't really forthcoming with supporting us financially. They were willing to give us a little bit of money but it was a drop in ocean, it was nothing. So yeah, it was really, really hard at first and then we kind of got another client. Same company but a different person, a manager of the other branch, who was a lot better. But overall, it wasn't easy. The language barriers, I think. it was just, you can't really rely on experience or anything, it'd never been done before so it was just prototype thing. These are just the things that go wrong. Yeah, just a lot of headaches and a long, laborious process. Yeah.   hey were a little wary, so I don't know.

    "text": "One that springs to mind is the Kleenex TV commercial I made a few years ago. And I kind of vowed never to work on the product again, because we were sort of led to believe we had our heads and we could do something creative and I'm not sure if it was such a disastrous project because we were mislead and then felt betrayed, and from then on we just went looking for proof that we were being betrayed, every day and got more and more Found more and more proof and every step became... every step became another obstacle, and the obstacles just because bigger the more that we did. But generally it was, yeah have your head, have this idea, here's a few perimeters to work to, but it turns out that we really didn't have any hope in hell in doing anything we really wanted to do. It was like a bit of a rouse to get a storyline out of it, and once the storyline was in place, all of the other mandatories could be locked in and controlled and right down to the color of the background and right down to the size of the font. It was just totally managed by the client and the internal management system, and we were pretty much just turning up and being told what to do. And I don't think, I'm pretty sure... because it's got a puppy in it, you talk to people outside of the industry and they say no that was fine, that was a great ad, isn't the puppy cute? So I don't think they really noticed how the edit didn't really make sense, how all of those things we're trying to make work, probably tells us a good ad is coming out, none of those were quite working. It was very clunky, the graphics weren't quite working, so maybe I was just tainted by the process and the ad wasn't actually as bad as I thought it was, but it wasn't a great deal of creativity involved in the storyline in the end. About five. There was about five, but I remember a lot of the decisions were left up to the two junior people who seemed to be doing everything they could to impress their management. Just making as many comments as possible to impress somebody. I'm not sure if it was such a disastrous project because we were mislead and then felt betrayed, and from then on we just went looking for proof that we were being betrayed, every day and got more and more- But generally it was, yeah have your head, have this idea, here's a few perimeters to work to, but it turns out that we really didn't have any hope in hell in doing anything we really wanted to do.

It was very dictatorial, there wasn't very cooperative. I don't know if it's just me, but I don't really function well when I'm asked to be creative and then told how to be creative. So yeah, there just wasn't a lot of collaboration. It was just lots of we know what we want, just give us what we want. It kind of pushed us together, we sort of... yeah it probably helped our relationship I think, as a team, because it was kind of us against them really. So it solidified us and I noticed we started to find other ways to find other creative outlets, probably through comedy and whatever, just having a general joke amongst ourselves to make it all not so serious and lighten it up a bit, which is a good thing. They weren't nasty, but they weren't very solid. We really just didn't have much to say or much to do with them really. Once we realized it was do as you're told, there wasn't a lot of communication, like if you want to kill a relationship, just don't communicate. That's what we were trying to do, I think subconsciously.   Yeah, we just got a sense of they didn't care, they'd moved on, they didn't have to worry about it anymore so there really was no communication.",

But yeah, from a creative point of view it was lots of fun and we thought it was successful, the creative heads around the world in the JWT network agreed that it was good work, they rated it on our creative rating system quite highly, and yeah so for me that was one that was quite successful. I supposed you hear a lot of comments that too many cooks are spoiling the broth in the advertising industry and stuff, and the fact there's a lot of overthinking of stuff before it even gets on the table. It's kind of we want you to think in this direction and don't really stray from there. I don't know, maybe I'm just jaded about being in this industry about 10 years and I feel quite constricted about what I can do and then when you do come up with something that gets you excited, it gets over analyzed and internalized and the thing that keeps the screen that people see is generally something that's been waves and doesn't really make a lot of sense anymore. The relationship's were really good, they enjoyed the process and I think they were actually quite excited about doing something a bit out of the box as well. There was a mixture of excitement and nervousness I think. I think they were kind of... it sort of felt like they were in unchartered territory for a while there, and not really... because there wasn't a process anymore, it had become a creative thing that we were just sort of winging a little bit towards the end, trying to get the right people. There was a lot of discussion and angst about were they too out there, do they look too weird, just generally trying to manage something that was becoming more unmanageable by the day. It's a little bit of nervousness I think. Planning was interesting. They were excited to be part of the project, and I felt like they were playing both sides of the fence really, really gunning for it to be really different but then trying to placate people who were a bit nervous about it. I think they were kind of caught in the middle, to be honest. They're probably quite ballistic thinkers and that's how it felt, they were just trying to appease everybody and still get the best result, really.

It was a very broad process that we had complete control over. There was no real influence in the way, which is quite good. There was a couple people looking over our shoulder, but usually, especially where there's clients going, shaping you in different directions. Global gave us money to make this concept, so it was quite easy to go through. We got to do it how we wanted to do it. We kind of mapped it out ourselves, I guess. It was a very broad process that we had complete control over. There was no real influence in the way, which is quite good. There was a couple people looking over our shoulder, but usually, especially where there's clients going, shaping you in different directions. So this was good. Ended up being funny and different and original, and we didn't have anyone to tick the boxes along the way, if you will. Yeah. There's a guy that came ... It was a retoucher from Singapore who came over who had just invented a soft drink, and he just released on the market. It was quite a cool concept. It's called Whatever and Anything, and it basically came from his idea that when people go to get a drink at someone's house, someone goes, `What do you want to drink?` They'll go, `Oh, whatever.` You know. You can't really decide. It's all too much, so he basically came up with this concept that's six different flavored soft drinks, but the cans are identical. There's nothing on the can to give away what flavor is inside, so each time you buy a can from a shop, you essentially don't know what flavor you're getting. So he played on the whole ... It's more of an experience than actually buying a product, which is really quite cool. Very high. I think because they're a small company, and they want to make a big impact, and their product is quite different and unique, and because they have a limited budget, they were happy to do something that spreads by word-of mouth. If you have that can machine, you're gonna go, `Oh god. I saw this bloody weird thing today. It was quite cool.` So I think they were pretty keen to do something risky 'cause word-of-mouth costs nothing. That's one thing that triggered us to be quite open about it 'cause he briefed us with more talking about his product, talking about his company, and he was quite excited about it. I think you get excited about a product when someone's passionate about it 'cause you don't feel like they're sitting there going, `And we've been told to do this, and this is what it is, so come up with something good.` But if there's a general level of enthusiasm in there, kinda, `We did this and had this idea from this, and people didn't want that.` And you kind go, `Oh cool. I can see.` It's addictive when someone's passionate about something. You want to do something cool. No. We wanted to do something ... I think a lot of people there did print campaigns and TV campaigns, and we were, I think ... the whole benefit of that product, or the whole difference that product offers is not in the actual product itself. It's in the experience of the product. We never got to taste it, but there was six different flavors. I'm sure they weren't any good. I'm sure they were your typical supermarket dodgy flavoring, but that's not the reason people went and bought that many cans. It's a bit of a novelty to go and buy a can and go, `I don't know what flavor I'm getting.` It's kind of cool, like the whole lucky dip scenario.   We got to do it how we wanted to do it. We kind of mapped it out ourselves, I guess. It was a very broad process that we had complete control over. There was no real influence in the way, which is quite good. here's a bloke who's on all fours on a hospital bed. Doctor's got an x-ray, and he's got his hand in a big latex glove, so he's about to ... and this guy's stuck something up his bum, or he's got something up his bum somehow. So you're actually reaching into the can machine to pull something out of his bum where the hole is over his part of the body, which was quite cool. but he was happy not to have any influence on the final decision. `And we've been told to do this, and this is what it is, so come up with something good.` But if there's a general level of enthusiasm in there, kinda, `We did this and had this idea from this, and people didn't want that.` And you kind go, `Oh cool. I can see.` It's addictive when someone's passionate about something. You want to do something cool.  `And we've been told to do this, and this is what it is, so come up with something good.` But if there's a general level of enthusiasm in there, kinda, `We did this and had this idea from this, and people didn't want that.` And you kind go, `Oh cool. I can see.` It's addictive when someone's passionate about something. You want to do something cool. And that led us to doing something not around a typical print or a TV or a radio ad. It was something like, how can we heighten this experience? Let's reach people when they're actually going to get the drink and make it even more interesting and make them think more about, `Oh wow. I really don't know what I'm gonna get.` One of our things was a big picture of a magician holding a hat. So they reached into the hat and grabbed it because that triggers in their head, when a magician pulls out, he never knows what he's gonna get. So it's playing that up.",

But, again, I think the conflict between Creative and Account Service comes from there being details coming from both sides and them having to deal with it in the middle, this, kind of, us having no input, so it was fine, she was really kind of just an admin role, I guess, saying this has to be done and this has to be done. The truth, how many times do you go to, like a milk bar or where you get something, you go to get a burger or something and you look at the foods they've got there and there's fifty different drinks, and you're like, fuck!   Difficult dealing with the photographer and re-touch up because they are in Singapore. Me and my partner can be very cheeky and sarcastic, just joking around, I doubt that just kind of [sound effect] a lot of the time, so we found ourselves, `no, we're joking, we're joking.` It was very funny.

    "text": "So essentially the idea was, if you're going to stare at this small... your eyes are going to start playing tricks, and that was the crux of the campaign, which would have been really cool to do, but just like TV stuff, or this guy sitting there typing late at night and staring at the fan for a second, and then suddenly the fan breaks off and spins around like it's a little flying saucer and it's going to land on the desk and two dudes get out and steal an orange and an apple and go back in and fly back up, and he's looking up, or you don't know that's a fan at the beginning and it just lands and goes back down and goes in the fan and he's just, like 'What the fuck?' But the whole idea, the big thought and could have gone anywhere basically. We had it, what we thought was all sorted, we went in there with a recommendation and it was just not enough about the product benefit, and they didn't believe us that tired eyes can play tricks. But maybe because it had aliens in it. But I think the reason it probably bombed is because it wasn't close enough to the facts they wanted to get across, it was making an interesting ad to get people into that fact rather than using that fact to drive someone into the ad, which can often be quite boring and dull. There is a client there called Sanda, who didn't like it. Back to the drawing board. We presented one once that was, 'Listerine brings you to life.' It had these clowns, and it was all about pouring... this kid pours this Listerine in this clown's mouth, at the sideshow at the carnival. You know those clowns that have the [inaudible 00:07:01] but there's four of them attached together, and they all wake up and started walking around as four of them. And before he even finishes, it was like, `Oh, no, I don't like clowns.` Sorry? `I don't like clowns.` Yeah, if I don't like clowns, lots of others do, I don't like clowns.` I think, I've obviously heard, whether, for people, will they find it interesting enough, because we are just telling them something new, or do we have to do something to engage their attention to tell them something new. In this case, I don't know That one we came up with, I think, because we were working quite late on it. It's kind of cool when you are working on something and living what that product benefit could be. Because we had been at the office quite late and we were, 'my eyes are fucking with me.' That's quite interesting, because when you stare at your computer that long, you're going to start making mistakes, and you're going to start wondering if your brains start drifting off a bit. So I think that's one of those ones where it happens to you, I guess, very often [inaudible 00:10:59] They are all right. I'm quite friendly with a couple of them there. This one lady we didn't get along with her too well, it feels very 'us and them' sometimes, with J&J. I don't feel like they feel that we're helping them, rather we're trying to slip something [inaudible 00:11:21] under the radar. I don't really feel like that can go hand in hand. I want a client that laughs and goes, 'Oh it's great, I love it, but we'll never do it because they'd be too scared.' It's like, personally, it's really cool, but I'm representing the big company and that's not what we do. But Stan's cool. I don't really feel like that can go hand in hand. I want a client that laughs and goes, 'Oh it's great, I love it, but we'll never do it because they'd be too scared.' It's like, personally, it's really cool, but I'm representing the big company and that's not what we do. But Stan's cool. This one lady we didn't get along with her too well They were all right. It was a bit, I think it's been a new Creative Director's style, so there was more, a bit of 'trying to impress these guys' this is always how that works. You don't know how they play, and what kind of people they are, so you're trying to, through the credit reviews, trying to suss it out what you think is good or not, and then not exactly doing what you would think would be great, but trying to mold it to what their expectations would be. So especially when you have four Credit Directors or lots of Credit Directors in two years, so you've got to impress them every time they come through. `Oh, no, I don't like clowns.` Sorry? `I don't like clowns.` Yeah, if I don't like clowns, lots of others do, I don't like clowns.` Too many. There would have been three or four. A local client. And then I think with J&J how it usually goes, it goes up to a regional client and then up to the big cheese who, they run it across his desk, if it's gone through everyone else, and if he's in a bad mood he just goes, 'No.' That's how it kind of works with them, I gather.   'my eyes are fucking with me.' That's quite interesting, because when you stare at your computer that long, you're going to start making mistakes, and you're going to start wondering if your brains start drifting off a bit.

You don't know how they play, and what kind of people they are, so you're trying to, through the credit reviews, trying to suss it out what you think is good or not, and then not exactly doing what you would think would be great, but trying to mold it to what their expectations would be. They're good. As far as the Account Service goes here, they are one of the better teams. Their boss is really good, it's not a matter of, 'we've got to please the client,' it's like 'give me what you want to give and I'll find a way to sell it,' which is great, I think. Obviously, you are [inaudible 00:13:10] that thinks you've come up with a problem, didn't tell certain clowns, but he's good, he's really good, I get along with him very well.",

    "text": "Yeah sure, I always look at the outcome of a project and to judge it. For me, I don't care what I go through as long as the end result comes out good. So with Sheridan Sheets, they make bedding and stuff and we had just won the account on an idea that I had worked on with another art director that had moved on, so when it came down to do the ad, we've done one ad with them, TV and print and it went really really horribly and the outcome was horrible. So there was a lot of how is this gonna go sort of thing, and it was for their premiere line and they're just launching it, and it just went really really well. We took it a much different way than what they... the way they did the other ads, and it was very theatrical the way we set it up, and the first meeting with people and showing them the ideas, they knew the ideas because these are the ones we won the account with, but I went in with some revisions, because we've set a stage, we actually made it with a stage from a play or something like that. And all that was in there and stuff and they really bought into it, and from there on out there was a lot of niggly and they would just go for funny stupid little things, but in the end it all came out really well. What other things do you want besides that? Really really tense because we had such a bad... I say that because it went really smooth, but we went into it quite tense because the first job had gone really really poorly, went horrible. So there was a lot of apprehension and people on eggshells, but the client has a tendency to put us against them. Even in photo shoots, they're in their camp and we're in our camp and they were... and they did a lot of that and they saddled up to the photographer and if a photographer, they sit right in front of you so the photographer can't really liaisons with you about how you see the shot, it's sort of like him and the client talking about... It was a little bit frustrating at times but in the end we got the shot we were after and the tenseness made it's way through. Good, good. Yeah. Sometimes... I don't know what the other creators are saying, but you must know there's such a warm, and I never... I haven't been in advertising that long but the last position I had was with a different company and it was much easier and since I've moved here, I was in Nike in Hong Kong for a while, I started to see the real anxiety and then I moved here and it's just a real battle between... And all that was in there and stuff and they really bought into it, and from there on out there was a lot of niggly and they would just go for funny stupid little things, but in the end it all came out really well.

That's when it started going horrible by involving all those people and starting... the CEO at the time was a real yeah let's do that, but I like this. I gave them three ideas and she liked all three. I want to combine all of them, I want to do them all, you know what I mean? So it was combining things that didn't really need to be combined and it made it difficult. Do our credentials, make them look better. So in the end I gave them concepts for not just making it look better, because they changed... after they gave me the first brief, then they gave me another. They just kept going like this, so in the end the CEO had this new idea for a different kind of deal, so we went along that line and she saw what I did and she wanted to include that in her concept and make it so anyways, it just got bigger and bigger. So sorry what was the question on this? So it seemed useful and certainly I got to do what I wanted, and in the end it didn't really veer from what I wanted to do, but they put in so many different things and then it just became too big, they wanted too big and no one would sign off on it in the end, so that's probably another question. Good, yeah. As much as there was animosity, especially near the long end of it, it went on for months. So near the end, I was just getting... it would just keep coming back and someone would send it to Melbourne and some secretary wouldn't like it. So it was getting frustrating, and I[inaudible 00:17:57], but it was good, everyone gets along. That's when it started going horrible by involving all those people and starting... the CEO at the time was a real yeah let's do that, but I like this.

But they became the worse client I've ever... I worked on that thing for- Like as in where everyone had... because not only were we doing it for us, but it was for all of the Austral Asia, Australian New Zealand, so you'd have people in Melbourne making a say on certain things, people in New Zealand, and people here. Do you want me to get really dramatic and say well 14 people.   then it just became too big, they wanted too big and no one would sign off on it in the end, so that's probably another question. There was... As this... As it's off the record, as far as anything I've done, just the creative director at the time just wouldn't, he just let the circus sort of go on, and I was just walked into the agency and I got in the middle of this circus, he should have put his foot down a little bit and told the CEO and the MB to back off a little bit and just let us do our business.",

    "text": "So the way we started off is a [inaudible 00:09:51] writer and a art director said it's not about copy or it's about art, it's about the idea first. So once the idea is there then the copy and art sort of just fall into place. So we were concentrating on the idea first and we had a lot of ideas and nothing was working. There are some times when you just have a lot of ideas but it just doesn't seem right. You say, `No, it's not right, it's not right`. So we tried and we tried and nothing was coming and we had three options which were like safe options. It's an Indian NGO that basically looks after children. And, it looks after the health organizations that look after them. So it's like this mother of organizations. So we were working for that. And in India a lot of people when we get married, they tend to give us a small donation to some charitable cause. This is a [inaudible 00:14:37] we just came to a small [inaudible 00:14:39]. So CRY wanted a place on this market. So wanted to send out a mailer to brides and grooms who were just about to get married. So that's where we came to [inaudible 00:14:53] and said, take a direct mailer to get to them. Make them donate to us, CRY. And the idea that [inaudible 00:15:55] had was one of these last two ideas that we had chosen. And then we just, you know then my art partner does the art and I do the copy. Then we put it all together and send it out the client to approve the one we wanted. And then they mail it out. Though I don't know whether this was effective or not. Because we didn't get feedback from the client. Sometimes, it actually depends whether you ask them. Sometimes we don't ask them so they don't give us feedback. Sometimes they give feedback but it doesn't come down to us. Because creatives aren't actually people who are dealing with the client. So this thing comes in review. So now it goes through ... Sometimes it might get lost. Sometimes. Only sometimes. Time was, we had about just for conceptualization, we had about three days. Which was fine because we were only working on those kinds of flat pack. But it was tight because it's a flat pack. So we couldn't spend much. But then it's an NGO so you expect that. Yeah this was among the ideas that we had explained. This wasn't like the last time it just came out of nowhere. But they were like I said, when you see an idea you just know inside. So this was one of those ideas, and just hard to like pass. You take this away. I didn't deal exactly with the client. But the servicing person was there and he kept talking to us. Okay, they liked the idea but they were just wondering whether it would be as effective or not.   So we spoke to them, we got more, you know what are the things of why children aren't going to grow up both of the parents and economic situations and everything. And then we started to sit down and think of a different way in which we could create an ad that would obviously stand out and get some recognition within this competition as well as mean something. And we had a lot of ideas initially. If nothing came, then these were the options that we're going to go with. And then on the last day, this Monday before we were supposed to submit this entry, in the night we go out me and my friend and we're just having a drink or two and suddenly we started sketching some ideas on some tissue paper. And that was it. We got the ad then and there. So we went home, finished the ad. In the morning we came and submitted it. That was that. It just came, it wasn't ... We were again really given up, but then suddenly the ideas came. Which was perfect. I don't know if you can call that luck or just perseverance or what, I don't know, but it just came, which was nice. So wanted to send out a mailer to brides and grooms who were just about to get married. So that's where we came to [inaudible 00:14:53] and said, take a direct mailer to get to them. Make them donate to us, CRY. They were good. But then, all of us were around the same age group, so we'd just go and just hang all out together after work too. So it was quite a good relationship.",

    "text": "Okay I worked for this car client, that I worked on when I was in Singapore. It's an international client with a lot of restrictions. As in the ads, you can only do it with the visuals that the client has in the database. All the visuals are only of car pictures that are shot from different angles. We were working with them and whenever we did a visual it was don't bother with a new idea. Just go to our database for the visual. And then there's an A3, there's A4, there's an A6 and there's an A8. We should go ask for these [inaudible 00:24:12]. So A3 is catered to a certain audience, A4 a certain audience, so on and so forth. So the lines were written basically on that audience, or for that audience. And they would just put in the visual, and that's your ad. I actually worked really hard on their ads. So that at least their standard because that's the only thing that is different or that can be worked around a little bit with it, just a car visual at the end of it. Irrespective of whether it's a good wager or not, it's just a car. So you can show the car in so many landscape, and then what? So the visual for us, it got to be a bit boring because we used to see good visuals of cars all the time. So the line, going to mean that we work very hard for that to work well. So we used to work hard on the lines, but then eventually I wasn't very satisfied because the idea is just in the line. And then it goes onto the body copy. But the visual is just like a support [inaudible 00:25:17]. And it'd be better if the visual and the line worked together very well. And you know it was an idea that started the whole thing off. Not, I had the visual and I just had to write a line to make it work. So it was not really nice.   Well there were but for these ads it was small. We just had to follow the same [inaudible 00:29:04]. There was a great [inaudible 00:29:06] bottom of it. But then a lot of things come in from, I don't know where Audi is internationally, and then we just had to follow them. The visuals we just can't advertise, because they couldn't afford to shoot everything, it's too expensive. So I guess they use the same visuals from the database. Money also, that's very tight. I always try to get a small [inaudible 00:30:52] regain the copy and photo visual that there is. I try to [inaudible 00:30:54] the car by use of background or I still use the scenario of the whole picture. So I should make sure that the line was as close to the visual as possible. But that is work to get me to select certain lines, say, `I think this is good` and then send it for approval. They know it's just the line, and the visual has to be a nice visual. I'm sure there are some bad visuals hidden within the database. But there is not much you can do about the visual. There's stuff from [inaudible 00:32:03] and ... But the line, [Soshi 00:55:57] knew that the visual's there, and we know the line has to work with the visual. She was the [inaudible 00:32:14]. We were working with them and whenever we did a visual it was don't bother with a new idea. So the visual for us, it got to be a bit boring because we used to see good visuals of cars all the time. So the line, going to mean that we work very hard for that to work well. So we used to work hard on the lines, but then eventually I wasn't very satisfied because the idea is just in the line.",

    "text": "Okay. In that case, a campaign we did for Kit Kat, which is a print campaign. I liked that project because the brief was, “Have a break, have a Kit Kat,” and it's the most classic tagline ever. How do you re-interpret that idea? It seems like everything has been done for that before, so there are a lot of restrictions when it comes to big brands like Nestlé, like Kit Kat, in terms of the number of years they've been having certain requirements when it comes to an ad. In this case, we had a classic brief where it was re-interpret or express, “Have a break, have a Kit Kat,” in an interesting way, but you must use the snack device, which is the break, you must obviously logo, use the tagline, and must reference a situation that you are having break from. Already from a print point of view and a creative point of view you've got like all these tick-boxes, and how do you come up with a fresh idea based on that. It was a brief that I worked with another three guys, and we had all struggled with it for weeks. It was one evening we just kind of stopped thinking about it, and we had a few beers, and we just ... I mean, I can't really tell you how the process happened in terms of the idea creation, but it was a very low-key guy kind of evening where we were just drinking beers and really talking a lot of crap. From there we kind of just started to talk about Kit Kat, but not in the sense of trying to meet the brief, but thinking of weird ideas. It was because we were in a relaxed environment, and we were having fun with it that we actually came up with an interesting way of executing it. For me, that's probably a project that went well, because despite the struggle, just through collaboration and not thinking about the project as much we actually came up with an interesting execution on it. That's probably one that I can think of recently. I think, from the client point of view, they like to be seen as accepting of creative ideas. Whether they are truly open to the ideas, I'm not sure that they necessarily are. I mean, if you put onto a scale, I think they are willing to buy-in to creative work. This particular client was willing to buy into creative work. I'd say a six maybe in terms of being open. I mean, it is easy to do work that the client likes, but for us we've always been trying to push the creativity on our biggest clients. Those are obviously the most rewarding ones when you manage to crack it, 'cause Nestlé is a massive client, and they are not easy to get good work through. Especially for a product like Kit Kat where it's got such a strong heritage, to be able to actually add something to it by come up with something original, I think, is more rewarding than doing something very creative for a product or a brand that's not very well known. Because, if you've got a new product, it's a can of soda or something like that, you can do anything, because nothing has been done, there's no comparison. So, for Kit Kat, it's one of those things where it's a bit daunting because good work has been done, you're trying to do justice to a very classic tag line. Yeah. It was one of those ideas where we all instantly knew that it was a winner, and we felt very strongly for it. All four of us were like, “this is it.” I think in terms of ideas that we present to our creative director, we showed him more than one, because otherwise he would be like, “What did you guys spend all your time doing?” We did show him other ideas, maybe three or four ideas, but we concentrate on doing this one a little bit more finalized in terms of doing a scan, drawing it up, making it look how we perhaps envision it. 'Cause we wanted to sell it. Then, obviously when he saw it he knew that was the right way to go, and it was a matter of just pushing it to the client saying, “We've got a fantastic idea and we think you should run with this,” and he saw it and it's very hard not to like it, because it's very Kit Kat territory, yet it was done in a very different way. Actually, even though it is a very creative idea, he bought into it very easily. Always open to good work, even if the work is initiative work where we've wanted to push a different angle to a brief that they've given us, they're open to it, whether they buy it or not is another issue, but they're always willing to accept work. If you call up and say, “We've got some great new ideas for you, would you be interested in looking at them?” They're always willing to actually ... I think that most important thing for a client is to actually be open to ideas, so at least you've got one hurdle down because a lot of clients are just not open to them, so they're just like, “Yeah, you've got good ideas, but I don't really care 'cause I don't need them at the moment.” It's nice to have someone that says, “Yeah, sure,” whether they can do it or not it doesn't really matter, it's just the fact that you can approach them, so at least they're receptive to them. Good. I mean, in terms of creatives we had three writers and one ad director. That's not the normal kind of mix, I mean, usually you're working in ad director-copywriter team, wherein this case we were just jamming ideas and that's what we came up, and it doesn't really matter if you're a copywriter or an ad director, it doesn't matter what your title is. I think for us as well especially [inaudible 00:25:24] tried to not make titles depict the type of work that you should be doing. And, in this case, it was a very visual idea, and then you got three copywriters coming up with this sort of work as well. Secondly, whether they like it or not, which is personal, but everyone is allowed to have their opinion whether they like something or they don't like something. In this case, obviously, we met the brief and he liked the work. It was an easy sell for him, and he liked it, so he was passionate about the way he sold it as well, which does help. You need to have everyone on board when you're trying to sell work, because it does come through in terms of how a client reacts to work is when there's a lot of passion there, I think they can sense it. It was because we were in a relaxed environment, and we were having fun with it that we actually came up with an interesting way of executing it. For me, that's probably a project that went well, because despite the struggle, just through collaboration and not thinking about the project as much we actually came up with an interesting execution on it. That's probably one that I can think of recently. The brief was a classic Nestlé brief in the fact that it had a lot of requirements and mandatories, and usually that is the killer of any creative idea, so in this case we really had a lot of check-boxes and we knew it was one of those briefs that is gonna be tough, it's not going to be an easy one to crack. You can either make the decision now to have a very painless process and just do a classic pack shot for them with a nice line on it, you could go the easy way out for sure. It's a bit like when people get Nike jobs, and stuff like that. You obviously want to try and live up to the expectations that a lot of good work is being done, and to go above that is always the challenge.   Then, obviously when he saw it he knew that was the right way to go, and it was a matter of just pushing it to the client saying, “We've got a fantastic idea and we think you should run with this,” and he saw it and it's very hard not to like it, because it's very Kit Kat territory, yet it was done in a very different way.

And, in this case, it was a very visual idea, and then you got three copywriters coming up with this sort of work as well.",

    "text": "I would say the work came out with really with no idea, there was no concept to the work, it was just pictures of the golfers, and a generic line on it that said, “Catch the best women golfers in action at HSBC Women's Champions.” For me, I think it was just a very average kind of idea, obviously expected. A lot of the reasons why I don't think it went well from a creative point of view was that there were way too many people involved in the project, there were too many restrictions from outside sources such as the talent management people, the International Golf Association, not sure what they're called, but people that are not related to the actual industry from either agency point of view or client point of view. There are people that have just got an opinion because you are using professional golfers, and that actually had a huge impact on the type of work that we created. Okay, in terms of media and the budget that they woulda spent on this, it would of been one of the biggest for the year for HSBC. It had multiple media touch points: it was TV, it was print, it was outdoor, it was everything, it was direct mail, it was hotel room dress up, lift lobbies, branch stickers. In terms of the scope of work, it was huge, which also makes it very difficult to come up with an interesting or creative idea because in general they like to adapt the work to everything and to give it a consistent look and feel. As soon as you have a requirement like that, the work can become very generic, which it did. I wouldn't say that it failed to communicate to the public what this was about, I mean it didn't fail in a communication aspect, it just didn't really live up to a very creative idea. You've got to look at both of them when it comes to ideas, because they are obviously that can do both, communicate and be creative. Then there are ideas that are too creative and don't really get the message across. In this case the message was clear, but average message. Because I'm not sure as to how many product groups that they would have got approval from. There's many silos in HSBC, you have credit cards, you have insurance and investments, you have home loans, and so, all of these guys, because if there's a branding exercise, they all have ways of tying in with women's golf. Even though it's supposed to be a branding exercise, they have equal say, because each one has a head on all of those departments. Then obviously from there you have a brand guardian from a client point of view who oversees all of that stuff, and then from the brand guard you have to go up to the next level, which is one of the top people in HSBC, and then because the project is so big, and it's going to have so much profile, and it's expensive, the CEO sees it as well. Not just that, after that, it has to go to global headquarters for approval as well. So global have their own point of view, local has their own point of view, and on top of that you have the, I'm not sure what they're called, but the golf association which handles all the female, professional golfers, and gave their feedback on what you're allowed to do and what you're not allowed to do in terms of visuals, how you can use the people's profile pictures, terminology in terms of golfing facts and things like that. So, there are multiple people involved. Then, right back at the agency point of view, you have CD and you have suits who all have an opinion as well. I think the brief was fairly straight forward, it wasn't a complicated brief. The complications came when you started to actually create the work and realize that there were a lot of things that you couldn't do, and you couldn't say. The brief itself was clear, but I guess if you were to make the brief really solid then you would put in all the restrictions as well, right at the very start. Not really budget, they were always gonna give this project a good budget. It was more a case of coming up with all the ideas first, looking at what was the best media placement for a lot of these ideas, and then working out what the budget would be for all the things that client and both agency liked. It was a bit of a pick and mix, it wasn't media defined what the requirements were, which is usually the case. A lot of the time media will say, “You need do a TV ad or a print ad, and the budget is this.” Whereas with this case it was more we just did a full activation campaign, which was everything, and then the client kind of looked at what things they liked and then wanted to know how much it would cost if we did bus, or we did TV and stuff like that, so budget wasn't really too much of a restriction. Time frames, original time frames were okay in terms of coming up with ideas and stuff like that. Execution and actually producing the work and getting it out on time was kind of a common problem, it was a bit rushed. I think we put forth about three concepts in terms of directions, then elaborated on one direction that we really liked, which then got watered down to what eventually came out. Relationships are good, this client is a good client, worked well with them. Honestly, they had little control as well from the local client. There were a lot of things that they couldn't really control as well. It was more a case of us trying to make the local client look good, make sure that they were happy, because a lot of things were out of their control. The team functioned fine, there was no real drama or issues in that respect. I think we were frustrated just with the amount of restrictions and changes that went on, there were a lot of changes. I mean, I say that from a creative and suits point of view, there was a lot of tension because it was a long project, because the amount of changes that came in. It wasn't just the change to a print concept, if there was a slight change, it affected everything, so you ended up having to change almost ten different mediums. It was time consuming and frustrating. ... but we like to give them grief when they're giving us a lot of stuff to do. It's more of a friendly banter as to, “You're giving us more changes?” and then as usual questioning how come we got changes again, but we still make the changes. I mean planning for our agency, there was not a lot of involvement between planning and creative. They tend to just do it on their own and then discuss with us, then that's that there. They're a little bit more elite in that way when it comes to the briefing. I mean, obviously we have a discussion about whether it's the right way to go. I wasn't involved in the planning stage though, so my involvement really took place when the brief came in. it was just pictures of the golfers, and a generic line on it that said, “Catch the best women golfers in action at HSBC Women's Champions.” For me, I think it was just a very average kind of idea, obviously expected. A lot of the reasons why I don't think it went well from a creative point of view was that there were way too many people involved in the project, there were too many restrictions from outside sources such as the talent management people hen, right back at the agency point of view, you have CD and you have suits who all have an opinion as well.   The complications came when you started to actually create the work and realize that there were a lot of things that you couldn't do, and you couldn't say. The brief itself was clear, but I guess if you were to make the brief really solid then you would put in all the restrictions as well, right at the very start. Honestly, they had little control as well from the local client. There were a lot of things that they couldn't really control as well. It was more a case of us trying to make the local client look good, make sure that they were happy, because a lot of things were out of their control.

    "text": "The statistics show that there are more female smokers and they are basically doing it because they see smoking as cool. It's a status thing back to the times when, you know, [inaudible 00:10:03] happened, and all of those things were cool. So what we did was - Well, because in the market there are lots of advertising about beauty and how women at this age stay actually very confident about the way they look and everything. So that's one of the main insights that actually came to the concept. So I mean, initially when it came out the idea people were thinking, like `Okay I don't know how this is going to work` because, I mean, first of all it's really disgusting. We didn't know exactly how open the client would be because they're so used to seeing the conventional ads like aging, you know, women aging and how you will die because you smoke and all that. To be honest, I mean I'm a smoker. Okay, right? But those things don't really have any impact on me. But the thing about this campaign is it's not to stop people from smoking, it's to prevent girls from smoking. So there's a slight difference. And we were quite surprised that they were actually very receptive to that because it's something that's completely brand new. Nobody has ever done that before and it actually did very well. There was lots of press around it and all that stuff so it was pretty good. So that is actually an example of almost - it's more of a guerrilla form so it's something that's not exactly very common. Not commonly used in the media, so this way of advertising. You don't put it in magazines and all that stuff. It's kind of like the trend now. Budget was pretty tight but the time was pretty okay. I think we - we did everything in about a month and a half maybe? Around there which is very good. Oh, simply to go against conventional media. Yeah, so we just needed something that is different from the usual magazine ads and press and all that stuff. So we figured that [inaudible 00:16:12] for a woman was like, 18-24 here. I mean, they're always out shopping. It is seen as important. Oh, simply to go against conventional media. Yeah, so we just needed something that is different from the usual magazine ads and press and all that stuff. So we figured that [inaudible 00:16:12] for a woman was like, 18-24 here. I mean, they're always out shopping. It is seen as important. So, we should catch them when they're doing something that they like most. When they're most unguarded basically. When they're walking down [inaudible 00:16:29] road and then, `Oh [inaudible 00:16:30]` It was very good. We actually managed to get them really excited about this project which was - yeah it was really good. Very accepted as well. In fact, we were the ones who came up with the whole formula of making the horrible perfume.   I guess when we first shared with them the idea they were probably - they were pretty excited but I think their may concern was like `It's so different from the brief` like `how are we going to sell this` so. One thing that we want you to do is don't worry. Leave it to us. To us it's like - most of the time you need to pre-sell the work. So we don't exactly have a lot of problems with assessing what we need. So what you'll do is to help us to work out of offices and everything once we decide which one the client's going with. So yeah, there's really not much of a problem with them. At that time we actually took a more guerilla approach. So what we actually did was - we actually had an event to launch a perfume and the perfume actually smells like a cigarette. So it's almost like the day after night at the party would be cigarette. So it's a whole big campaign launched, and it's down at [inaudible 00:10:56] Road as a big special show, and everyone's like [inaudible 00:10:59] and there are actually girls giving out perfume strips like test strips and it stinks. Yeah, so we just needed something that is different from the usual magazine ads and press and all that stuff. So we figured that [inaudible 00:16:12] for a woman was like, 18-24 here. I mean, they're always out shopping. It is seen as important. So, we should catch them when they're doing something that they like most. When they're most unguarded basically. When they're walking down [inaudible 00:16:29] road and then, `Oh [inaudible 00:16:30]` Yeah, we actually went out and tested with alcohol and we had to dig up ashtray cigarette butts and it was disgusting so yeah.",

    "text": "They wanted - what did they want? They wanted bus stop shelters for this year's campaign. I think they have a campaign every year. So this year's campaign they wanted to do bus stop shelters for - basically for branding. So what happened was we said `yes, let's do bus stop shelters. I mean, it is something you want. It doesn't really hurt anything. So let's just do that` I think the idea was pretty generic. The idea was like - you exercise and then you exercise three times a day, two times a week to keep your body healthy so you should just gargle your mouth like, once or twice a day for one week. Thirty seconds to keep your mouth healthy. It's the same logic as why you exercise, right? So they may be targeting people who are health conscience in a way. People who actually go to the gym, more active, all that stuff. I mean - I would think - as I walking - a very obvious media by would be in the gym. They had a pretty limited budget. I think it was - I can't remember how much was the money? So anyway they wanted to do things like bus stops and all that stuff. It's just a little bit too mass and it's too expensive. For price it's [inaudible 00:37:03] so it's not very cost effective. We were actually suggesting to them like `You know, because you are targeting at pretty specific people, so maybe you should - one very obvious place to advertise is at the gym.` Right? Maybe you can have simple things, cheap things like mirror stickers for example. Right? To tell people to make sure you gargle your mouth every - twice a day. And you can have - in gym's for example a lot of them with a view. There's quite a few where it's along the road. For normal pedestrians, they see people working out at the gym. So maybe you should just borrow out the whole thing off them exercising. Off you exercising in live zones like a live action thing of them exercising and then have your message there. Right? So gargle twice to keep your mouth happy. I mean, we as a team - we were trying to basically get them too spend their limited budget on effective media and not on the conventional media. I think at this time, conventional media - it still works for branding purposes but it's really not very cost effective. So it doesn't really make any sense at all for them to spend so much money on these things and then it's so miss. Right? But somehow, they were just not very receptive to new native eyes. They just feel `If I don't have an ad in the newspaper, nobody will know what Listerine is`. And in this day and age, that's not the way it is. Even for online where this idea of, you know, you have a Facebook application or something and then you have this little tool which is like a Listerine, so it's like a Listerine bottle, right? So what happens is it's a tool, it's an application for you to clean up your teeth for your pictures. So if you upload pictures from Flickr or whatever. That's going to upload pictures on Facebook or Flickr or whatever. You can actually go to this application. And then somehow, I don't know how it works but you just program it to whiten your teeth. So it's basically an application for your brand and industry. So it's simple things like that. They use on the chance that Facebook is hot. People use Flickr. It's not expensive to produce. It's pretty long term no matter what your message is, it's really long term. You can actually use it for a couple years. It's extremely well to your brand. Your product. They were like `No. It's not really well.` They always want to follow the norm. What other people are doing. Which, obviously is not effective. Anymore. I guess it's pretty much the same. I mean we were all pretty excited initially but I think with this particular client, they are really not receptive to good ideas so - there are a lot of times when - especially the suits who are presenting - they tend to be on the safe side as well. I would say that - I guess for them. After working for them, for the clients for awhile, they become a little bit boring themselves. They become very safe and they become very uninspiring actually because most of the time they are like `Oh no. I think they work like this.` They were pretty alright other than the fact that they are - they try to be safe simply because of the size of the client. That was a bit frustrating but other than that I think that accounts is actually - they usually try to support our ideas.  mean, we as a team - we were trying to basically get them too spend their limited budget on effective media and not on the conventional media But somehow, they were just not very receptive to new native eyes. They just feel `If I don't have an ad in the newspaper, nobody will know what Listerine is`. And in this day and age, that's not the way it is. I guess it's pretty much the same.

    "text": "Yeah, I'm just thinking back to January when I was doing this massive pitch. And it was everyone in the agency was involved, in the sense of all the big poobahs, from the head of the Asia-Pacific office down to my own creative director and all the suits. It was like a [inaudible 00:21:04] of some 15 people, which was both very good and very, very bad because everyone had inputs and when the senior guys have inputs right or wrong, you have to listen to them. And often, because of the sheer number of senior people involved, there was a lot of, well, intellectual masturbation and a lot of egos at stake also. But again, there were that many perspectives and I think that sort of, we had days with great highs and great lows because we could come up with an entirely new direction every day. And it was frustrating because, as creators, you're going down one road in terms of one direction. You flesh out the direction for four days and then you find that, come day five, that has been canned because something, there's a new angle, there's a new direction. So, what happened this particular campaign, I'm not getting into the agency or the names, obviously. But, I think we were able to discuss the issues really threadbare. We were able to look at all the possible angles. And it was a do-or-die situation with the agency because they had messed up a couple of important projects for the same client before, so the client had made it very clear that this is your make-or-break effort. If you do not pull through on this one, the whole business goes. Not in so many words, but it was kind of implied. So, we had to go through the cycle of changes, of direction every two days. Finally, then things came to a head. The creative director sort of cut out everything else and said, “Okay, this is the direction we're going.” And I think everything fell into place after that once all the other stuff had been eliminated, in terms of the wrong directions. And he goes, “I've been [inaudible 00:23:00],” and we had settled on one direction which made the most sense. Then it was a matter of fleshing out that direction. We sat with the whole team, creative team sat together and fleshed out all the different ideas from above the line, print, to below the line, brochures, banners, hoardings, billboards, what have you, and through the line, online, from websites to microsites to banners and viral videos and everything else.  We sat with the whole team, creative team sat together and fleshed out all the different ideas from above the line, print, to below the line, brochures, banners, hoardings, billboards, what have you, and through the line, online, from websites to microsites to banners and viral videos and everything else. What you could see was A, the quality of the thinking, it was a very sound, very strategic, very solid, and it was equally well-expressed in terms of creativity, in terms of the idea being fleshed out, because there's one idea expressed in seven different ways to give it dimensions. So, everything led to the same thing, but it was completely there, the plan was completely bulldozed. We had done some 70-odd boards, on which we had shown everything. The whole conference room was completely covered by those boards and it was an awesome presentation. And the client applauded at the end of it. Needless to say, the agency not only won that piece of business, but suddenly it's getting a whole lot of business. It was a great team effort and it was both frustrating as well as stimulating. Well, in this case, since it was a make-or-break effort for the agency, they were willing to try whatever it took, as long as it met the client's needs. The agency from what I can see is not terribly out there. It would like to be, but it doesn't exactly have a reputation for strong creativity and all that. And to be fair, this particular client, it's not exactly known for their own creativity. They are very conservative, very- Yes. They researched ... Excuse me, I can't because it's still, that particular campaign is still being developed so obviously I cannot say more about it. They like the core direction, but they are concerned about one element of it, in terms of how ... Again it sounds very, horribly vague but without getting into confidential stuff, I won't be able to expound on that. Well, the brief was not much to begin with. It kind of evolved, and ... lots of holes were picked in it and rightly so, and then it evolved and it became tighter and tighter, much more solid. It was nothing to begin with, really. It was only when it survived countless rounds of intervention by senior creators and planners and agency devs that something began to come out of it. Because otherwise it was a pretty wishy-washy brief. Time, well to begin with, there was, I guess, three weeks which is a lifetime in advertising. We usually get two to four days, sometimes a day. But because of all the intellectual masturbation that came around, it took about two weeks for that to come to a close, and finally we got about five days to turn it around in terms of actual creativity and fleshing out the campaign and all that. I think, settling on one strong direction rather than different people coming in on different days and throwing out different ideas or throwing indifferent ideas. Because it was all over the place for the first two weeks. It was only the third and last week that everything fell together because people realized that we did not have enough time to dick around anymore. We needed to settle on a direction and go forward with that. I think, once that direction was agreed upon and there were going to be no changes to that direction, then I think the ideas flowed. Because otherwise we struggled with some stuff which looked interesting but didn't go anywhere or got changed midstream. That can be, obviously, very frustrating. Well at that point, it was all on a very good plain because the client was pretty unhappy and was on the verge of giving away a chunk of the business to some other agency. I think it was civil but cold. And I don't blame the client because obviously, the messes that happened were the agency's fault. It was not surprising that the client had lost faith in the agency. Pretty good. Except for, again, some egos and some feathers being ruffled initially. But I think because everyone's jobs on the line on that particular project, everyone sort of fell into line. All the [inaudible 00:31:57] differences were finally ironed out. Because some of those [inaudible 00:32:03] differences did create headaches for us as a creative team because, like I said, we were going down one direction, then four days later find that it changed completely. But I think overall, it was one of the best campaigns that I have done.   Those were good also. It was just that a lot of the key people were not seeing eye to eye sometimes. And what is really frustrating is when people who attended one meeting, the previous meeting, do not attend the following meeting and people who've not attended, say, meeting number three then come into, oh, people who attended meeting three don't come into meeting four and five and six. And people who've not attended meeting four, five and six happen coming back in the seventh meeting and then they have their own inputs, you know? It was so ... everyone and all the decision-makers need to be in all the meetings all the time. Otherwise, if you've missed out on something that happened two meetings ago, or even one meeting ago, you can't come back and say, “Hang on, but what about this direction?”",

    "text": "Well, I can think of one, again, in recent memory and without getting into the agency. There just wasn't enough time given to us on that project. We were given just three days to do a major campaign. And the brief was not bad, it was reasonably good, as good as could be under the circumstances. But creative was not given enough time to flesh out the whole thing, and given the importance of that project as a pitch, they should have had more than one team on it. There was just one team and I was 50% of that team. We came up with something good enough, but I think we could have done more and better and perhaps and more ... No we did actually two different directions, but it would have been nicer to have had more than one team working on it, so that there could be more ideas and better ideas. And again, there was not enough brainstorming that happened on that. So it was on the other end of this other project that I talked about, that there were 15 people involved, 16 people involved, and here there were only three people involved. Obviously, and the time was not good enough in terms of three, four days to turn it around. So it was just me and the art director and the creative director and just three of us. And the creative director had his own things to do, so he was not there all the time, he was vetting and approving the broad ideas. So basically, just me and the art director we felt both pressured as well as not enough brainstorming and ideas, not enough people to bounce ideas off of. Well ... No because the agency didn't win the account, so it went to somebody else. Time was tight. Budget, there was really no budget to this because it depended on the idea, they would find the money for it. It was not lavish, it was enough to work with. And like I said, really there was no defined figure because it was a pitch in the campaign. It all depended on the idea. Well, there was not much time or room for inspiration because we just had to get on with our job. So I think it was just myself and the art director and the creative director sitting together and brainstorming. Of course, we did have a couple of meetings with the suits on as well, the downstairs people. But I think the brief would have been the single last source of inspiration in this case. And of course [inaudible 00:40:51] what was happening elsewhere in the market for property and everything else. Yeah. Basically there was no time to sit and get inspiration. In this case, honestly, I wouldn't know because I was not ... I think the client was a first-timer, we had not done anything for them before. Although they knew the agency, but I don't think the agency had done anything for them really, not at that point in time. But again, I did not have any direct meetings with the client. Because again, this was a freelance project I'd done. Normally, freelancers don't go and do presentations. Naturally, they are not fronted with a client because they are here today, may not be tomorrow. Yeah. And also ... I think one of the key things that we were told at the beginning of this project was ... It was implied, I guess, that there was not much confidence within the agency about that project, and the fact that we can't reverse. I think it was done because it needed to be done, for whatever political reasons that can appear [inaudible 00:42:25]. When I think back on it, it could have influenced us somewhat, knowing that our heart is not really into this piece of business, the agency saying that implicitly, not explicitly. And we are doing this presentation because we need to make a presentation.   No, I mean the relationships were good, the interaction was good. It's just that there was not much time to elicit or interact and develop it together as a team. There was a planner involved, and she had contributions to make. But again, we were all fighting for time.",

    "text": "There was a funny episode a long time back. There was this commercial case we were doing. It was, they have too many restrictions. The thought was we had this family going to the KFC and the order, and then the kid looks up and he sees the mall Santa sitting outside eating by himself. So the kid feels sad and tugs at his dad's shirt. And the next shot was Santa saying it's time for sharing. And the client said, `Santa doesn't eat.` `Santa doesn't eat.` So how do you argue that? How can we say back, you know? I say you're talking about disappointing stuff. Like this commercial for KFC, right? We had this, it was for Christmas season thing. We had this, it had a lot of restrictions. You had to have 15 seconds of the ad and two seconds on the chicken or whatever it is. In that first half you gotta tell the story if there is a story at all. So we had this, thought we'd make it a bit cute. We had this family going into this KFC restaurant. Then as they're ordering the kid looks up and there's a mall Santa sitting outside eating by himself. Most of the cases have a mall here. And the kid tugs at his dad's shirt. The next shot is you have Santa sharing the meal with him. It's about Christmas and spreading the cheer, sharing. So when we would explain that to the client, she said, `But Santa doesn't eat.` So they didn't buy the commercial because they thought Santa didn't eat. Which was a bit, very odd. It's the, it's like you have a bunch of people, let's say six guys. There's one person that's gonna say yes or now. And once the person says something everybody will say yeah yeah yeah, he's a charming guy, he's like Gandhi. Or whatever they say, they're just reflect. They won't change their mind or disagree with him. It's always quick turnaround, two days. Yeah, with KFC it was always insanely tight. I don't know. They seemed ... I think because of somebody turning up late, she was a bit pissed off. Maybe not very cordial at that. I said they're stupid. A bit dense, yeah. No I guess the client was a bit difficult too because of the nature of the function of the business leg. Retail has to be very quick. Very conservative, I would say.   So I guess it's a mixture of everything. The planning, a bit too much on the defensive side. So it's been about pain, and the tactic line all coming together.",

So team leader leave and new people comes, the people may be more ... have more experience, knowledge about the difference of culture. This is one thing. These other things is some people can not leave. Have to face the truth, have to adjust to it, themselves to fit it. To face the real life. And these kind of things, I think the important things is for this kind of the fighting is there should be a coordinator in the top of the different team. He can ... how to say? He can little bit forecast all this trouble, coming trouble in [inaudible 00:16:33]. Or, he can ... he have enough power to influence all the team member to try convince the team, convince the team and try to make some ... to be a combination finally. So this coordinator is very important for this. Actually, 200. This project my company hired for one global coordinator. So the global coordinator is located in ... fortunately, located in China. But he has a very long working experience in group, so he has enough power to influence the top and he has enough strong pipeline with clients because they worked together long ago. He is the key person, and he is the main decision maker. Yeah, it's high. Have to say it's high. I don't know it's ... if this is normal in US company. Normally, in Asian company, clients always ask for evidence. In other words, they ask for evidence. For example, if you want to apply offer some solution, they always go ask for, `Do you have really experience for this solution before?` So it means they want ... they prefer, the clients prefer more existing solution rather than innovation one. But this is only in mechanical manufacturer's side. This is from client's side. And also for supplier's side, we also try to use some new but ... some new but existing solution rather than brand new idea because this is a low risk and easy to handle. Yeah. Actually, this is a very important issue for ... especially for technical project, because we needed to figure out client, the needs for our clients. So make sure what we are doing is fit for this, and only focus on this rather than anything else. Yeah. Sometimes, it's ... of course, because it's document, we need ... Normally, we need a kickoff meeting to discussion this brief or this description before. And after discussion, we make it officially. Make each other understand each other very clearly. Then, we make it officially then issue it to all our people in this project. It's very important. I have to say it's very important. Sometimes, 'cause ... how to say? I would like to talk this engineering point of view, because engineers is the people who are handling this daily life, the real world, so they face the same ... they have the same target. The target is to finish the job, perfect it in time. So in this kind of situation, clients, engineer and client, engineer and supplier, or engineering suppliers [inaudible 00:29:50] it's just like a big team. Of course, they ... every people want to cover some [inaudible 00:29:54] but they work together. So this is the one thing, one biggest things. And other things, all this relationship is built up in the basis of the trust. In the trust. How to establish this trust in very short time? It's very important. This depends on the personal skill. How to handle communication, how to ... handling the relationship with clients. Also including culture issue. So you need to pay attention to some cultural forbidden area. You need to know what's the things make Japanese happy, what topic German people would like to talk, or what ... don't like to talk. Something like this. So you need to pay attention to some cultural forbidden area. You need to know what's the things make Japanese happy, what topic German people would like to talk, or what ... don't like to talk. Something like this. So this is culture things. Another thing is try to be open, and also try to help clients in any kind of the aspects. For example if clients felt you, your company [inaudible 00:31:41] it. So you're the project leader, but it's better, especially in Asia, it's better for you to show him around the factory and the shop, including the ... Also, you should arrange the apartment or arrange a hotel personally for him and accompany him to some exciting site, even during the holiday. For this project, I'm alone in Japan and I ... as a guest engineer inside of the client. So I have no team around me together, and what I can do is I try to make friends in customer's office, including office lady, including the cleaner, of course the section manager and especially the purchasing people. How to do this is, one thing is ... So you need to catch every chance to talk with them to find out what's their background, what things they are passionate to, or what kind of the ... even the ... including some family issues. Yeah. Actually happened. So we invited, including the manager, including the purchasing people, including [inaudible 00:34:44] invited to the company, our company in Germany and our company in China, and we pay almost all the expense for them and by the name of the ... some kind of the business. For example, this is very often in engineering work. So, the design also be modified, modify that again and again. Sometimes, it's because of the request. Sometimes it's because of the not so good work for. So anyway, the design change, design modification happened any single day. So this makes things ... make life very difficult, because it's very interesting for you to test it out one more [inaudible 00:36:29], but it's very boring for you to design it again and again. Maybe five or six times in one week or in one month. Yeah. It's because I have a team [inaudible 00:37:30] in Germany, they did four parts for me so in the ... and the time difference between Germany and Japan is eight or seven hours, I don't know exactly. So this means clients and I worked it in Japan, so reviewed all the design, then I sent it back. So it's in time of the ... maybe seven o'clock, evening. So this is the time Germany just start work, so they start work. They get to the field, again, I make a conference call with them and then after one day when I wake up, the results comes to my computer and I translate it and talk it with supplier again ... with clients again. So this is one cycle, and this cycle is around again everyday. So this is quite hard, because Japanese people, they too work very team work for [inaudible 00:38:32] so any people, even the operator in assembly line can submit the review opinion to what they like. For example, the one senior operator, [inaudible 00:38:47], he said, `Oh, this operation ask for too much force. I can not afford. I have no force to put it by my finger. You need to reduce the force.` Like this. So we have to ask ... also we have to improve our deal again and again. I have to say, sometimes the customer does not organize all kind of these request very well. So this means they did not do some organizations and make all these requests come to a combination and give it to supplier together in the same time. It's just one question from this side, another request from other side. And finally come to me. I need to do some this kind of things before I send it direct to my team. So this is ... Yeah. This is one thing we often to negotiate it with clients, because we want to ask for more time, more budget. We can't always try to avoid something [inaudible 00:25:31] So collect all this information, so it's a bit like spying. Collect all this information, and try to treat them well. For example, invite them to a restaurant, also include the family member and arrange some business trip, but a very relaxed business trip. Invite them from Japan to China, or from Japan to Germany so anyway you can use the company resource to treat clients very well, especially in Asia this is very important. ... So for me, the challenges is two things. Actually, it's three things. The one thing is the culture. Second thing is the technical content. The third one is schedule, how we schedule. And the second thing is the technical issue. Technical issue is also a big issue, because Japanese people have their own standard, and also Germany people have their own standard, very proud, be proud of that. So Chinese people, I work the between these two, and I'm face this ... face me with [inaudible 00:13:39]. So this makes life difficult, so how to do this? It's a very sensitive issues. Yeah, finally it's ... anyway, because a lot of the compromise. So anyway, every people have to feel happy. So clients take one step back and the supplier side also take some step ... a step back so we can finally come to a combination and make the team work very well, very smoothly So as a project leader, you should protect your team. So how to protect them? You need to negotiate with the client. It means as the project leader you did not ... The bad things is you just transfer, exactly transfer what customer request to your team and ask your team to do it. This is not good. You need to negotiate with customer first. You need to sort some things, you need to cut some or [inaudible 00:37:08] in your side. So you said all this is [inaudible 00:37:12]. Information is not complete. Maybe we can wait for some couple of days. So this kind of the things quite help team. Something like this, it's helpful to build up the relationship. And the one important thing is never let your customer feel ... face the difficult situation because of your mistake or because of you did not explain to him clearly. So for example, you make some mistake. You want to cover it, you don't want to open it, share it with your client. But finally, things will come. So these kind of things need to be avoid. So try to build up a open trust relationship is very important. One team leader from Germany side, he said, `I have to go back to spend the Christmas with my family.` But during that time, it's very critical situation for this project so we can not actually ... the team cannot afford to lose him, but he did had to go. And so Japanese clients is very angry about this, and so they say a lot of the bad things to him. Something like this, `I think he is not qualified for this work.` But actually, this is not about the personal qualifications. It's about culture. So this is one thing. So this is big difference. So Germany people can not understand this, so in the beginning they're a lot of the trouble because Japanese people think, `Ah. It's so rude. You fight with clients in the meeting. It's unbelievable.` So something like this.   As the project leader, you need to take care of those clients on your team. So team is very important for you, because the team is the people who work for you. Who make the drawing, who finish the testing [crosstalk 00:35:34] and also you ... the important things, you should treat your team as well. So because teammate is a person. So after they have to work their father, brother, sister, or son, daughter, it's a family. So there are a lot of the personal things they want to care, take care. So you needed to. Don't make them so hard. This means you should protect your team. So it means they want ... they prefer, the clients prefer more existing solution rather than innovation one. But this is only in mechanical manufacturer's side. This is from client's side. And also for supplier's side, we also try to use some new but ... some new but existing solution rather than brand new idea because this is a low risk and easy to handle. Yeah. It's because I have a team [inaudible 00:37:30] in Germany, they did four parts for me so in the ... and the time difference between Germany and Japan is eight or seven hours, I don't know exactly. So this means clients and I worked it in Japan, so reviewed all the design, then I sent it back. So it's in time of the ... maybe seven o'clock, evening. So this is the time Germany just start work, so they start work. They get to the field, again, I make a conference call with them and then after one day when I wake up, the results comes to my computer and I translate it and talk it with supplier again ... with clients again. So this is one cycle, and this cycle is around again everyday. PROJECT ID And the personal relationship helps a lot. For example, if this project just start and you are very new, you don't know how to get help from clients or from other ... sort some other kind of things. So if you have the personal relationship with clients or with other peoples, so a lot of the resource will come to you very easily. Sometimes just one word, or just some ... one piece of paper, one link, will help you a lot in the beginning. And the personal relationship helps a lot. For example, if this project just start and you are very new, you don't know how to get help from clients or from other ... sort some other kind of things. So if you have the personal relationship with clients or with other peoples, so a lot of the resource will come to you very easily. Sometimes just one word, or just some ... one piece of paper, one link, will help you a lot in the beginning. PROJECT ID Make each other understand each other very clearly. Then, we make it officially then issue it to all our people in this project. So the one thing to ... this is also regarding the culture. A lot of the meeting, so in the whole project, a lot of the meeting happened. Maybe every day, maybe every time ... one time every week. So for Germany people, the meeting is the place to express, to fight. But for Chinese people and Japanese people, the ... especially for the official meeting, the official meeting is the only place to announce some decision. So it means before the meeting, a lot of the work should be done. We can not waiting until the meeting, hope meeting can give us the solution. So the culture is my biggest thing. For example, I think almost all of the Asia people, Japanese people and Chinese people very devoted to their work. That means they overtime work, very long time, overtime work and no any [inaudible 00:12:18], actually I have [inaudible 00:12:19] 'cause I have to do this. But Germany people, it's different things. They much more pertinent to their personal life, but so the one biggest fight among this team is actually just before Christmas. So culture is a very big issue at that time, because you know Chinese people and Japanese people have some of these kind of things because of the history reason, and also Germany people, the culture of Germany people is also very different. So Japanese culture, Chinese culture, and the Germany culture. I work there in Japan with my Japanese customer, but I have to deliver all the information necessary to my Germany colleague. Have them do the [inaudible 00:11:51] job for me, and we regulate in Japan. So I go back to them, give them the feedback again. So this kind of the cycle.",

    "text": "Yeah, this is also this ... for my previous company. And also for the same story. So we want to develop some parts for Japanese customer, but is ... we have no Germany side involved, only Chinese team and the Japanese customer in Shanghai. The project is like this. It's a very simple project for cars. Our company is for car. So Japanese customer comes to our facility. And this guy, he worked for Honda, for Honda before, and he left Honda, joined tier one of Honda in Japan, and he comes China. He's very young, but in his team, he's the senior, the most senior people. He come to us, and he gave us the design he make. And the things is, he only do the design by his point of view. It's just for ... to have all of the requests from his side. But the things we ... I am the supplier, I have to make tooling to make this part. So the tooling actually have a lot of the issue. Sometimes, it's one structure. It's very easy to be finished in it's really [inaudible 00:43:41] remodeling but it's difficult to build. So for these other things, he ... how to say? A lot of the trouble in these kind of things, and we try to support him to keep his original thinking because this is very important for Asian people. So if you say that I want to, oh, you are my clients so I needed to keep your [inaudible 00:44:06] so if I say, `Oh, I don't agree with your design because it does not work.` I mean, a feasibility issue, and this not very good. You should express this in a very ... this way. Yeah. And we try first to keep his original design, and he very happy about this, but finally we think this is not good. We treat him in wrong way. We should have told him directly or told him much more stronger. So finally, his design is being modified a lot after tooling launched. So this cost us some extra money, make him not happy. So that's [inaudible 00:44:51] Yeah. This is interesting. Budget is always tight, but the schedule you can see is endless, can be extended. It means customer requested very strongly and strictly in the beginning. But anyway, there comes to some compromise so we modified the schedule again and again. So partly of the reason is from ... because these parts is finally to GM Shanghai. So GM Shanghai changes schedule, so we have [inaudible 00:50:24] this. And the other issues is from some our own sake only reason we have to adjust the schedule. So it seems very strictly and very tightly in the beginning. And actually, after we finish the project, we take a review. It's two times longer than planned, the plan. Yes, actually this is two things. One things that were ... the customer's engineer, they have their own experience and they saw a lot of the solution before. So we are a little bit specialist in just one narrow field. So from this [inaudible 00:51:21] our customer gave us some suggestion for design. This is one thing, and that thing is we get some good idea from our tooling supplier, because they make tooling and they finally is ... they fixed this real life. So they figure out some issues and they estimate some risk, in other words. So one side is from clients, also from our supplier we get the new idea or get the inspiration. Actually, it's quite well. It's quite pretty well in the beginning, and also after the project ends because he know we help him a lot. The things is ... the normal thing is that we treat him well as well, and the [inaudible 00:55:01] things is we try to save money for him and we make him know we make a lot of effort to do this, and make that very clear to him. So this is from two things. One thing is from the new design from our suggestion. We suggest it for you change a little bit in your design, this way it will save how much money. So this is one thing. Another things is the mistakes that already happened, tooling already make. We have to make it ... repair it. Or [inaudible 00:55:38] client. So we just send a description of this ... how this work cost, and we don't [inaudible 00:55:46] for long term relationship. So this make him very grateful for us, because actually, if his boss know this, will make him better performance something like this. So these things, these kind of efforts make the relationship very good. And finally, after one year when we pay our visits on their headquarter in Japan to do something and they call seminar. And this guy also take part in the seminar. And just after this meeting, he bring his section manager and his technical director to us. He said he want to involve us into some new project because of the excellent job we have done before with him to get. So you can see from if you try to keep a long term distance and you can use your company resource to save clients money and maybe sometimes to cover the mistake they made. This is very helpful, because they know they can trust you, they can depend on you. This is quite smooth because we are in the same culture. All the team is a local team in Shanghai, and team member is young so have no any family lot, so he can work overnight or even work on Sunday or Monday. What I can do for him is I keep him refuse the repeating work. I try to reduce the workload for him, and also try to create some chance for him to visit the supplier, to go into ... to go to take the technical training and maybe a business trip to Japan, these kind of things. Everything make him feel happy and feel ... be respected. Problem is like this. The main reason, I have to say, is the engineer from client's side is not so experienced. This is very normal in Japan, because Japan ... Japanese want to separate work in very detailed. Detailed [inaudible 00:42:31]. If you do this job, you just do this job in your whole life maybe. So they did not have chance to make ... to design a wider range of products, so their knowledge is very deep but very limited. So it is a problem. Actually, it's our client. So in this field, in the subcontract, or tier two, for automotive industry, not so much tolerance from client's side for innovation things. They also ask for safety. Make sure existing solution. Yeah. This is useful for two things. One thing is useful for quotation, and the second thing, is useful for us to prepare in advance. For example, we needed to buy the material they requested, and from their supplier. And also, we used this spreadsheet to figure out how much the workload will be, and we tried to keep the resource of [inaudible 00:53:30] for the design work. And also, we needed to negotiate with our tooling supplier in advance, because some schedule issue. Because our supplier is very busy, so we needed to talk with them. Oh, in the next two months we need to launch this tooling. Please keep [inaudible 00:53:48] for us. Something like this. He said he want to involve us into some new project because of the excellent job we have done before with him to get. So you can see from if you try to keep a long term distance and you can use your company resource to save clients money and maybe sometimes to cover the mistake they made. This is very helpful, because they know they can trust you, they can depend on you. if his boss know this, will make him better performance something like this. So these things, these kind of efforts make the relationship very good. PROJECT ID  you are my clients so I needed to keep your [inaudible 00:44:06] so if I say, `Oh, I don't agree with your design because it does not work.` I mean, a feasibility issue, and this not very good. You should express this in a very ... this way.   eah. And we try first to keep his original design, and he very happy about this, but finally we think this is not good. We treat him in wrong way. We should have told him directly or told him much more stronger. So finally, his design is being modified a lot after tooling launched. So this cost us some extra money, make him not happy. So that's [inaudible 00:44:51]",

    "text": "I think it was the four of us on the core team. I think Ian, who was the project manager, was really good at insulating the team from any day-to-day or short term or tactical considerations that might come up with the client. So he fielded all that kind of stuff to let the team keep thinking about big picture. And any decisions that came up in that arena, he handled without bothering us. But any questions that were about how are we thinking about this design problem, and how are we gonna give this client the best solution? That was a very democratic and respectful core team, which was nice, and just about everything was done by consensus, and it was never really divisive. I can't think of any particular incidents, but if there were disagreements within the team, Ian was strong enough leader to either moderate them to come to a mutually agreeable decision or just pull rank and say, `Look, I respect what you guys are saying, but as project leader, we need to make a direction, and it's gonna be this. So sorry if you don't like it. That's what it's gonna be.` It was high. I think it was high because they understood the spectrum of innovation, like we can take this current product and put a new skin on it, and make it look fresh and be over at this end. Or we could throw it all out the window, and do something completely new and be at this end. And they understood the risk reward of moving along that spectrum, and they helped us focus our thinking on what was appropriate. So that's not necessarily an easy thing to do, and so we were ... Those were basically the criteria, I think, that we were given. And within that, we were given pretty much free reign to explore wherever we saw fit. And think what was cool about that project was first we had just a killer team with Jerry O'Leary, who was one of our greatest, I think, industrial designers, in the company, Ian Roberts, who is one of practice leads, who's got a really strong design and engineering background. Another great designer, [Kwan 00:15:57] Chang, who is no longer with the company, and myself. I think we were sort of the core team. But I guess the really cool thing about that was the client took a very holistic approach. They were like, `Let's start with figuring out what our brand is gonna stand for, and then let's think about what are the opportunities to really express our values through design. And then let's take our time with the design and make sure we're coming up with something that's compelling, and doing solid engineering work to back that up.`  But I guess the really cool thing about that was the client took a very holistic approach. They were like, `Let's start with figuring out what our brand is gonna stand for, and then let's think about what are the opportunities to really express our values through design. And then let's take our time with the design and make sure we're coming up with something that's compelling, and doing solid engineering work to back that up.` So we laid out this really nice work plan that encompassed all those things, and we had a great core team that stayed engaged all the way from beginning to end. So I was an engineer. I wasn't leading a whole lot of the activities early on, but I was exposed to it. Also, I understood the philosophy of the project and what the client was looking for, and I was part of the whole concept generation, which I think led to stronger concepts and got me to buy into the whole direction of the project before I eventually became responsible for it. We had to get the products out the door. And then for the engineering, they asked us to design not just the aesthetics but all the interactions. And then for the engineering, they asked us to design not just the aesthetics but all the interactions. And we came up with these very animated products with lots of motion and lots of mechanism, lots of surprising behaviors that were engineering challenges, which was really kind of neat because those kinds of things had to be developed in parallel with the industrial design and the look of the products. So these guys would be coming up with concepts of what this thing should like. Together, we were coming up with the concepts for how it should behave and how things should move, and then the engineers, led by me, were responsible for coming up with figuring out how to make these behaviors happen inside this envelope that these designers were busy defining. So it was a lot of parallel effort, a lot of give and take, a lot of me as an engineer explaining to you as a designer why we can't do what you're suggesting, but we could this. And the designer's explaining to me as an engineer why that didn't fit with his design philosophy and offering other ideas about how we might be able to accomplish something similar. And maybe that's where this feeling of professional respect comes in because there's a lot of give and take and needing to be able to explain to the team what your constraints as a discipline really were in making the vision come to life. But then as a team, compiling all those things and figuring out, for the good of the project and for the strategic objectives, how are we gonna push through this in sort of a multidisciplinary way? But it was also great because it made for a very engaged management team on the client side, right? They were obviously very motivated to make this successful, and that got the CEO to the presentations. It got him invested in making sure he was making longterm, value adding decisions. And so he stayed involved, he was there, and he gave us great feedback and gave us well-informed decisions at appropriate times to allow us to keep going forward. And then there was this other guy, who was our day-to-day contact. And he was not a real effective leader, but he was the kind of guy to ... Did he really make important decisions? Not really, his role was answering any minor questions that came up along the way to make sure we could keep moving on track, which is valuable from a tactical, logistical point of view. But it was also great because it made for a very engaged management team on the client side, right? They were obviously very motivated to make this successful, and that got the CEO to the presentations. It got him invested in making sure he was making longterm, value adding decisions. And so he stayed involved, he was there, and he gave us great feedback and gave us well-informed decisions at appropriate times to allow us to keep going forward. But I would say it was really the CEO who gave the strategic insight. And the designer's explaining to me as an engineer why that didn't fit with his design philosophy and offering other ideas about how we might be able to accomplish something similar. And maybe that's where this feeling of professional respect comes in because there's a lot of give and take and needing to be able to explain to the team what your constraints as a discipline really were in making the vision come to life. But then as a team, compiling all those things and figuring out, for the good of the project and for the strategic objectives, how are we gonna push through this in sort of a multidisciplinary way?

And then let's take our time with the design and make sure we're coming up with something that's compelling, and doing solid engineering work to back that up.` So just the way the project was designed was really nice and just the way the team interacted. There was a lot of mutual respect in terms of what different people were bringing to the team. In terms of stress, it felt well-balanced. It felt mutually respectful, and I think it was neat because there were challenges for all of us. The designers were challenged to come up with something new and iconic and really strategic in terms of design. It wasn't just make it look pretty. It was make it exciting, make it say something about our brand, and make it cutting edge, which was a challenge that they can really get excited about.   And so he stayed involved, he was there, and he gave us great feedback and gave us well-informed decisions at appropriate times to allow us to keep going forward. And then there was this other guy, who was our day-to-day contact. And he was not a real effective leader, but he was the kind of guy to ... Did he really make important decisions?

    "text": "I think the one thing where corner may have been cut were on the actual engineering execution of the design. Because we basically came up with the architecture for how this device would go together in a way that made sense and allowed us to realize the design we were hoping to get. Obviously very iconic itself, the round click wheel on the iPod sort of is reflected in the end caps of the speaker design, so that was an element of it that I think appealed to a lot of people in terms of creating a relationship between our product and the one that it had to work with, just visually. But I think it was combination of the round cylinder being such a simple extruded form, and yet being sort of antithetical to what people think of when they think of speakers, which is rectangular boxes. And I think it's that tension, or those two seemingly incompatible ideas working so nicely together, is what made that idea sort of exciting for all of us. And we respected the feedback that they gave to us and their priorities. That might have been the love part. The hate part was our day-to-day guy being a little bit too micro-managing, being a little bit too constantly flustered. Like if we ever called him, I'd be like, `Well you know, we're not quite ready for this review tomorrow, can we have it the next day?` And he would just be like ... You know the kind of guy, he's wedded to his GANT chart, he freaks out if something's not going exactly according to his plan. Whereas we at IDEO are thinking three steps ahead and saying, ` It takes us an extra day now to get a better result three weeks from now. Doesn't that make sense to do it that way?` But this guy was much more of a by-the-books, Type A stress case. And so having him as a day-to-day ... You know, maybe it's a good thing, that he gets us thinking about some of the stuff that we don't always think of as the highest of priorities. But on the whole I would say he probably added more stress and discomfort and unproductive anxiety to the team, I would say that would outweigh any potential positive contributions he made. And he would just be like ... You know the kind of guy, he's wedded to his GANT chart, he freaks out if something's not going exactly according to his plan. Whereas we at IDO are thinking three steps ahead and saying, ` It takes us an extra day now to get a better result three weeks from now. Doesn't that make sense to do it that way?` Something about being very explicit about that and having a client that really believed in the importance of this project must have greased the skids for us to negotiate a nice long schedule to make sure we could iterate and refine and review and incorporate all of their feedback. And test, and iterate again. And I think that's what led us to such a nice end result.   One other comment on that guy was that it was really valuable that we were cultivating this relationship with the CEO as well. Because ... And Ian was really good at this. If there was a problem in the inter-company dynamics, Ian is very diplomatic and yet effective at bringing that to the attention of people on their side who could help iron things out. Tell them call off the attack dog, or whatever. And I think that was probably a significant help, or reason for our success. Which is more and more commonly the case. And the end result on this project is sort of typical of what we see, which is that that part gets rushed, it's done by the client internally, by engineer who are not as invested in the design and what we're trying to accomplish with it. They take some shortcuts or they squeeze some cost out of it and it ends up not being quite as nice as we like to think it would've been had we done it ourselves. Of course we'll never know. Generally speaking ... A little bit of a love/hate ... the CEO and the people who only we engaged with at these very important milestones, very positive relationship. They didn't always love what we did, but they respected us as consultants, they didn't wanna second-guess every decision we made, they sort of empowered us to make the decisions we felt right most of the time, and they trusted us to do that as their advisors.",

    "text": "So for this project we're gonna go out and we're gonna think less about premium and think more about mass market and low end and put all that together and come up with a strategy for them to come up with a product line that will cover all the statements they want to address. Yeah, it's a Chinese client. And I'm still not sure we've completely recovered from that. Because, it's really weird how one comment can be made and it just has this ripple effect through a whole project. Like, `Really, we're gonna go global? Or is that just this one guy who thinks maybe it would be nice someday to go global?` And you have to figure that out.  Yeah, it's a Chinese client. And I'm still not sure we've completely recovered from that. Because, it's really weird how one comment can be made and it just has this ripple effect through a whole project. Like, `Really, we're gonna go global? Or is that just this one guy who thinks maybe it would be nice someday to go global?` And you have to figure that out. So that was one whole dimension of it. And then the other is like the TCL, in the span as less than a year they've grown as a part of our business to be a really significant client for IDEO. And as a result, obviously Michelle here is very engaged in managing that relationship. And Andy Switke is very invested in owning that relationship. And David Nicholson, who was here and is now in Palo Alto and who led last year's design project, is very invested in it. And all of a sudden there's this whole group of senior IDEO people who wanna be associated client, it's becoming a big success story. And none of them speak Chinese, with the exception of Michelle. And everyone has their own point of view about what's right for the client, but nobody's really that intimately connected with the client. And we don't have the personal relationship, I think because of the language barriers, that I don't think we really understand them as well as we understand most of our key clients. t. And we don't have the personal relationship, I think because of the language barriers, that I don't think we really understand them as well as we understand most of our key clients. It was crazy. Especially towards the end when we were putting together the presentation. We were happy with and we reviewed it with one group and got one set of feedback. And we changed it, we reviewed it with another group, and they thought something completely different. And there's just way too many people. And then the fact that future projects that we were proposing were sort of deriving out of the work that I was doing meant that Michelle became a decision-maker, everything we did had to align with what she was proposing. Richard as being the new head of Shanghai, and the brand, and the guy who's gonna inherit this relationship, became invested. And he wanted to have a say in everything. Ofer as the current lead here, rightfully insisted on reviewing what we were doing, but ... It's a challenge to assert yourself as project manager with him, sometimes. Because he expects all of his contributions to be incorporated. Whereas as project manager, I need to solicit this input, filter it, prioritize it, and communicate some of it, not all of it, to my team. So that's what we gave them, I think we were successful in that. The client I think was a little bit frustrated. Not in that we weren't giving them what they wanted, but that we were doing all this work, and we still haven't talked about what this TV is gonna look like. And they just struggled with that idea. Like `Aren't we gonna design some TVs?` It's like, `Yeah, we're gonna design some TVs, but you know, first let's figure out-` And then when I got here it was another month of `All right we gotta get this proposal signed, what's the hang-up, what's the work plan, what's the logistics of this?` I have never been part of a proposal that had that many man-hours gone into it. And we've been talking about this for two months. Couldn't this have come up some time in the past two months when we were negotiating this contract? And then I'm told by Michelle, `Well it's not about the contract, it's about the relationship.` And okay, maybe I'm starting to appreciate that. I didn't appreciate that at all at the time. At the time I was just freaking out because I didn't know how I was gonna run this project at this point. So yeah, time was probably more tight than budget. But both of them we had to renegotiate when the scope change was dropped on us on day one. We're like, well whatever happens we're not gonna go international at all in this amount of time. So we negotiated a few more weeks and another $100,000 or something like that. They didn't object to it. Very quickly we said we can re-scope this, but it's certainly a change of scope and we need to treat it accordingly. And they seemed okay with that. But even on TCL. I guess both of these clients ... well TCL more so. TCL is like, `Okay, we'll see you at the next meeting. When's our next presentation, four weeks from now? Okay, we'll see you then, call us if you need us.` And they're just expecting us to go off and work our magic. My current client, Fotile, they're kind of like IDEO groupies, they've read the books, they've seen the shopping car video. And I think they're very interested in our process. And every time there's a meeting set up I say, `Bring two or three people` and eight show up. Because so many people are interested, and they wanna see what's going on. They're expecting the IDEO magic, because that's all they've read about and they don't understand that the process is not always as pretty or as exciting as the end result on our famous happy ending stories seems to be. TCL was exhausting for me because it was a relatively junior team, and especially as we started recruiting help form other offices it was a very far-flung team. And so I don't even know that I even spoke to everybody who was on my team. Delegate to different people in different locations and trust that they'll recruit the right people to make things happen. So it was a very far-flung, very loosely knit team on TCL. Which didn't help when it came time to tighten things up and bring things back under control. This is in contrast to my current project where we've got more experienced people on the team. Very solid core team, relatively focused set of efforts. We've got the right resources to get the job done, we know what we're doing and we know who's gonna do what. And I think everybody knows what's expected of them and that makes the personal relationships on the team that much easier to manage, because everybody knows what's expected of them on this very far-flung TCL project. Like I said, we got knocked off balance and never really recovered. And frankly, I think we're kind of lucky that it's not a really sophisticated client when it comes to branding and design strategy. They're in the mode of a Chinese manufacturer, which is `Let's go rip off Samsung and crank something out that kind of copies them, we'll sell it for a little bit less, and that's our strategy.` But I sort of get it, but on the other hand it's about the relationship, `Please by all means tell us what you're thinking so that we can try to accommodate you.` Yeah. And I think from what I've seen that's a pattern here in Shanghai. And I don't know that ... I think part of it is that our BD people here, they were brought in externally, aren't real intimate with actually what we do in the content side on these projects. And there's still a lot of learning there. And using examples like that to show this company, `Look, it's not about price as you've been thinking about it, it's about something else, it's about your users and how they wanna use your products.` So we used Apple, we used Toyota, with their, they've got the Toyota brand, they've got the Scion brand, they've got the ... what is it, Infinity? I can never remember. Anyway, they've got their different brands and they segment not just on price but on other ways people think about their cars. And then the next thing you know, you spent two weeks figuring all this out. And it's very unclear how this decision is being made and what's supposed to be driving it and how we can help them come to the right decision. So we just went on with our plan as it was, originally, what we wrote the proposal for. My current client, Fotile, they're kind of like IDO groupies, they've read the books, they've seen the shopping car video. And I think they're very interested in our process. And every time there's a meeting set up I say, `Bring two or three people` and eight show up. Because so many people are interested, and they wanna see what's going on. They're expecting the IDO magic, because that's all they've read about and they don't understand that the process is not always as pretty or as exciting as the end result on our famous happy ending stories seems to be. And it's like, `Is it even possible for you guys to launch this in Europe next year? We don't really think that your company is actually able to do that. So are we gonna really design for that? No.` And then it's like, `Well wait, you want these products done by June? Really? Well if you want us to go global, if we're really gonna do a global research program, seriously that's like six more weeks of research. Do you really want us to do that? Because it's gonna blow your whole schedule, and we don't think you're gonna be able to do it anyway.` And these guys kind of get it that they need to rise above that, but they have no idea what it means to do that, and they're looking to us to help them do that. And we're fumbling a little bit I think with them. We've got growing pains. We've got growing pains here in Shanghai and in China, and we don't have the infrastructure in place to manage that kind of project and that scope of relationship out of this office. To which our response was, `Well, that's one way to look at it, but that's not really how we would look at it. You segment it that way, and the only thing you're telling me is this one's more expensive than that one.` And our main goal was to give them a behavioral segmentation. To say here's a group of that looked at their TV in these terms. And here's a group of people who looked at their TV in this way. And here's how you can consider designing to how these people think about their TVs, not just how much they think they wanna spend for their TV. Which was just ... You just can't do it. You need somebody who's effective at prioritizing and synthesizing, and directing our team from their point of view. So Oscar's not particularly effective. Hon Ching is okay, but every time Hon Ching shows up his whole entourage of 30 mid-level managers shows up. And all of a sudden there's this whole group of senior IDO people who wanna be associated client, it's becoming a big success story. And none of them speak Chinese, with the exception of Michelle. And everyone has their own point of view about what's right for the client, but nobody's really that intimately connected with the client. And we don't have the personal relationship, I think because of the language barriers, that I don't think we really understand them as well as we understand most of our key clients. And we have good proposals, like, `Here is the work plan, this is what's gonna happen this week, this is what's gonna happen this week, this is what we're gonna give you. When we're halfway through we're gonna show you this.` And it was all there, and then we get to the kick-off and it's like, `Oh we wanna go international.` Or maybe my client person just decides to informally chat with my Chinese designer, or my Chinese-speaking researcher, or Vivian our translator, and those communications don't come back to me necessarily. And it's very difficult as a PM to sort of stay on top of what the client's asking for, what the client has been promised. Managing communication is super tough. All right. And then the language barrier of course makes it very difficult to dig down into these thing. Because you're like, `Really, did you just say what the translator says you just said?` So it's sort of the blind leading the blind, and way too many cooks in the kitchen. And when some red flag gets raised over here and this person reacts, and this person who it affects has no idea what's going on, that's led to some anxiety-ridden times, I think, with that client. But both at TCL and my current project I think we were initially scoped very aggressively. Not taking into account the amount of time it takes to prepare these nice reports that we like to prepare for our clients. And what it really takes to do research in four cities or whatever, it's not just a matter of four cities, two days per city, that's an eight-day project, right? It's like, `Well no.` On a good day that's what would happen. What would usually happen was everybody in TCL who had a concern about this project would come to Oscar, which was the right thing to do. But instead of Oscar being an effective point person where we could just communicate and negotiate with him, he really just became a sort of cruise director and was like, `You guys need to come down here. I'm gonna set up 12 meetings over two days for you guys to come and say the same thing over and over again to all these different people, and you're supposed to collect all their feedback and put it into your project.` And you present to him, and then you solicit feedback, and nobody says anything until Hon Ching says something, and then everybody nods and says, `Yeah, what he said.` And in Beijing, there's no real back and forth. It's just sort of, wisdom is spoken from on high. And then you really can't dig any deeper than that. And then we get to the kick-off, and the client lead is like, `Oh yeah, we want this to be a global project.` Like, `What do you mean you want it to be a global project?` `We want you to do research all around the world, and these products are gonna be launched globally, so it's gotta be global.` And ... And we scrambled and got some people in Munich to go out and look at some people in Europe. And we got some people in California to go out and look at some people in America. But they weren't comprehensive research programs, they were just quick hits, and feed us some information and we'll see if we can make some sense of it. And I'm still not quite sure to what end. But instantly, that was the kick-off. And it kind of knocked me off balance, and I feel like we never really quite recovered. So you get buffeted, and you're staggering through the project trying to find your center again, and then the next thing you know, it's over. And you kind of have this thing, and you're not quite sure if it's what people wanted, and you're not quite sure if it makes sense. And you kind of have this thing, and you're not quite sure if it's what people wanted, and you're not quite sure if it makes sense. But everybody had their own little element of the relationship that they were trying to protect and grown and nurture. But I won't say nobody was in the position of trying to coordinate all the various activities for this client, but the person who was was over-stretched and unable to stay engaged well enough to be effective. And so that's really what my part of the project was all about. And we gave them a framework that identified four other groups, and we can say, `You can think of this one as being the super high premium segment, but this is what they really care about. And let's think about that when we're designing the TV.` And likewise, `Here's a group, maybe this is gonna fit in your mid-level pricing tier, but don't think about it that way, think about it in terms of how these people relate to their televisions and what they wanna do with their TVs, and where they put them in their home.` We'll get there, but we're kind of lucky that this is a little bit of a naïve client and we can afford to make some mistakes as we go along. And we can give them deliverables that might not thrill a client like Sony or Samsung, but are perfectly adequate for this client, and it gets them to be able to take the next step on their journey. So we're helping them, but we ourselves could use some help in organizing ourselves and organizing our resources to better help this client, I think. Too many. I should've been the in-house decision-maker. And I sort of was for my little piece of the project. I tried to keep it self-contained, and manage the scope, and effectively manage decisions for what I had been asked to do. But the fact that it was one phase of a four-phase project that was gonna get handed off to Palo Alto meant that I had to keep that group in the loop. eah, it's a Chinese client. And I'm still not sure we've completely recovered from that. Because, it's really weird how one comment can be made and it just has this ripple effect through a whole project. Like, `Really, we're gonna go global? Or is that just this one guy who thinks maybe it would be nice someday to go global?` And you have to figure that out.   Distant. The language thing has been super tough for me. And that was with a client where my main contact spoke English. Now I have a client where my main contact barely speaks English. He prefers to communicate by email in Chinese. And so I can't call her on the phone, I can't dash off an email. I have to compose a letter and have it translated by Vivian and then sent off. And then it comes back through Vivian. I think I'm deviating from your question, but the relationships have been difficult to manage and often very difficult to read expectations. And very difficult to set expectations, as a corollary to that.",

    "text": "So that team was also coaching the new wave of clients about IDEO's processes and how IDEO looks at innovation and some of the tools that these guys could use to become more innovative. But the thing that was really nice, is the client was really keen, so keen to be innovative. And the main key client that chose IDEO, was also really keen that we were creative and came up with new ways of doing things. So when we get prototyping, financial services, they were like, “Oh, lets try it.” They were also applying what we were teaching them to their day to day work. So we got them participating in brainstorms, and then asked them to actually run some brainstorms themselves. And they were like, “Okay, cool. We can do this.” And then they were sending back brainstorm sketches of ideas because we were like, “You shouldn't write down just what it is, you should try and illustrate it as well.” So they were emailing back pictures of Post-it notes that they had had from their brainstorms that were actual visuals. So it was really interesting that they were so keen, and they were kind of being given the permission to take these tools that we were teaching them and apply them to other things that they would then come into meeting going, `Yeah, look at this. The idea for my other project. Look at this.` So it was quite, but I think if that was kind of, because it was such a large core team, as well as having that one team that could help the client navigate what we're taking them through, it allowed us to work a lot smarter. And the nice thing was, cause we had two simultaneous projects, we managed to keep the deliverable that we gave them at the end, match it to their expect... Between the two teams, so the two IDEO teams delivered two very similar ways of presenting the works, even though we might not have actually coordinated deliverables across those two projects.

Between the two teams, so the two IDEO teams delivered two very similar ways of presenting the works, even though we might not have actually coordinated deliverables across those two projects. Three different teams that were three to four, full time. There were, then each of those teams really had another business factors' person that was pretty part-time. Mainly because the budgets wouldn't actually allow for business factors to be on full-time. And then other people, as and when we needed them. So we might pull in another extra couple of communication designers towards the end, to help communicate things. And actually towards the end-end, we also had directors that were creating videos for us. We had script writers writing copy for us, and writing scripts. So we kind of, towards the end we pulled in a lot more people to actually help us create the final thing. We had photographers and it became much more of a production thing than normal projects are, because we were trying to keep the same level. But also create deliverables the client could present, that didn't matter how they were presented, same details. Cause it was almost like clicking play on a video and everything communicated itself. So we continually, and also because they are Italian, by nature we had this whole thing where we had to get the project managers to say yes. And the core team to say yes. Kirsten also had to say yes. And then we also had to get the buy-in for at least one of those two. And the interesting thing was we came up with two big ideas, and of these two one liked one and one liked the other. And actually in the final presentation, they were both standing up to each other about their favorite idea. And the interesting thing was we came up with two big ideas, and of these two one liked one and one liked the other. And actually in the final presentation, they were both standing up to each other about their favorite idea. Again, at times it felt like there were too many. I'm trying to think. There was the project manager, and the core team. There were, so there were three, four of us on our team. But then we had weekly reviews with practice leadership. So they had opinion. So it was quite strange from that point of view actually. Looking, now you can ask that question because at the time it felt it was really, I think that was one of the things that was really hard. Because no one really felt that they were the key decision maker. Even the project manager still felt like he had to get the practice leadership to agree with our thinking. So as a team, also seeing that we had some role in helping work out what was the right decision, but then no one quite knowing what was the right decision. I think that's the one thing, cause with our team structure is, even if you have a project manager who's the overall decision maker, it's the guys who are actually doing the work, when you've only got a core team of three or four people, those people have... I think the project manager tried really hard to make those people feel like they were also involved in decision making process. So, cause we're trying to work out what's right for the client rather than what's right for us. Everyone's opinions always gathered and then it was almost, kind of, do decision by committee. So, cause we're trying to work out what's right for the client rather than what's right for us. Everyone's opinions always gathered and then it was almost, kind of, do decision by committee. I think that's the one thing, cause with our team structure is, even if you have a project manager who's the overall decision maker, it's the guys who are actually doing the work, when you've only got a core team of three or four people, those people have... I think the project manager tried really hard to make those people feel like they were also involved in decision making process. But I think, again, those five or six decision makers were also trying to always make decisions collaboratively. But not necessarily always having the same amounts of time, at the same time. So everyone was always like, `Oh I just had this new piece of information that I think it will impact this.` So there were lots of different decisions that were being made. So I was making some decisions about the research and, but those decisions were key on some of the stuff that was happening with the project manager that, and the clients project manager, the internal project manager. And the things were happening with, at this level, with practice leadership was communicating with these guys and trying to. So there were lots, whilst they were kind of, cause they were different levels. There were different people that were trying to get decisions, and making decisions, and then you were trying to then get those all in alignment to the same decision. The interesting thing was because this was so future looking, it almost felt a bit like they were, whilst they were really keen and they were like, “Yeah, we could be creative. We can do all these different things.” Whether or not they would have actually been able to implement anything, that level of decision making and risk taking wasn't clear. So you never actually quite understood whether or not they would. Whilst they were talking the talk as if they had a very low risk tolerance, I don't think they were. What physically is possible in terms of, we had some cool ideas about breaking insurance down, so you're insuring just one event. So it's a very small insurance package. And they were like, “Oh, great, great.” But you still kind of knew that they weren't actually convinced that it would physically be possible. But I think that was mainly not because they wanted to be. It was the fact the industry they worked in almost limited them to that. We did some testing with consumers. But we were above the level of actually going to implement things. This was very much looking for strategic opportunities. Cause a lot of our ideas meant starting a new business. Like starting a bank. They were that scale of innovation. So it was, we abstracted it into two, the youth and the migrant's opportunity areas. And then the actual specific scope of the projects, we defined by running a collaborative workshop with the 25 stakeholders, where we discussed what we could do with the project. And then got them to discuss their thinking and try to, collaboratively, with 25 people and I think it was like six of us, seven of us, what the project was gonna be about. Which I don't think I would ever do again. I would try and do it with a small core team of people. Or be a lot, have a stronger opinion of what we wanted the project to be about before we started. But it was kind of starting from scratch were there's not, with a buy-in group of 25 people, that wanted to actually feel like they'd made the decision. So that all happened with the practice leadership before I joined. In terms of redefining actually the opportunity areas. And we did a workshop with them, or with some of them, to actually explore some of these areas before the actual kick off. So I don't know exactly what happened in that, but I think that was more, again, of a information sharing. To work out some wider possibilities that youth and the nomads were the ones that they wanted to focus on. No. And actually the one nice thing was, time wise, we'd actually scoped it so it was realistic. Because we knew that we'd had this 25 people that we needed to get buy-in from the whole time, an extra couple of weeks had been added to each of the phases, to get that buy-in. Which was quite nice. So we had a bit more time than, it wasn't as tight as a lot of projects I've worked on. And actually budget was quite flexible, which I think was key to the fogginess of the project. And I think that was nice when the budget isn't tight you can just go, `Let's do that today. Or should we do that on Thursday? We can't make a decision about which of these is right, lets get some other people, experts in and get them to help us do things.` So from that point of view, I think, but also I think the project manager was really good at making sure the budget side of things, we didn't really. It's like, `Yeah, no, we've got the funds for that. Just don't work for more than 40 hours this week.` I don't know. I think it was interesting because we had such big business factors input, but it was really guided by not only what we heard, it was mostly pay-in to consumers about, cause it was what was really desirable to consumers. But also what worked, what were the biggest opportunities for them as the client. So financially, what were the biggest rewards for them. So what was gonna be, but also what was easiest for them to implement. Although we did, I suppose, the feasibility was the thing that was given the least consideration. It was mainly what was desirable and what was viable. So there were quite a few ideas that were sort of a bit desirable, where we had to work out how to make them viable. I'm not sure we can. So if it didn't make money it was like, “We've gotta find a way of making it money. We've gotta creatively come up with.” And I think that's the one thing that's always very difficult, is when you bring in the guys that actually help with that, in terms of working out if things are, how to make things viable. So it was really interesting that they were so keen, and they were kind of being given the permission to take these tools that we were teaching them and apply them to other things that they would then come into meeting going, `Yeah, look at this. The idea for my other project. Look at this.` So it was quite, but I think if that was kind of, because it was such a large core team, as well as having that one team that could help the client navigate what we're taking them through, it allowed us to work a lot smarter. And the nice thing was, cause we had two simultaneous projects, we managed to keep the deliverable that we gave them at the end, match it to their expect... Between the two teams, so the two IDO teams delivered two very similar ways of presenting the works, even though we might not have actually coordinated deliverables across those two projects. Everyone's opinions always gathered and then it was almost, kind of, do decision by committee. What I worked on last, in London, actually was really interesting. Because whilst we were doing it, it felt like an uphill struggle, and that it wasn't clicking. Some of the team dynamics were difficult. The content area was really difficult. But we did, I think as a result, despite the clashes and the fact we were all so emotionally drained at the end of the 20 weeks, what we actually managed to deliver, kind of canceled out all the pain that the previous 20 weeks had been. Because we came out with some really cool solutions that were really well communicated and the kind of client really loved them. So I think that was quite interesting. What we came out with was really good, but getting there was very, very painful. Some of the opportunity areas or opportunity backers. So we're seeing ideas come into. Like in our actually research, we didn't look at rewards schemes, but we suddenly realize that to actually engage with youth we're gonna need to come up with some ideas that do reward people. And we did a workshop with them, or with some of them, to actually explore some of these areas before the actual kick off. So I don't know exactly what happened in that, but I think that was more, again, of a information sharing. To work out some wider possibilities that youth and the nomads were the ones that they wanted to focus on. So we just organized a focus group with a group of young people and a group of parents on the kind of rewards schemes, what are the benefits? What are good reward schemes? What are bad reward schemes? To just kind of help give us some better ideas. And we actually did some kind of getting consumers to help us brainstorm and built on some of the initial ideas we had. were also applying what we were teaching them to their day to day work. So we got them participating in brainstorms, and then asked them to actually run some brainstorms themselves. And they were like, “Okay, cool. We can do this.” And then they were sending back brainstorm sketches of ideas because we were like, “You shouldn't write down just what it is, you should try and illustrate it as well.” So they were emailing back pictures of Post-it notes that they had had from their brainstorms that were actual visuals. Yeah. It was, we did some kind of initial, for in the water type testing. But what I think's actually happening at the moment essentially is, we're talking to them about trying to actually look at prototyping some of these ideas, and actually on a high level. So actually faking some of the interactions or actually creating a kind of, simulating it through what they already have. Or creating actually a real working prototype and actually trialing it in a small market. But I think that's the problem of trying to innovate within financial services, is to be innovative, you have to forget all the rules on how business is done as normal. Kind of, what is the legal way things have to be done? And you should almost push that all to the side, come up with some innovative solutions and then try and map back on what legislation says you can and can't do. Because no one really felt that they were the key decision maker. Even the project manager still felt like he had to get the practice leadership to agree with our thinking. So as a team, also seeing that we had some role in helping work out what was the right decision, but then no one quite knowing what was the right decision. PROJECT ID It's kind of, that one it was, it never felt like it was ever gonna come together. Or that the team was ever gonna agree on the same direction. A lot of the time we were arguing about the same thing, just in different languages. Which was quite interesting, because the team not only spoke different design thinking. So we had interaction designers, more visual designers, more human designers. And the fact we were all from different European countries, it was this kind of we were all trying to articulate the thing in the same way, but not using any of the same words, so we all think we're trying to disagree with each other.   Well I think that was the nice thing about them as a client was that they were open to us saying, “We don't think this is gonna give you what you want out of it.” So that team was also coaching the new wave of clients about IDO's processes and how IDO looks at innovation and some of the tools that these guys could use to become more innovative. But the thing that was really nice, is the client was really keen, so keen to be innovative. And the main key client that chose IDO, was also really keen that we were creative and came up with new ways of doing things. I think they wanted to focus on building existing relationships, leveraging existing customers, and eCommerce. And we were like, `That's quite limiting in terms of innovation.` So those originally were two separate projects they wanted to run. We combined them and said, `Let's look at youth.` Because youth actually have, their parents tend to be the ones involved with financial services.",

I think the ... we have several fractions that made me a little bit stressful, not so happy. I think one problem is client. This is the first time for IDEO to work with TCL, trying this T.V. manufacturer. They not quite understanding our design process and all this change, all this change. Even at the, even almost close to the end of this project, they want, `Oh, I wanna change this appearance. I wanna change the size.` Wow, that is a problem. How do you do that? Yeah, I don't know, and I had very, very, very detailed experience with client. The management structure is I'm forward, I send some feedback to our project leader or someone managing this project, then they forward it to the TCL end, and then they responded to the project leader, then the project leader sends response to me. Why don't let me communicate with them directly? I can do that. I don't think I get enough information from project leaders [inaudible 00:25:19]. About my process.

If the client is more familiar with our design process, maybe the budget and timing are okay, but they aren't. I think this is a problem combined with time, budgeting, client's side. Too many change and to be honest, I did learn something from this project to cooperate with Chinese companies and I think client, on their end, they also missed something. I think one problem is client, client is way harder to deal with, but this may be a very nice one. Just don't fit our design process. I think at the ending phase, yeah, but intermediate stage is not a problem, anyone has seen. We receive too many changes from clients. It made everyone have little bit crazy.

It didn't go well at the end, but it went pretty well, content wise, while I did a [RHF 00:30:19], but while I did [RHF 00:30:21], I was super tired and then I felt that project wasn't well managed at all. And also, it's not sketched proper as well, so it's really like chicken and egg because based on the quality of the content, we didn't have enough resource. , I feel I need to take beautiful roles and then finish all the things just by myself, and that was super tired. And then, during the project, also because lack of resource Then, maybe Andy can tell you more story about Flash because he handled the last bigger bit which is we had to determine the project because our client didn't want to pay. The thing is, because they didn't really have budget, so they could only afford three weeks of research, so that means one week preparation, another week to do the research, and the third week is to synthesize plus the documentation. And then, because it's for the U.S. market, so we need to go to the State. Also, because short of budget, only me can fly to the State to carry out the research. At that time, I need to find another partner in the State to help me do the research because we have to have two people instead of one people to go to people's house. So, that's the case. Supposedly, two, but during HF phase, they didn't really give any feedback and then the key client, he actually fall asleep during the presentation, although I believe it's not boring at all. Then, he just like fall asleep, so that's very annoying. he actually fall asleep during the presentation, although I believe it's not boring at all. Then, he just like fall asleep, so that's very annoying. That would be ... Besides me and Jesse [Ofair 00:36:09], was also involved, because I think Jesse, as the Project Manager, he's a very good engineer, but he's a very unexperienced Content Manager in the HF phase, so he's more like a budget controller. He can barely give any suggestions, or very few suggestions how to make decisions in terms of HF. Zero. It was actually very funny because when they came to us for those two flashlights, they all described and said they want something very unique. Different from anything in the market and for the open ended one it would be have never seen before, so that's what we did and then we realized first, for those really open ended ones, we didn't really have experience to make judgment, so basically their judgment is based on their vendor. Their buyer, so they expected the buyer will give them the feedback; however, buyer were not capable of doing that. When the buyer sees those very open ended ones, because they're also not really mentioning two people, they just give very negative feedback. t was actually very funny because when they came to us for those two flashlights, they all described and said they want something very unique.

Their buyer, so they expected the buyer will give them the feedback; however, buyer were not capable of doing that. When the buyer sees those very open ended ones, because they're also not really mentioning two people, they just give very negative feedback. Oh, yeah. Mentioned about testing. Originally our assumption is they're going to test those concepts with their buyers, but because they just gave our rough TD drawings to the buyers and the buyers, usually the only thing they saw were the concrete physical products, so they felt oh, the concept really sucks, and they couldn't understand those 2D drawings, too. So, we were joking and say oh, yeah. Probably we need to pick a really strange time to talk to that guy so that guy will thought we were calling from the State. Both of them were really tight. The client didn't accept that because he regard as more like from a manufacturer point of view rather than a service provider, so we didn't put anything forward at the end. And then, during the project, also because lack of resource, I feel I need to take beautiful roles and then finish all the things just by myself, and that was super tired. Then, maybe Andy can tell you more story about Flash because he handled the last bigger bit which is we had to determine the project because our client didn't want to pay. Originally, they respected us in the hope we can help them to earn three hundred billions back by selling on flashlight, so they regard to work with us although we were expensive, but it going to be a very profitable investment. At the end, they hate us, and they feel we were cheating them, so our relationship just sucks. Andy probably can tell you more stories because the client yelled to him and say lots of dirty words. Anyway, we did refine this and, I guess, add part of a engineering effort to it, but at that time, the client started to argue about the fee because they said they asked us to decrease the money because we are not going to deliver the other one, that extreme open ended one. For our perspective, yes, we can charge you less because we're going to do less work, but not the one. The work has already happened. From the actual point is from the people's behavior, so we studied the user's in the State and realized this is a very friendly shape in terms of where to give this stub a home or a temporary home because it's not rounded. It won't rolling around in your drawer. It was real interesting because while Jesse, our Project Manager, called the buyer and tried to do the same thing, he basically used 13 minutes to convince the buyer that we are not IDEO counterfeit in China. At the very end, the buyer say okay, I believe you. You are legitimate company, but he still didn't believe we were IDEO. but he's a very unexperienced Content Manager in the HF phase, so he's more like a budget controller. He can barely give any suggestions, or very few suggestions how to make decisions in terms of HF. Supposedly, two, but during [HF 00:35:29] phase, they didn't really give any feedback and then the key client, he actually fall asleep during the presentation, although I believe it's not boring at all. Then, he just like fall asleep, so that's very annoying. Then, we also realized the client didn't understand our process at all so probably that would be a offset scenario. At that point, the client just go really crazy like oh, no, IDEO really sucks. You need to re-done all the projects. All the flashlights, and then at the end, first of all they drop the extremely open ended ones because they didn't know how to deal with it and then, for that traditional flashlight, they couldn't really find a buyer to give a legible feedback or useful feedback so the buyer just ... Their buyer, so they expected the buyer will give them the feedback; however, buyer were not capable of doing that. When the buyer sees those very open ended ones, because they're also not really mentioning two people, they just give very negative feedback. We felt surprised because we didn't expect that's the way he going to interact with the buyer, and the buyer only had two minutes to look at those things, so the buyer didn't really have time to think about how they are going to use those concepts. I heard one other business model IDEO, in the stated, was the Chinese manufacturer will find the IDEO in other location and then leverage IDEO's fame and then while they pitch to those buyers, there was oh, by the way, IDEO is designing for us, so that gave them the credential.   So they go really like panic and then we tried to explain our process to them. This is iterate process and you need to give feedback and refine the concept, but not jump to the end in one step, but they couldn't' understand that and didn't want to accept, and they don't want to cooperate as well, so that's why we failed.",

    "text": "Although they said they had very big tolerance, but in reality, I think it's not because they regarded IDEO as we're a class consultant and they spent a huge amount of money on us. It is my impression that while we visited their company to do the presentation, they always get a huge conference room and the whole company come over to that room. I'm exaggerating, but it's like 40-something people from all the key people or the most successful employers from each division to participate the presentation. Then, they will always tend to, from my perspective based on their manufacturing capability, and also based on their maturity in terms of handling branding and their business, it's better to provide them something lower risk because you providing something really special. They can handle it. Yeah. The phase two part is still in Palo Alto and they are working on ... Actually, sometimes, I feel they don't really have the capability to react to the research part because, basically, they are not sophisticated in terms of marketing and branding and they barely had any marketing research department at all, so every time our experience, like a comer is me or Lucy, went to them and give them presentation and they go like oh, wow. That's interesting. Hm. All right. Because it actually is the third project we did for TCL. The first one we did was just about premium T.V. It's called [Redox 00:21:31] and the second one was called Retail. Viva was the third one, so to that point, we already understand part of their company's expectations and their goals and in the project brief ... I feel it's okay. Yeah. It's not that tight. There's a reason why I picked that project because the rest of the projects I did were very tight. But, the only pity I felt is the budget wise. We didn't have enough budget to involve the whole team all the time. So, I'll describe you a sequence of who joined and who leave. One important thing is, I felt, is to show ideas to people and to contemplate what that means. Also, within a very short period of time, brainstorming around that topic, but for this it's more like we know where our goal is and we just marched toward it. We didn't really have much space to think out of the box or to talk about it. It more like everybody did their own thing and put them together at the very end. I felt, because it's our third project we did for them, so they already started to feel familiar with us and feel us less threatening, especially, for example, their industrial design has. So, that's a good part. I'll say it's pretty good because I remember when I did Redux, which is the first project the head of industrial designer, she came with me and then that time her attitude was very challenging. And she will said there's nothing interesting from the field, but during Viva, she quite enjoy it. Then, I actually realized her attitude changed and then she more see IDEO as a partner to cooperate with instead of to compete against.  I feel they don't really have the capability to react to the research part because, basically, they are not sophisticated in terms of marketing and branding and they barely had any marketing research department at all, so every time our experience, like a comer is me or Lucy, went to them and give them presentation and they go like oh, wow. That's interesting. Hm. All right. So, they were almost like looking up at us like looking at some hero and then they want to learn from that hero and dream maybe one day they can become the hero or, at least, something similar to the hero, so they all want to learn something from us. I think our main sponsor, he gave us lots of trust, but that trust will not fail. Then, one day, with IDEO's help, they can become as good as Samsung, so I would say it's very well.  felt, because it's our third project we did for them, so they already started to feel familiar with us and feel us less threatening, especially, for example, their industrial design has. So, that's a good part. I'll say it's pretty good because I remember when I did Redux, which is the first project the head of industrial designer, she came with me and then that time her attitude was very challenging. And she will said there's nothing interesting from the field, but during Viva, she quite enjoy it. Then, I actually realized her attitude changed and then she more see IDEO as a partner to cooperate with instead of to compete against. It's for our key client TCL and then what we are going to deliver, first of all, is to help to sell to supplement their products from a user behavioral point of view. At the same time, we also did lots of looking in sessions and to understand what the company's capabilities are. So for those two aspect. Also, we need to give suggestions of some complementary accessories, so that's the project is about. I think that's something very interesting because although they signed the contract, but when we did the workshop in Palo Alto, they all of a sudden proposed other 10 things they also want to do. Originally, the project was focused on China and then, during the workshop, they say oh, by the way, we are also interested in France. Now they just say we are also interested in Europe and the U.S.A. Can you also do research for us in those two areas? And then, besides the product segmentation, can you do the brand part at the same time, and that's how we push back. We did enlarge our research group scope to incorporate France and U.S.A. briefly, but we didn't do the brand part. We still focused on T.V., but I felt that also declined. They didn't really think through what they accept and then when they feel excited, they will suggest something else. And they will give more ... the feedback will increase while the process go into later phases. So, for example, if it's start to have something visual, they will have more things to interact with, and even later, for a simply manufacturing process, they will suddenly become expert and they don't want to accept our suggestions. I think, basically, our learning from people and also from the discussion with the teams because, for example, Suzanne, she came from the State and then she had many other project experiences, so she can enlarge our territory while we did a discussion. So, the information from people isn't the only source we have, and also we learned a lot from talking to the client as well as from our design study.   So, from my side, they are always very happy, but for me, at the very beginning, I feel disappointed because I feel they didn't give me any feedback. And then, gradually, I realized it's not because they don't want, just they can't, so I feel our role here is more like to tell the client direction instead of asked or cultivate the direction with them. After the research phase, the designers in Palo Alto, they can take those things we found out to further develop their ideas and concepts around that. So, for example, Ken, the Project Manager, or the industrial designers, they come on their team all the time and they always come in and out while they have time or we have extra resource to put them on the team. Also, we need to split and do many things in parallel without proper time to sit down together and do something together because I mentioned about creativity.",

We help them to keep very good relationship with the supplier, because they're a very small company and IDEO is a company with very good reputation. We help them to build a relationship with the supplier. Without IDEO I don't think the supplier will work with this company. Every time we had some request we just responded to the client very quickly. Because the client don't have an engineering team, so IDEO always have some engineers available for their quick, how to say, short time notice. Kind of yeah. I mean in Shanghai, we're just a small team here, we can get on with each other very well. And in Palo Alto we have another team, they are... in IDEO maybe you don't know, manufacturing team, most of them are very experienced and they're very respectable and high tiered in IDEO. On this project, the team in Palo alto is very strong, and they are very old. Like 50 or 60 years old. They can get along very well, and they respect each other very well. Every time we have some disagreements, just sit down with each other and get it fixed. On this project, the team in Palo alto is very strong, and they are very old. Like 50 or 60 years old. They can get along very well, and they respect each other very well. Every time we have some disagreements, just sit down with each other and get it fixed.   So my responsibility here is first to help the designers, the ID or mechanical designers, to make their design more manufacture-able. Sometimes when they design products, they just randomly design and get some ideas. But it's very possible when they finish their design or when we review their designs, we find oh it's not going to work. We cannot make it. So I need to help them to make sure the design is feasible, it's make-able. And secondly, I will have the project clients who look for and locate confine suppliers in Asia area.",

It's very new in China, and in San Francisco they just take it for granted, they think it's very easy. Not very big, because our coworkers in San Francisco [crosstalk 00:20:22] budget is very tight, yeah. Very tight. Too tight, yeah. No time either. So the clients were very hard to deal with, and they changed their minds again and again. You know, maybe today we agreed on something and we start to spend some time working on that. Tomorrow, you know the clients, `oh, I didn't say that. You need to change that`. So he gave us very hard time, we need to bother our supplier again and again. The project very hard and the supplier would not like to work on this kind of project because volume very low. Won't make big money. Based on that situation we still changed our design again and again, so it makes the supplier very angry, and then give us very hard time. You make a competition between ours and the supplier very hard. The client was not very consistent. Yeah I don't think it's good. For this project, if a coworker in San Francisco shared more information with us earlier we probably can do it much better. At least we can advise them earlier, you know, we cannot make it in China.

I spent a long time looking for suppliers around China but finally, none of them can make the prototype very well, and we said sorry to the client. We said we cannot make it in China, and another supplier from Italy get our design to Europe and get them made there. So I think the client was not very happy. I think it's very bad to me, to IDEO either. Yes, in 2006 I worked on a project a client is from Italy. So our project is about some messenger bags, [inaudible 00:17:56] bags, and IDEO helped them with the design from San Francisco and Shanghai. Me help them look for suppliers gets their prototype out. Because when IDEO San Francisco start the design, they didn't notice ours. We didn't know what they are working, and we didn't know it was this kind of project we all need to work on. Here in San Francisco, they think their designs are very cool and we can make it in China, but when they transferred the design package to ours, we found we cannot find the supplier to work on this project in China because that process.

For this project, if a coworker in San Francisco shared more information with us earlier we probably can do it much better. At least we can advise them earlier, you know, we cannot make it in China. I think they got some inspiration from the swimming suit, or from... Many people who would like to go camping and swim on the mountains, camp, and even it's raining, they can wear it and waterproof jacket right? Waterproof jacket walking in the rain. They got some inspiration from. Want to design some bags which are waterproofing as well, and you can put the bag in water. The water cannot go into the bag, the bag protects the stuff inside very well.   You know, when one of my coworkers Jessie moved back to Palo Alto, and I had a phone conference with the client. The way that the client talk is not very polite. Because you know, French when they speak English is very hard to understand. We ask them to repeat it, and they kind of were not patient. Oh can I say this in this way? o the clients were very hard to deal with, and they changed their minds again and again. You know, maybe today we agreed on something and we start to spend some time working on that. Tomorrow, you know the clients, `oh, I didn't say that. You need to change that`.

    "location": "Shanghai",
    "text": "Basically, I have to say it's unfair, 'cause we lost money on this project. Partly, because of the way client works, and also because of the way our understanding of how client works. I mean, from IDEO's perspective, I would have said client didn't really take their responsibility as majority of the reasons why this project failed. You wanna listen to more details about this project, right? Quite simple. The the client makes a flashlight. They are like contract manufacturer, [inaudible 00:26:06] term. They make flashlights, and they show their design to buyers from the American supermarkets. Yeah, I definitely have my own perspective on that, why if you expand project on bad experience. Client came to us with a big investment for they want IDEO to do some magic design, which bring them more money. That's their ultimate goal of working with IDEO. They come to us, ask us to design two products, amounting to product categories ways to mass market product. That basically means older product, it can be appreciated by [inaudible 00:27:22] average consumers. The other one is unique category, which is the product needs to have some, either unique shape, or behavior, functionality, features, no matter how unique it is. What defines the unique? That's the probably, actually, for this project, because it's not defined clearly what's uniques, what makes unique. Starting from the first step we made a mistake. Understand a client's perception of a uniqueness, it's really important about, I don't think we did a good job on that. Mainly I think 'cause of their buyer turned down the concepts, that's the reason they're angry about us. They thought they spend this money with us and didn't give them the result which satisfies the buyer. That's the striking point to this relationship gone really bad. That's the story. Really low. We never do that. We can't guarantee, 'cause it's innovation process. No one can guarantee [inaudible 00:34:54] success. Yes, it's appropriate. Time, it's tight. I mean, at the end of the day it's just flashlight, right? It's just about illumination, easy to use, easy to store. I think their expectation was too high, maybe. That's the reason. We don't believe it's a completely failure, 'cause it's completely failure, 'cause it hasn't been done. It's just concepts. We haven't done any refinements yet. They didn't get it. That's the big argument [inaudible 00:39:39]. That's also why we were in such a bad relationship, 'cause we can convince each other. That's means, `Okay then, we don't give you design and we don't get money back.` Yeah, even it's frustrating. People, I mean trying to share the responsibility across the whole team, instead of blaming, `Okay, you a bad designer.` Review the bias of senior designers. We do believe their opinion comes a bit more than young designers. Then relationship became really bad, because they refuse to take the concept, I mean [inaudible 00:38:04] they take one concept from mass product, which they like, for the unique they don't like all of the, and they ask of you to redesign. We don't wanna redesign, 'cause we don't have results and we don't have budget. I fixed a faked project, we design, I mean we lost money on the project, so we don't wanna redesign. We were trying to trying to convince them, `Okay, can you give us some more specific feedback, which feature you like? Which you feature you thin is bad? That we can refine those features and make that better design.` That's their argument. Our designer team is actually quite international. There's German designer, American designer and Chinese designer. We don't think it's a big deal. That's their talking point. Mainly I think 'cause of their buyer turned down the concepts, that's the reason they're angry about us. They thought they spend this money with us and didn't give them the result which satisfies the buyer. That's the striking point to this relationship gone really bad. That's the story. Definitely the stories of how American consumers use flashlights, and also a bigger box of samples, which Christine bought from the American. All kinds of flashlight designs. I mean, it's true, it's true, sometimes people don't really use flashlights. Some people use a certain [inaudible 00:36:02]. The design's kind of boring. Not too big variety. Last week, I just sent out a final, 'cause we finished our design, the mass product, we finished the design refinement. Right now it's just them. We're hoping they can give us outstanding, and [inaudible 00:40:13] that we can hand over the deliverables to them. If they don't give us to us any fee, we wouldn't give them the design. That's the end of the story. We send out notification of this statement, but make statement clear statement. `Okay, you pay amount, then I give you what we done. You don't pay, we don't give.` Usually was good, 'cause the client took IDEO as a shining star that they showed off respect, I guess, 'cause I wasn't involved in [inaudible 00:36:49]. That's my guess. Initial respect IDEO, they rely on IDEO, totally. I guess they were hoping IDEO can deliver something magic. We cut of a unique concept, therefore we actually revised our design fee for the design concept regeneration, that also design refinement, but for research, we didn't want to reduce the design fee, because we think the research is about finding out user behavior, and user needs. We didn't intend to divide the research result into two categories. That's the reason we wanna charge full price for the research fees. Our client, they have different understand of that. They said, `Okay, we cut off one category. We just shouldn't compress into half. Half for all the phases.` Really low. I mean, they actually wanna, once I do to current team, that sells performance, they wanna sign an extra contract with IDEO, like a loyalty contract, `If the product sells well, okay, you get benefit. If it doesn't sell well, okay, I only pay maybe half of the design fee to you.` Christine finished the research on then brought back a bunch of opportunity areas, the design principles for the designers to follow. The designers just generate some ideas based on what they learn from Christine's stories. We were hope to look at the concepts and pick one concept from each category and based on which we can find a design the make that final product design. That's basically how the process went. [inaudible 00:29:23] design, it didn't make any comments that it brought a design to their buyer. They showed the concepts to the buyers. Buyers, they [inaudible 00:29:35]. They need to convince buyers this designs are good, then buy the product from them. That's the way they make money. I think they got some bad comments from clients, and they just came back to us and say, `Okay, those designs bad. I want a design for the American market. This products must be designed the American designers, 'cause they can roll out with flashlights. You Chinese designers, you rarely use flashlights. How do you know how to design a nice flashlight?` After the turning point of the whole project, the relationship pretty comes pretty bad. We were trying hard to convince them those concepts are good concepts, they are promising, and that they are showing something new, and some unique feature. It doesn't have completely new, quite interesting if you're compared to some existing products, but clients he didn't get it. They come back to ideas saying, `Okay, you guys just copy some existing products, but we didn't.` Not yet. Actually, before this final official notification, I've sent out many emails. They never got back to us. Then, we send Christine. She was in charge of user research, consumer research in the America, talking to a bunch of American people. The market of our client is in the America, the one that's designed products for the American market. That's the reason we send Christine to it. They have an American talking to some American consumerist, try to understand their needs for the flashlight. They got to find a new opportunity areas. Also, send out a notification of project termination, `Okay, if I don't receive any feedback from you, response from you within 30 days, written document, stated in a legal document, if I don't receive any feedback within 30 days, we consider this project terminated.` Did do a good job of communication. We did a project debrief, basically laying out all the feelings we think finally land a project into a big failure. It's just about a lesson learned. Nobody really sulking, usually take responsibility of this. Personal relationship, it's definitely still good. We're still team. That's what I like about IDEO.   Yeah, we didn't have one dictator making one dictator making all the decisions.",

    "text": "We basically first step, generating new ideas, new shape, and the new behavior. Imagine how people, they use those dispensers to drop the ball into their water. We generate three ideas and we quickly finish the design for an inside mechanism and then we build the prototype. Not only the function, not prototype, but also build prototype which looks like real products and also works like real product. It's a really, really fast turnaround. I mean, designing class [inaudible 00:12:19] model making totally withstand two weeks. Really, I have a quick turn around project, and we really enjoy this quick generating ideas and making prototypes. This project, it's more like an idealization project. It's about IDEO designing something to give them inspiration. The design we did it, doesn't mean that's the design finally came to the market. It's more like we design something, give them inspiration. They may hire somebody else to finish the final design. They may change the shape, or behavior [inaudible 00:14:44]. It's a fun little project. Small. Part of the reason I really enjoy this is if the project is really long it's exhausting, which I don't like. I always wanna try something new, a quick turnaround. That, and new tasks. The clients is mature. They already hold a really strong position in the market to dare to try something new and fail. Those kind of clients that they got, definitely higher tolerance of fear, the risk. For example, some bigger client like PMG, or HP, I mean, they definitely, they are able to lose some money if the innovation project didn't turn out to be a good result. For some small client, especially a startup, the way I heard is the American company, or a Chinese company. Maybe especially Chinese company, because they don't really have much money and then they wanna see some short term, what's the word, short term, like benefit. It definitely have rely, rely tolerance of risk to something bad. Okay, for this kind of client, 'cause I recently just experience a really bad project experience, 'cause I was managing a project dealing with local clients. Working with IDEO mean a big investment for the [inaudible 00:17:48]. A small amount of money. It's like small project idea, before that it's a big project. It's like ever biggest project for them, before we work with some Italian and Hong Kong design firms, which they spend like US $10,000 to get like 10 designs. This time they can try to, they spend like US $100,000. They basically will get to [inaudible 00:18:26]. This big, big, huge investment for them. That's the reason they really have high expectations of IDEO. What's frustrating is the design would give them, they're not satisfied with, they're really frustrated with. They get pissed off. They said, `Oh, yeah. I spend so much money with which I can get maybe hundred design from local design firms.` Okay, for this kind of client, 'cause I recently just experience a really bad project experience, 'cause I was managing a project dealing with local clients. Working with IDEO mean a big investment for the [inaudible 00:17:48]. A small amount of money. It's like small project idea, before that it's a big project. It's like ever biggest project for them, before we work with some Italian and Hong Kong design firms, which they spend like US $10,000 to get like 10 designs.

That's the reason they really have high expectations of IDEO. What's frustrating is the design would give them, they're not satisfied with, they're really frustrated with. They get pissed off. They said, `Oh, yeah. I spend so much money with which I can get maybe hundred design from local design firms.` I mean, they really, really have lower tolerance. The reason they spend so much money, so that raise up their expectation a lot. They wanna do something better. I mean, the design we give them doesn't have to be a bad design, but from their perspective it doesn't really see the value. Maybe they still see the value, but they doesn't see the value as much as they spent. Just because, the really, really, high expectation. They don't want the design to be a failure in the market. They spend like $10,000, maybe they can tolerate to that. I mean, it depends on size and how mature the client is, and how much they willing to pay. It's quite limited. When you think about that, it's like two weeks projects are three people. Budget definitely limited. Also, it's a- It's more like a collective decision making process. Three of us, we are all engineers and just review design together and make collective decision. If it's like [inaudible 00:15:59] a question, it's hard to answer, because everybody's opinion in terms of [inaudible 00:16:04], it's like a subject of it's an engineering, solution, it's easier to make decision if it works, or not. You know what I mean? You get credits and credibility. Yeah, that's a really positive experience to me, 'cause that's kind of my really, really first project. Second, or third, that's the first, I think, started to experience this idea process, quick prototyping, quick idea generation. Generating ideas as quickly as possible, a whole new point of view, that whole new strong point of view [inaudible 00:13:21]. Come to conclusion as soon as possible, but don't get into your whole idea too deep, otherwise, you'll look at issue from different perspective. It's all about generating ideas quickly, but also still keep your mind open. Also making a prototype quickly to prove your idea. It's a totally new experience to me. Okay. Actually, we over delivered. I think, 'cause I mentioned it's ideation, inspiration, I didn't want a final design. They want something like to use a starting point to generate more ideas. We not only finished the designing of the shape, and the mechanism, we also did the final prototype which look just like real products. I mean, it's definitely over deliver. Oh, it's quite good. It was good. I mean the reason it's really simple, 'cause it's really, really beginning of my IDEO career, and for the other Chinese guy who are, and that's like a new experience for us to work together. Also, quite like a brand new experience working with the American engineer Dana, 'cause it's a new experience, it's a [inaudible 00:24:36] interesting by each other, and given the short period of time of this project, I just feel we didn't enough chance to offend a few members, or get offended back our team members. Imagine how people, they use those dispensers to drop the ball into their water. We generate three ideas and we quickly finish the design for an inside mechanism and then we build the prototype. Not only the function, not prototype, but also build prototype which looks like real products and also works like real product. It's a really, really fast turnaround. I mean, designing class [inaudible 00:12:19] model making totally withstand two weeks. Really, I have a quick turn around project, and we really enjoy this quick generating ideas and making prototypes. The design we did it, doesn't mean that's the design finally came to the market. It's more like we design something, give them inspiration. They may hire somebody else to finish the final design. They may change the shape, or behavior [inaudible 00:14:44]. It's a fun little project. The reason I feel excited about that is the outcome is good. Our internal client, I mean the guys in San Francisco office. They were really impressed by the work we did. I mean, for the client to like to work you did, of course you're happy.   Okay. As for staff week, we'll one hour to buy some similar products for inspiration, for reference, 'cause I'm never design something similar before. I have to see what's out on market, where I can get inspiration or starting point of inspiration ideation. We went out to buy some existing products. We just sit together, quick stretches, exchange ideas, get inspired from each other. Also do some web search, see if there are any similar application out there on the market. Just think about that, draw something, and refine your designs. It's quite intuitive, complex process.",

Basically it's because of the post production, it needs quite a lot post, but when the results come it's not what we imagined, the perfect result we expected. Different reasons. One is time and budget. I think the other reason is the job itself it's quite difficult in the production level, and other thing is the cooperation between the multi-national team because we have foreign director, the local [inaudible 00:15:12] production office, the client side, the agencies. Quite complicated. For this particular TV production lots of time spent on the research and also spent on the purchasing procedure which is quite odd for this brand.

The deadline and the timing for, preparation for the presentation, and production. The production value.Basically it's because of the post production, it needs quite a lot post, but when the results come it's not what we imagined, the perfect result we expected. I think the other reason is the job itself it's quite difficult in the production level, and other thing is the cooperation between the multi-national team because we have foreign director, the local [inaudible 00:15:12] production office, the client side, the agencies. Quite complicated. Different reasons. One is time and budget. ...everything. For instance, every time the company have to spend amount of money, like over the budget, they have this special department to kind of control the financial and to do the bidding thing. That's quite different comparing to other clients I'm working now.   One of the reason is the big company the whole procedure actually sometime you waste a lot of time on those things which are in fact not that important, but to just waste time, the back and forth, the paper work, the sometimes you gather everybody for a meeting, or you wait for the client side, or the internal side. I think some of the time are wasted and some of the time, like I said, on the research and the purchasing, No one knows what it's for. Sometime we spend to many time on the confirmation on the brief. So it spends even more time on the planning and account services side, comparing to when we think about ideas. Finally when we get the brief and we think of the idea. We only have like 10 days or one week. It's not like other client, maybe you can postpone a little bit on the launch day or air day, but here the launching of the car, usually because they have this car show, or press conference, blah blah blah. So, usually the deadlines fixed but when every step takes more time you just squeeze the production.",

We had to portray Gagganau as a premium brand, but at the same time they wanted to have a poetic and artistic touch to the ads. We had to do a set of print ads for mostly magazines, and we had to come up with ... It was like a trader's magazine that would go to retailers and stuff like that. For me, it was very [inaudible 00:07:28] because I had the freedom to actually write the poetry for this and to come up with visuals that would work together with the poetry, talk about the art of cooking and talk about, you know, yeah food and the goodness of food, but in a very professional way. It was pretty cool. It worked quite well. We got the pitch. Yeah. It was cool. I used this work to get accepted now in the young [inaudible 00:08:03] festival. I was very surprised, because it's a German company and it's a premium German company. We were expecting the brief to be very tight and to be very restrictive. But it actually once. It had actually been a pitch, and you usually have more freedom to do what you want. You still want to get the account. Yeah, it was quite a surprise. We had quite a lot of creative freedom, which was pretty good. More or less normal. Budget, for a pitch, it's usually low, but we had quite a lot of time to work on it, so it was fine. We didn't really see the client. I personally didn't meet with them. I think only the RECD met with the client. It was more the account servicing people meeting with them. We got feedback from them, but I didn't get to meet them. It was good. I was relatively new in the team. Yeah the relationship was good. They took in all of the ideas I had. I think I worked well with the ideas they had. I [inaudible 00:13:32] well.

It helped me a lot. One of the ads we did was, I wrote a little something about Pinot Noir. It was very inspired.   Again, it was okay. I think everyone was well aligned in these projects.

We weren't quite sure of what they wanted. We had a huge project to handle. It was back and forth all the time. We were getting some very vague feedback from them. We weren't able to develop based on those feedbacks. Communication was very bad. We worked on this project for I don't know maybe three months. When it was almost ready they pulled out the project. We never managed to actually hand it in. No, it was for three kinds of shampoo for repairing colored hair. We were asked to do two TV series. One for shampoo, one of conditioner. The brief asked us to target each color separately in the ad. We had red, black, and brown. That was the brief. Yeah, very ... They introduced something new in this brief. They wanted to have magical reality in the ad, but it wasn't very well explained what they meant by that. At the beginning when the brief came in we were having some good ideas as you usually do when a brief comes in. You usually go a bit crazy on it waiting for feedback. Then, every time we went back with something, they just completely changed everything, or asked us to change everything. By the end of it we had something completely manufactured. It was very bad. At that time very bad. The communication just wasn't there. Still good. We still worked well, yeah, considering that the morale was a bit low. Yeah. I mean account service, we have to understand they have a hard job trying to please the client and at the same time trying to deliver the blows in the soft way to us. It was a bit touch and go. First better communication between client and the agency, not just the creative department but the account servicing as well. We didn't get a clear brief. They should have gone back to client and made sure that the brief was very specific. Also, I don't know, maybe a bit of creative training with the client. We've been trying to do this for ages, trying to get them into a little creative training, creative workshop because I mean, they don't understand what the creative process is. For them it's a switch that you switch on and off and you come up with as many ideas as you want.  It was back and forth all the time. We were getting some very vague feedback from them.

I think it wasn't just a problem with that brief. There was problems before. In that particular brief, the communication just wasn't there. The feedback we were getting was not specific enough. They weren't happy. We weren't happy. It wasn't working very well. Same I think. Yeah, I think planning wasn't really understanding what the client wanted as well, so it wasn't getting well translated to us.   First better communication between client and the agency, not just the creative department but the account servicing as well. We didn't get a clear brief. They should have gone back to client and made sure that the brief was very specific.",

No inspiration. No, they make a phone call and then, `I need blah, blah, blah. I need that after one hour.` So how can you get like ... An hour. We've got some, not just a few. We still tried to be professional. On our side, it's very bad. On the client's side, I think they don't care. They don't care about our feeling. Mm-hmm (affirmative). They are not nice, rude to us, and then, they didn't respect us as a human being, not a creative. Is impolite sometimes when we talk and then, maybe he look but ... maybe we represented story part, he will, something like that. Something. The gesture not nice, I mean. And then, maybe top form and then, not good. Yeah, something like that. It make you feel bad. Yeah, really impolite. Yeah. That is, for me, I think this is not good. Yeah, the feeling. You say something and then, they are not looking at you. So, this is me and then, they are not looking at you and then, reading magazine, and then, when he saw something and then, he's just like that. Then, `I think this is not nice. I don't need that. Do it again.` But I'm still sitting there. Yeah. Please work with me, something like that. That is the company at the table that we cannot say no. At that time, it's really tough. And usually, they have unreasonable timing and unreasonable comments. Zero. Very tight.   With planning, no planning. No planning people because no plan.",

    "text": "Yeah, I think the last one [inaudible 00:16:09] is, I think what was really good about this project was that it was ... it ran out of the health practice, but none of us actually, as a team members, had been exposed to any health practice projects before, so I think that was a really good thing because we had three coaches, and in the [inaudible 00:16:30] three coaches, I was like, `Oh guys, yeah right. What is this gonna be like?` But what it turned out to be was that two people, because it was health practice, but then partly transformation. Are you familiar with transformation? It's basically looking at companies and seeing how they ... it's a bit like change management, but also helping them implement this. For example, now with this project, we actually had ... I think we went okay to 70% in the health practice and 30% in transformations. We had one coach from health, and one from transformation, plus then the BD person to scope the project. I think another thing was that our project manager was very transparent. Hands on, on the one way, kept away everything that was ... that could've distracted the team. She was really building this transparent wall between us and the client, and at the same time, it was transparent, so we actually knew what was going on. I think what was also really adding to this was he was very much reflecting on his own thoughts, and his own feelings towards the project. Alex, who was the third guy, he actually said at some point, `[inaudible 00:18:31] is so gay.` Because he's so reflective, and I mean, he's from Spain, so he's like machismo. He was like, `This is so gay.` But that really helped because Hans was telling us, `You know what, guys? I'm not feeling good about this, and I'm getting really nervous.` Obviously, we were a very mature team, if you tell not that mature people, like very junior people that you are very nervous, I mean, it's sort of like the nervousness spills and it doesn't do any good. But with our team, it was like, we just knew we could pull it off. In that sense, then sharing these feelings was actually really helpful 'cause then some of us could say, `Hans, not at all. We as a team have a really good feeling.` He'd go like, `Really?` And then we would talk about it, so we had multilayered conversations about the actual work, about logistics, about stuff that was going on. About how we analyze the client, which is always helpful. Like what is the client's position? Who's our point of contact? Really getting a good idea of how they are internally situated, like their politics. Obviously, we were a very mature team, if you tell not that mature people, like very junior people that you are very nervous, I mean, it's sort of like the nervousness spills and it doesn't do any good. But with our team, it was like, we just knew we could pull it off. In that sense, then sharing these feelings was actually really helpful 'cause then some of us could say, `Hans, not at all. We as a team have a really good feeling.` He'd go like, `Really?` And then we would talk about it, so we had multilayered conversations about the actual work, about logistics, about stuff that was going on. About how we analyze the client, which is always helpful. Like what is the client's position? Who's our point of contact? Really getting a good idea of how they are internally situated, like their politics They really were concepts in the sense of, `Okay, tomorrow your lunches are banned. The day after tomorrow your samples are banned, but hang on, we got some stuff for you here.` However, the client was like, `Yeah, I really like that stuff, but my boss, she's not gonna like that.` They were like, `You know, we need a bag.` That was then the whole discussion with the bag versus scenarios about creating value added services for a sales rep. For example, one idea we had was the sales rep finding out information about diabetes, prediabetes, like where can you buy fresh groceries for a cheap price? Where's a gym that has the best membership and whatever? Free membership with a free pair of trainers, or I don't know what. But to then have the sales rep being like the agent to go out, collect all this information and create a webpage for the doctors. That was one of the ideas. I mean, client loved it. Said like, `Yeah, but my boss, she wants a bag.` We were like, `Okay.` In the end, I mean, that was like ... I think the success of the project was that we all talked about it. It wasn't just decided by the PM going, `Okay, we need a designer, you design a bag.` Obviously, we were a very mature team, if you tell not that mature people, like very junior people that you are very nervous, I mean, it's sort of like the nervousness spills and it doesn't do any good. But with our team, it was like, we just knew we could pull it off. What is at risk for him if we don't give him the bag, you know? To sort of understand what's going on on their side, and then the third layer, to say, okay how are we all feeling about this? Obviously, the client didn't take part in that bit, but it really was about the team. Yeah, so we finished the project and yeah, now they're thinking about implementing in, and internally they shared it with their top guy. And so, it's really ... Yeah, I think it was a very successful project. There are even numbers that, for sales reps, for one week, they don't call in the doctor, the rate drops off prescriptions. There really is part to it, however, we're now in a world where they can't give any presents anymore. They can't take doctors golfing, or [inaudible 00:21:24]. I don't know what. Now it's all reduced to samples, like drug samples, and pens, sticky, like sticky post its. It's becoming a bit ridiculous because the sales reps, they walk into the door, they first have their schmoozing chat with the ... with Sue who sits at the reception and hands the first token to buy access to the room in the back, and the treatment rooms. What are the areas that you can actually, within this highly restricted pharma code, and highly restricted, or this highly volatile situation, how can you actually find out new ways of bringing value? We came up with a couple of ideas in terms of actually supporting the doctors, realized some doctors just had really huge egos, and they really needed sales reps to help them. I mean, there are some weird dynamics going on, especially with older doctors, and also with very young doctors that are taught in med school stay away from the sales reps. They all want to influence you. You have very many different audiences. Yeah, so we came up with a couple of concepts that were actually quite far out. Sometimes they get to see the doctors, and usually doctors were like, `You know what? Good sales reps are people who actually offer a service. But the ones that just shout at me like, 'Aspirin, doctor. Buy aspirin. Prescribe aspirin.', they're just not any use.` The idea was, okay ... And the reps also do lunches. What's happening now is that lunches get banned, sales reps get banned and the next thing will be samples will be banned, and what are you gonna do then? Novo Nordisk is a Danish company for insulin, an insulin bio farm manufacturer, and they were like, `You know what? We entered the US market, we just hired another 700 salespeople, so we don't want to get rid of them right away, so let's see what we can do.` We went out to understand what is the sales interaction like, and so, what are the opportunity spaces? What was really helpful was that, especially, the guy from the health practice, he was so aware that none of us had a health background, so he would tell the project manager, don't worry about my billing wage, I do the regular check ins for as the coaching, which basically would be like an hour a week or something, or sometimes two hours a week. But then he would say, `You know what? If you have any question about health, I'm happy to stay on longer.` I mean, if we had some sessions where we would stay for four hours and we would just pick his brain and go, `Okay, tell us about it. How does it work? What is the [inaudible 00:17:43]? What is the history of insulin? What are the different insulin pens?` Just like questions like this, 'cause none of us had a clue about that. And so, that was really helpful.   But it was more like, `Okay guys, what do you feel? What is the bag standing for? What is it resembling?` At some point, I mean, we could've all killed him because of the bag, because we're all like, `Yes, we need the bag.` [inaudible 00:24:46] anymore. But looking back, I think it was just really good 'cause it felt like we were, despite of having different years at IDO, despite of being ... just having different experiences and life experiences, but it really felt like we were all sitting at a table and we were all valued with our opinion. I think that was, for example, for me, what really make this also a successful project. I think another thing was that our project manager was very transparent. Hands on, on the one way, kept away everything that was ... that could've distracted the team. She was really building this transparent wall between us and the client, and at the same time, it was transparent, so we actually knew what was going on.

    "text": "I think it was also a medium one. It was definitely not one of the huge, big projects. It was also in terms of the positioning of the project was more a strategic one for IDEO as well because it was actually the first project we did looking at the same schools. It was about an area that I hope to grow into more. On the client side we had one key contact. He handed it, basically, over because he got promoted in the middle of it to another guy. There were two but their core team consisted of four people. It's a health practice and it's so restricted so I think it was high. With everything we suggested it was like, `No you can do this. No you can't do that.`, which wasn't so much the client, but more the industry we are working in. I would say between mid and high. At the end of the day, I think the inspiration came from sitting down and really allowing us the time and the space to talk through things. We also had collaborative workshops where we asked sales people from the client company to actually come and join us and do a prototyping workshop. Those were helpful because it showed us, again, how difficult it was to design anything in that space. The guy who was our key contact, he was even too busy to pick up the phone. We had a really hard time getting in touch with him. Then it felt like the more contact we actually did have, the more times he came over and we presented stuff, as the Danish are very straightforward, very honest, blatantly honest, also very clear about what he wanted- I think there were ... it was like a typical guy's dynamics. I was the only girl on the team. Two guys and then Scot, the graphic designer, joined us so it was four of us. Then our ID person joined, this other guy. The coaches were ... No, there's, our BD, she's female but it was a really, sort of, buddy relationship with the team. There was a lot of joking. There was a lot of sharing but then there were also really intense moments where, I mean, we were all out in the field. We're connecting on Skype. We meant to do a download but then we just said, you know what, I'm actually just so exhausted about things. Thanks to Hunts being so gay about it, although he's just not. I think that just made the relationship very rich. It wasn't a superficial project. Also, I think, because all of a sudden we realized how many people have diabetes. How many lives have been touched with diabetes. How all of a sudden we hear stories about how, especially older doctors, never change their treatment since they went to med school 20 years or 30 years ago. You suddenly realize that it is an epidemic that is spreading especially in the U.S. I think that was something where it was also quite hard for us to go through emotionally and see all this and have doctors that tell us, `Yeah, and I tell my patients to workout and to do more exercise.` Then you see all their staff members that are barrels. You just think they will be your next patient. I think, first of all, it was a lot about understanding. We went out and did ride alongs with [inaudible 00:06:17] reps. We went to, all three of us which is quite rare, went to different locations on our own. Usually people don't go out on their own for HF. Usually always two people. That was really exhausting but at the same time allowed us to get some insights, I think, that were more intimate in a way because it was just a one on one conversation. Like with you now and not with a team of three where you're a bit like, okay, should I say this or not? There was a lot of sharing but then there were also really intense moments where, I mean, we were all out in the field. We're connecting on Skype. We meant to do a download but then we just said, you know what, I'm actually just so exhausted about things. Thanks to Hunts being so gay about it, although he's just not. I think that just made the relationship very rich. It wasn't a superficial project   No, because it was positioned so strategically actually on the health practice have given us permission to not work on the margins, to actually sort of just do what we had to do. For example, I was supposed to be pulled off that project after the human factors phase was over, but, I mean, I said I really wanted to learn. I really wanted to have a chance to finally be on a project a bit longer. Once I talked with them it was like, you know what, actually it does make sense to expose you more to this because hopefully we're going to get more projects like this. In the end the health practice said well, don't worry about margins and that was quite special. That also made life so much easier. A lot of the inspiration, I think, was actually coming from being with really cool people and sitting down, talking, and then having some time to yourself going through things. Then looking at things again and going like, oh you know what, that really reminds me of this and this. Check out this web page and sending each other YouTube clips, web pages, interesting stuff.",

    "text": "So, I think that was a big frustration for myself, finding myself like with a very junior team that I was leading here, having a project manager that was in a different location, and then having also, just being overwhelmed a lot by it. And also since we don't really have human factor support here, it really feels, I'm the most- like with Joan out, on her rotation, we're really like the most senior HF people here and I mean, we're like high 2, whatever that means. And fortunately we had some more HF sketched into the project for the synthesis part and that was really helpful, because otherwise it would have been really painful. But with that project, was a lot about people's competencies, and how some people were like, `Yeah, we can pull it off.` It was a lot about showing office pride, I found. It takes time, and also [inaudible 00:04:41] wasn't quite like ... I think everybody had a hard time with that project, and there were so many expectations, fortunately it developed well, we have a strong relationship with TCL now, but it was hard in that way. But again, because the money here has more value, so people who were put on the team were put there to be coached, and that is always an issue. You can't have an aggressive schedule and then put people on that need coaching. You want people who can do the job Oh, on the client's side, well, there's the top guy, but he's such a- I mean that's another thing. Chinese companies, the decision makers are not as obvious, so you could almost say there was a whole bunch of them. But like the top guy, I think he made most of the decisions for that one. Um, I think the budget was ... because, again, the project amount was just of so much more value here, so the budget was not that much for that kind of project, but because it just lasts longer, so, it felt like well budgeted. I think my relationship was good because I speak Chinese, and I was able to sort of bond with them quite well. I felt that in general, this whole language thing is just such a divide, and people are dependent on the translator and Vivian. I mean obviously the relationship is there, otherwise we wouldn't have future work, but ... It didn't feel like, `Hey we're in the room together to create something new.` It was more like, `Hey you, you're in our space now. Do something. Increase our sales, for example. Do something beautiful.` And it maybe didn't feel like they wanted to be engaged. For example the kitchen project I was on, people were actually more open to a creative process, but with them, no. But that's also maybe because, you know I grew up without TV, I never owned a TV. I have a TV in my apartment because my landlord doesn't want to move it out of my apartment, so, it was like a project where I was totally lacking a connection to it. So there was many more layers put on top of that project than just designing a TV ad [inaudible 00:03:50]. At the same time, it was my first project that I did here in Shanghai after moving here. It just felt that- actually, that's not true. There was an HF rotator here, but she's never coached a project. You have to have coaching experience in order to know what is helpful to those guys that are stuck in a room and dream about that project. Five? The core team and then obviously it gets then handed over to different phases, and then people more or less. I think another issue was too many undefined roles. I think time was, it was almost a bit too much time there, but not enough support. That was Redux, the first TV that signed for them. I felt that that was like a typical thing what happens in the Shanghai office, with on the one hand having project managers sitting in Palo Alto, the team being here. It was the first project that was running out of the office as big as it was, and also with lots of time and research. And I think the other problem was that people were just thinking, `Of course we can do it.` And nobody was thinking, `Yes, with a junior team you can do it in other locations where you have senior coaches that check in, see how it's going, and then give you feedback and have a project manager on board.` But with that project, was a lot about people's competencies, and how some people were like, `Yeah, we can pull it off.` It was a lot about showing office pride, I found.   So it really felt like not being supported, and at the same time it felt like expectations were high, it felt like various people breathing down our necks, coming back from an observation. `So what are the top insights?` And you're like, `Whoa, whoa, whoa, hang on, let me ...` No, not that many. I was- but it just felt like, there was a project manager, and there were the three location, no, it was one of them- the other two people were running the location, BD, yeah, that was for example, a project where I didn't feel that I was involved in the decision making process. I was giving my point of view, but I didn't feel like the other project where I felt it was very successful. I think my relationship was good because I speak Chinese, and I was able to sort of bond with them quite well. I felt that in general, this whole language thing is just such a divide, and people are dependent on the translator and Vivian. It didn't feel like, `Hey we're in the room together to create something new.` It was more like, `Hey you, you're in our space now. Do something. Increase our sales, for example. Do something beautiful.` And it maybe didn't feel like they wanted to be engaged. For example the kitchen project I was on, people were actually more open to a creative process, but with them, no. But we're not people who have seen 1,000 projects and actually look at them and say, `Hey guys you need to change A, B and C and then you're done` sort of thing. We look at it and we're like, Okay that's another three days work.` Obviously we're in a very different level which is normal, because we're not in our forties or anything, in our late thirties, but it sounds like that was lacking. It was more about this project is a good chance to get to know what's going on in people's homes, so Christine and me were more like excited about, `Hey, we're learning so much about what people put in their living room versus their bedroom, and the bathroom, and whatsoever.` So it was really more like a in-depth study of people's homes. But it didn't really feel like, like for me it wasn't inspirational.",

    "text": "Here's another thing, as an industrial designer, probably for some other industrial designers. So industrial designers have some problem in idea maybe, it's complex problem, industry and, you know, the whole market, and demand goes in a pendulum, in a direction that's a reason why. Internally, we spend too much effort on the [inaudible 00:13:48] and initial work. Which is, a strange idea. Since we spend too much effort on the initial research step, we have only two weeks to actually sit down and start to bring your own perspectives and creativity. But this project, Samsung TV project, we really shortened down the whole initial step, and we spent enough time for designing actual project. Do you want to see that? There is certain project which it can be scared by that initial step. So, I think then what left is personal creativity based on our current idea background. Collaborative [inaudible 00:17:30]. Probably medium-high, not really high because TV, you know, designing TV is [inaudible 00:18:20] someone. And, they really pushed us to have new, innovative idea, but there's not really core technology or the latest innovations there. There's not technology, we can't really innovate, yeah.   And then because Samsung is a very hierarchical place, so like, higher-up guy like that and then there's some decision-maker and if decision-maker decide that than it's pretty straightforward we can go there. Luckily, the decision-maker from our side liked our ideas so it really went well. We had more than ten years relationship with Samsung guys, so it was really efficient to work together because while we don't need to spend time to get to know each other and we don't need to spend lots of time to persuading, we don't need to transparent what this whole process are, so we just basically trust we can specially develop our own perspectives and then they'll [inaudible 00:22:01]. So, the super senior guy, you know one of ones the list, he was director, and there was another guy, sort of like PNY and the senior designer, and there was a tech support and beauty support. Actually I was [inaudible 00:23:04] and I worked with a lot of junior, very junior interns, so we worked that way. So since Mike was, really super senior, so I didn't really, I don't think we very collaboratingly worked together, except that we worked very well collaboratively, but he was more like a come in once a week or twice a month and then checking this and that, so yeah, that was it. So, the super senior guy, you know one of ones the list, he was director, and there was another guy, sort of like PNY and the senior designer, and there was a tech support and beauty support. Which is, a strange idea. Since we spend too much effort on the initial research step, we have only two weeks to actually sit down and start to bring your own perspectives and creativity.

Luckily, the decision-maker from our side liked our ideas so it really went well. That might be another reason why it worked pretty exceptionally well. Because like, some project each team is very uncertain of what to do. Sometimes clients came to us even what the problem is, even they don't know even what the problem is. And they very, very vague, you know, situation. Then we need real CS resource from someone there. Also, some sort of new offering, or new something for huge customer, and if it's really unknown stuff, then I think this whole process is really very awful.",

I mean, it went very well in the end, it did have a really nice final, it was [inaudible 00:31:15] program, and then overall I don't think unsuccessful project at all, I think it was very successful project. Simple product but it was like Phase 0, Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3. So it was really long, six months or seven months this project, and we spent almost two months to research in total organization of HP rather than get to the real customer.  So, I think only that first phase was very, unsuccessful. Yeah. Because it was very hard to understand that whole weird politics side and then messing up the natural design. I don't think we figured it out very well. So how can we make these things, how can we make expensive one look more expensive, and how can we make cheaper one look more cheaper? But they're sharing qualities, thinking about the core technology, it's the same! I mean, the thing is, really the customer service is not really customer don't even [inaudible 00:32:53], it's more about distractions in your market strategy. So, we spend like one or two months, on just in this whole internal situation, in order to get to the customer. Actually, I don't think that anyone in HP can figure that out as well, because it is not something make it better or something make it right, it's all about it's touchpoint was just wrong. Yeah, so that part was very unsuccessful and unpleasant. Make it look like, just like good looking or like a market message or brand, can help them to be or look like [inaudible 00:35:43] or something like that. So, I don't know how other guys can deal with that, unless involved in the strategy side.

I mean, the thing is, really the customer service is not really customer don't even [inaudible 00:32:53], it's more about distractions in your market strategy. So, we spend like one or two months, on just in this whole internal situation, in order to get to the customer. So, I think only that first phase was very, unsuccessful. Yeah. Because it was very hard to understand that whole weird politics side and then messing up the natural design. I don't think we figured it out very well. Because HP is big company, and they make tons of product, and internally they've got lots of political and stuff going on. And imagine you have printer engine, you have one single mechanical inside, but you have different cosmetic on there, and then you just add different gimmicks and then you sell all different prices. And internal market strategy. So, we give them pretty much right answer, but I don't think politically its good thing to do. But, if you had to say oh it's not right thing to do then, well you can do it that way, but it's not really make the world prettier.   So, let's say you're working at [inaudible 00:35:19]. So, [inaudible 00:35:19] was to be well-being company. But when you know this tool is not working at all, but you need to package it.",

And I was brought in, mainly to try and rescue because the team had kind of lost faith, it being one of these long nightmare projects, I can't even remember what the brief was, oh to come up with two forty-million-pound-generating TV concepts. We had a project manager we brought in from outside, and we had- No, it was mainly because we didn't have anyone internally that had any experience of generating TV concepts. A lot of the reasons were that, she as a Project Manager wasn't supported, in terms of knowing exactly how things work in terms of, resourcing how hard you have to put your foot down to get the team that you want and the resources that you need, and she was also very, she was struggling to learn the IDEO process and talk to the client in IDEO language, whilst also learning how to navigate IDEO as an organization, as well as navigating the client as an organization A lot of the reasons were that, she as a Project Manager wasn't supported, in terms of knowing exactly how things work in terms of, resourcing how hard you have to put your foot down to get the team that you want and the resources that you need, and she was also very, she was struggling to learn the IDEO process and talk to the client in IDEO language, whilst also learning how to navigate IDEO as an organization, as well as navigating the client as an organization. It didn't really come together, and I don't even know how we actually finished it, I think we shared them with the internal team, which in the end we didn't actually share them with the CEOs like we were supposed to.

It didn't really come together, and I don't even know how we actually finished it, I think we shared them with the internal team, which in the end we didn't actually share them with the CEOs like we were supposed to. The interesting thing there was someone internally had his own hidden agenda, that wasn't revealed until a lot later on. Client, yeah. So basically he patented some technology. The interesting thing was, we had another project for Bertelsmann running simultaneously looking at CRM systems, managing customer relationships, and that team had the stronger team ... the other team was slightly, I kept ended up coming to help, was slightly behind. The other team was almost setting the bar higher than the, for the client differently, and not all talking to the other team, so there were two, generally we had three teams, but we were very cautious, I think we learned from Bertelsmann that you've got to make sure you're delivering at the same level to the same client at the same time, because if one of you is delivering at this level and one of you is delivering at this level, it's really hard to justify that to the client, whereas if you just delivered the same kind of format, it makes a lot more sense. So I was brought in to help with the formative research, which, once we've got some ideas, taking them out and showing them to people, trying to get the teams to build the ideas, so to get consumers to help us build the ideas, refine them, and kind of try and make them as human [inaudible 00:05:00] desirable as possible. We had these concepts for something six propositions, so I kind of came in and was like, “Right guys, we've got to finish the prototyping,” and they were like, “The client doesn't like any of the ideas.” So there's kind of this whole tension where we needed to move forward, and the client, you know, “I don't like any of the ideas because I don't understand them, and I don't have the time to try and understand them.` But the interesting similarities with this project here is having that change of team internal, kind of IDEO team members in the middle, also a lot of information was lost, so that made it even harder to then try pull things together, because I came in and I was like, `What's this project about?` And they pulled the other person off, so that had kind of created really nasty friction ... I don't know what to say now. the client's hidden agenda  and also the lead client who was meant to be our point of contact wasn't particularly good at corralling the internal team or media creators, they all thought they were amazing, round to make one decision. I think it's a lot harder with newer clients, if we can get through that stage with clients than it tends to kind of develop into more efficient relationships, that's the one thing that can be a problem. A lot of it comes down to how the project is scoped. It's like we've been doing in London is almost having a team of people, that as you've got the team doing the project you have a second team of people making sense of what it means to the client, and helping facilitate the internal, having conversations, someone with IDEO having conversations with all the internal stakeholders about what they think is the answer, and then helping create almost a way in, making sure that when the ideas come up, we've almost got a process for crafting that feedback, and [inaudible 00:09:58] that feedback. It can, but it's a lot of resources. The interesting thing in China it seems, it's a lot harder to justify the size of the budgets for those kinds of projects, especially when you are working with what the flashlight was, a kind of local Chinese, more manufacturer, they're making flashlights, they're not a multi-million pound media company with money to invest. The projects where we've done that looking in, making sense, you can do that really easy with a big company, because you justify that they're really hard to understand. The interesting thing, when I was interviewing people and trying to work out what was the right curriculum for the project leadership program, virtually everyone that was Chinese that I spoke to all said the most important thing was knowing how to introduce yourself to people, and build rapport and build credibility with the client, so that they see you at the right level. That's one thing that we've got wrong on some of the projects we've done out here with Chinese clients is, certain team members were introduced, and they're not seen as [inaudible 00:14:19], they actually are, or their role is not as explained, and then they're perceived as less credibility than actually they deserve. And then it happens across offices, because our guys think in Chinese, when they're put onto an American, they do have English skills, but they're not able to articulate themselves quite so concisely, so people just assume that they're not as intelligent or not as capable of doing the job, which actually it's not the case. You put them in front of a Chinese client and they talk in Chinese, you know that they're talking a lot better than any of us could, even with an interpreter. It was awhile ago so I don't actually remember how much money it was, but it was a big hefty budget, I think they were like a million pound, million euro programs each. I think they were like 16 weeks, the kind of, from opportunity-area scoping and trying to find potential opportunity areas, through to actually prototyping some rough solutions. The interesting thing was, considering the scale, the client didn't react as badly as they could have done, but I think a lot of that was because they knew that they had thrown so many spanners in the works, and luckily the other project was hugely successful and they've decided to implement double, we offered I think two or three solutions, and they were going to choose one to take forward, and I think they're taking two forward. That kind of helped balance all the not-so-nice- stuff in the other project. The interesting thing, when I was interviewing people and trying to work out what was the right curriculum for the project leadership program, virtually everyone that was Chinese that I spoke to all said the most important thing was knowing how to introduce yourself to people, and build rapport and build credibility with the client, so that they see you at the right level.

It became really unhidden towards the end. The interesting thing was, we had another project for Bertelsmann running simultaneously looking at CRM systems, managing customer relationships, and that team had the stronger team ... the other team was slightly, I kept ended up coming to help, was slightly behind. The other team was almost setting the bar higher than the, for the client differently, and not all talking to the other team, so there were two, generally we had three teams, but we were very cautious, I think we learned from Bertelsmann that you've got to make sure you're delivering at the same level to the same client at the same time, because if one of you is delivering at this level and one of you is delivering at this level, it's really hard to justify that to the client, whereas if you just delivered the same kind of format, it makes a lot more sense. But the interesting similarities with this project here is having that change of team internal, kind of IDO team members in the middle, also a lot of information was lost, so that made it even harder to then try pull things together, because I came in and I was like, `What's this project about?` And they pulled the other person off, so that had kind of created really nasty friction ... I don't know what to say now. In other countries, just from what I've seen with the projects that have been going on here, in the UK it seems a lot easier for people regardless of actually who they are to actually get in to the people they need to speak to. Whereas in China it seems, you've got to really justify who this person is before they're allowed to speak to that person, not just being from IDO is enough, they've got to be the right person from within IDO. I think Shanghai is still trying to work out how that can happen, with the limited resources we have. It was an experiment that didn't work. A lot of the reasons were that, she as a Project Manager wasn't supported, in terms of knowing exactly how things work in terms of, resourcing how hard you have to put your foot down to get the team that you want and the resources that you need, and she was also very, she was struggling to learn the IDO process and talk to the client in IDO language, whilst also learning how to navigate IDO as an organization, as well as navigating the client as an organization. It didn't really come together, and I don't even know how we actually finished it, I think we shared them with the internal team, which in the end we didn't actually share them with the CEOs like we were supposed to. The interesting thing there was someone internally had his own hidden agenda, that wasn't revealed until a lot later on. Also, anyone in a team can actually do it with the smaller projects, but unless someone kind of takes it as a role, “I am going to take responsibility for this,” I have seen it kind of get forgotten and then cause things to hiccup. It's not the only thing that cause [inaudible 00:11:28]. I think, for me it's made me realize that, that's one of the hardest things we often come up with is when the client comes to us with a problem, and a very specific design challenge, but actually the reason they've come to us is because they can't work out how to come up with the right answer themselves, because they don't know what they want. And when they've come with such an explicit design challenge, sometimes it can slip by that they don't know what they want, and they might have asked for something that actually isn't right for them, and isn't actually what they want.   We had these concepts for something six propositions, so I kind of came in and was like, “Right guys, we've got to finish the prototyping,” and they were like, “The client doesn't like any of the ideas.” So there's kind of this whole tension where we needed to move forward, and the client, you know, “I don't like any of the ideas because I don't understand them, and I don't have the time to try and understand them.` I think because of that, the change of team members, the fact that we did have this external contractor, and the client's hidden agenda, and also the lead client who was meant to be our point of contact wasn't particularly good at corralling the internal team I don't think we did the best to give him the tools to actually manage that, because I think he came across as very capable, so we just assumed that he could get the right kind of feedback from his guys. And I think with the flashlight it's the same, we didn't think about how showing them the ideas and getting them to grab some feedback, how difficult that could be, hadn't thought kind of far enough-",

    "text": "There was a client team of six or seven. And so it was ... they tried to get questions slightly by consensus. So it was ... [inaudible 00:00:33] was meant to be one [inaudible 00:00:35]. It was kind of again a very tiered organization so we had to get the buy-in from the core team of seven people what ideas we would take forward to show to the CEOs. And so we were showing things to two CEOs, two different divisions, and then that ... and let the executive board and that executive board was going to decide which one they took forward. And so because of that it was ... we weren't allowed to show anything to the board. Some of the people that knew were close to the board. So we weren't allowed to talk to the board but our core team, once we got them to agree, then had to ... they had people they wanted to convince things to and then they passed those messages on to the people around the board. And the board only ever saw the final [inaudible 00:01:49]. So even though we were trying to design for these kind of ... to get the buy-in, we had to get the people around these people that almost protected to try and make the decision, which was slightly strong. So once these guys were getting to know the board where the final ideals were going to, their ideas, and they were helping bridge that link between our core team we were working with and the core with an extra pair of eyes into this pen of executive board and CEOs that were actually going to make the final decisions. So there were, on the IDEO side there was, I think, two people, three people that were having regular reviews, critiquing what the project team was doing. There was also a business factors person who was very much had a strong opinion of what was right. So I suppose you could almost call him a decision maker. And he was really flying the 'look we can't suggest that to them because it's never going to make them any money.' He was slightly closed to coming up with creative new ways of making money but it was more of a 'that's not going to make money.' And then we also brought in a third decision maker towards the end to help push it forward. So one, two ... four, five key decisions makers in a team of eight. Well there was the project manager. Well it kind of changed. There was the project manager, and there was a team of one or two ... in the project team there was the project manager and a business factors person. And then outside the ... there was people meant to be doing the sense making but that wasn't to feed into the actual project being delivered. It was always like a third piece of work that was actually completely separate. So once they were learning things, none of the learnings were really being considered what was the right way it was more of us helping them write a pipeline of innovation and then set up for the global company rather than the two separate companies that we were working with.   So I suppose you could almost call him a decision maker. And he was really flying the 'look we can't suggest that to them because it's never going to make them any money.' He was slightly closed to coming up with creative new ways of making money but it was more of a 'that's not going to make money.'",

    "text": "But, yeah, they were really keen for innovation. They were still quite on their ... what is possible. So, I think it was really hard to balance with this budget because the client only wanted to consider the amount of money, and I think having that kind of ... Each of these ideas has got to make forty million pounds profit. And the forty million pounds is because they own the Pop Idol franchise model. And that's what each series of Pop Idol makes. So, they wanted the next Pop Idol, basically, is what we've been asked to deliver. And not having that kind of ... Not getting support back from the client on why they weren't willing to consider it. And because of the time it was taking to get these concepts ready, the client couldn't' agree on which ones they wanted to take forward, that made it really hard to then help the clients understand. So, when I came on to do that kind of testing ... Though I hate the word testing because it sounds so quantitative ... Just kind of try to build the desirability case around the concepts. The client was still struggling with the decision of how they got the right ideas going forward. So, it was very hard. I didn't feel ... I came on ... Well, and what I was doing wasn't being articulated the right way, because there was so many other problems at that stage going on. Even though that's why they came to us. They were still again only focused on the numbers on the bottom of the business case than what they were. No, I think that was another one of the problems. It was kind of like come up with a consumer ... I think it was a consumer benefiting ... So, the whole thing was rather than coming up with how can this make money, it was meant to be based on consumer need, or consumer insight. With the idea that that would make things more- Because it's so based on kind of the trend or tipping points. So, I think it was just a really difficult process. Meg London, and I think everyone that touched the project ... A lot more cautious of how projects are [inaudible 00:06:48]. And everyone is now a lot more actively looking at the proposals before they go out the door, so that it doesn't happen again. Because of how we were delivering, we weren't delivering just a business case. We were spending more time on more what the interaction would be like for a consumer than they would ever consider. Kinda more what they needed. I think it's actually not what they wanted, sorry, it's not what they needed. It's what they thought they needed. I think well ... One person had been pulled off because people didn't think she was capable, and I got pulled in with a team of two other people to kinda help pull it all together. It was one of these kind of slightly- But with super amounts of hours and also trying to get the team to do some social stuff. So, just like taking the team out to really expensive restaurants for lunch. Just to try and ... And she did a great job of getting the team to bond, but the bond was bitching about how shit the project was; which kind of didn't really help. So, what she did ... It was very much like, `We're the crusaders, and we're driving through this pain, and we're gonna get to the end, and we can do it` kind of comradery. But the core team of three people that had been on since the beginning really really struggled to kinda stay motivated; including the project manager, and they were just looking for the end. And they completely detached themselves from everything else that was going on, I think, just to protect themselves. But also because everyone was good friends, and the consultants who brought in also people that were personal friends of senior people within the London office. It was a really bizarre kind of ... It felt you kinda just had to be careful what you're saying and who you're saying to, you couldn't just kind of let off steam and then get back in. You felt like you had to be careful. I think also because it felt like the rest of the office been kept out in the dark, and trying to make out to the rest of the office that everything was going smoothly. The other team that was working for the same client was getting all this praise about how great their project was at the same time, which kind of was like rubbing salt into an open wound. So, we then had a big ... everyone that had touched it in any shape or form had meetings with leadership, and we had kind of a big internal looking in on why it had gone wrong. And so, that's kinda had a huge influence on trying to change how we run projects. It's changed how we scope and who's involved in scoping. And it's had some changes on just kind of how people are brought in and how projects [inaudible 00:16:45] about, which I think is good. It's like `Yeah, we brought this many people in.` And it was done in a really bad way. It was like, `Oh, we're taking this person off. We're not gonna tell any one why we've taken this person off, or why this person is now sitting in the office not working on his project.` No one in the rest of the company was told; like the rest of the London office, was told why she was off, and now me and another HF were now working on the project, and then why someone else was brought in to work on the budget. And it was like everything in [inaudible 00:13:11] in the office to the rest of the world that this project was going tits-up. But no one really wanted to talk about it. So, there were elements that needed a lot more thinking, and I think the client was expecting to be a lot more polished and concrete, which just wasn't possible during the time. So, it was both time constraints that way actually with kind of ... the client wanted ... I think the client needed it to be delivered to a higher level. So, when I joined towards the end, the team was just exhausted from trying to fight for what they thought was the right solution. But also just being told 'no', and never being told why. So ... But it then turned out actually that's why he's in the position he's in, because his hand has been held. He was the son of someone up in the [inaudible 00:08:26] there. So, it was really hard to kind of get the negativeness out of the team and get the team believing in the project again. I felt the client confirmed all my preconceptions about people that work in the media industry. In that they act as if everything is fine when you're in the meeting, and they were really happy with you and they loved you, and that `Yeah, we're really great friends.` And they'd get home and you'd get an email and they'd bitch. Or you'd get an email from someone else- It was a big ... The team really struggled early on in trying to find opportunity areas in something quite so vague; trying to understand the whole European entertainment industry. Yeah, I think ... Yeah, it did seem normal, but I think because of the clients, and the difficulties with the clients, they made it a lot harder to actually manage. Because the project manager ended up having to lead their project manager by the hand to get him to do what he should have been doing normally. They wanted something groundbreaking, but they weren't particularly good at articulating why they felt ideas didn't work. They'd go, `Oh, it didn't work.` And they would never consider that actually something can be done the right way. It was always, `Eh, we tried to think around that.` And it could be completely different concepts, or someone else tried doing it and it didn't work. And they were never kind of very good at saying, `Let's look at why this didn't work and learn from that.` It was very much, `That didn't work.` The business factors guy was, again, another consultant who's a not a 'how can we'. It was very much a 'you can't' rather than 'you could', which made it really hard to build on ideas. And that really kind of drove devising lines between the team. So yeah, the team ... that bit was the hardest. I think when they said 'next', they expected a whole new idea; a whole new kind of Pop Idol type concept to just appear from nowhere. And I think also for the team, not having ever worked in this industry as well, they found it really hard to keep coming up with these new ideas when they continually being told, `Oh, it's been done already.` But I think the thing was is that no one felt like ... It was really hard to relate the ideas back to the insight. And once there were threads that'd been snapped and broken and [inaudible 00:09:19] so it was ... I think that was the hardest thing is no one set their standards really high on what they wanted to deliver. And no one really felt that ... that had the time to actually deliver to the right level. And I think the client also was sightly expecting after to deliver to a level that was higher than was possible in the time. And I think we hadn't managed that expectation as well as we coulda done. -that they'd bitched to. So we never got ... It was actually never really directly from them; we'd always hear stories from other directions and the people we knew within the client about ... And we'd kinda have to try and patchwork all this together. There was ... Never came across very nice, we never really got ... Nothing was concise or anything. And so I don't think ... Because the client didn't understand the process we were using to test them and how well they work, because we use them regularly, they then weren't such believers. But I think, also, they really struggled with actually leading the desirability. But I think the one thing that did happen was as this project finished, we kind of ... A few of us kind of had a conversation with some of the senior leadership, and we made it very open that this project had been shit. When I say forced, it was more people really kind of ... You could never trust what someone was saying. You really had to think what's behind this and why they said it. So, rather than coming up with what they thought was a good idea and then working out ways it could be done, they had to see the business case before they could believe in the idea. I think that made things really hard for the team, because it's really hard to come up with a really cool creative idea when you kind of ... How can we make money, it's kinda being thrown ... Like, we don't know how it's gonna work; if it's desirable, and you're trying to ... And because of the time it was taking to get these concepts ready, the client couldn't' agree on which ones they wanted to take forward, that made it really hard to then help the clients understand.   I think that's what the team really struggled with because they ... I don't think the team felt that what they delivered was inspired by anything. They just felt it was just delivered. And I think the team went ... I think the team set themselves ... I felt I was kinda like a [inaudible 00:08:54] member that kind of touched the team but never was really part of the team. Although I probably was for the last four or five weeks of a sixteen week project.",

I think just don't want what we want, right? They don't know what they want, so make it finally what we did is ... it's his expectation. Me and the team member? We are work very good, also work very hard. We sketch together, discuss together, some just make joke, and make environment very relaxed. Actually, we work very well. The last one is ... yeah, we try to teach our clients what Ideal's process is, but very hard. I think they don't have design knowledge, like they just know what's design. They probably ... they just want to see the good picture, like good rendering. They don't care about the story, what's the story behind the [inaudible 00:09:43], they didn't care. They also don't care HF. They just care good looking. But sometime, we just start the idea phase one right? I think it's get some input from the team member. He said, `Okay, maybe we just up lot of meeting after meeting, we will decide, maybe these two is good for the clients.` But in that time, we not really understand what's the client's need. We just think that's good design for the design perspective, not for client's mind. Maybe some decisions wrong. Yeah. In Ideal not now, because I just join Ideal five months ago. I think now we did this project, I think seems things quite fit very well, because I joined HF phase, also discuss with HF people. We get very strong design direction. I think I also very agree also the direction more easy can get some idea. Sometimes from HF, direction from design is difficult, very difficult to create the design can fit this direction, more ... I don't know how should I say. Let's not talk about design sometimes direction. Yeah. But this time, I think it's good. Yeah. This project.   Last one. We did a project for a Chinese local company. Actually, I think we just spend some money hire Ideal do some design, but actually the clients don't know what's design. We create some good idea, but we don't use very, very good way to explain our ideas, just sketch, just very rough, 'cause client's can't understand. Yeah. Also, I think another thing is clients already spend a lot of money, so they're ... how to say?",

    "text": "Some input we should from client. They know everything. They already did 10 years. This good we can get a lot of knowledge about firm. Yeah. They did. They want us some part make it ... Yeah, it's quite innovation. We get some inspiration for this [inaudible 00:23:29]. Yeah. I think this quite help for us. The style of design can be very wide, so let's do this, we can exactly get the client's want. Budget, yeah. But [crosstalk 00:24:43] you know, because in my previous company, that time we have a lot of project, but we don't have a lot of people, so sometime I need to work two or three project together. Yeah. Budget is okay. Because I'm super busy. Time is not ... it's short. Very short. But for Chinese, they design 10 concept, maybe just two or three is good. That's different, right? Because the western people, they before doing, they get a lot of thinking, but Chinese people is doing and thinking, so that's different. Let's go back to clients. I think clients also want, `Okay, we need a lot. We need to see a lot. We need this project super fast done.` That's client's patient. Yeah But for Chinese, they design 10 concept, maybe just two or three is good. That's different, right? Because the western people, they before doing, they get a lot of thinking, but Chinese people is doing and thinking, so that's different. Let's go back to clients. I think clients also want, `Okay, we need a lot. We need to see a lot. We need this project super fast done.` That's client's patient. Yeah. Yeah. I think if work very well, we should work very closely with our clients sometimes. Maybe foreign clients, and western clients maybe more prefer the phone call, telephone conference. Sometime maybe Chinese people more prefer face-to-face discussing. I think that's good. It's maybe one week one time work with clients, because let they know what we are going to do, going on. It's can very close the clients, we know more about the clients, what they are want. Also, what we want, we should influence the clients. I think that's a good way, so for did the project. Communication with clients maybe more tough, but Chinese clients is okay. Yeah. I think I just maybe work very closer. Also, the team member, because some designers, they have very special personality like maybe just work in night, so we can't see anything from him, just through him. This is a problem, maybe we go out, have lunch, sometimes just make very good relationship, so can get him. PROJECT ID Communication with clients maybe more tough, but Chinese clients is okay. Yeah. I think I just maybe work very closer. Also, the team member, because some designers, they have very special personality like maybe just work in night, so we can't see anything from him, just through him. This is a problem, maybe we go out, have lunch, sometimes just make very good relationship, so can get him. Try to use the product, find a good way for user. Yeah. I think for industrial design, the use is very important, less than style, less than looking. We just try to different way like prototype, prototype a lot of time to test what the best function is, best use is. Yeah. Actually, they did a lot of documents for us, like what's the background about this product, what's the consumer? What's the work environment? Is this work product work environment, or technical input. Okay. They also did [inaudible 00:23:14] like they [inaudible 00:23:17] for the car, like a truck. They said, `Okay, this style we want, because we need very [inaudible 00:23:24].` Yeah. Some design consultancy, they want to change them. They want make a project very ... for the whole process, and want to create some innovation I think, but we don't have time, we don't have budget. I think both the environment, because the industrial design just started in China maybe 10 years. In the first two years, the design consultancy just like a factory. They just very cheap, and maybe with a lot of sketch, a lot of idea give client. Client says, `Okay, industrial design is cheap, right?` I think good is we did brainstorm with the clients together, so clients told a lot of their expectation. What's the technology? What's the consumer? We are quite understand very well. Because you know ID, industrial design, because we are touch a lot of products, sometimes we can't maybe design of home, we don't know maybe this project just three months. We can't know everything about this firm. [inaudible 00:23:47]. Just find some picture like iPod style, or this kind, this style, they can told you, because they know design. Like watch or something, maybe watch is very strong, very man, yeah. I think Fluke, because they want to develop the Chinese market. They want to find design friend like design consultancy to help them, because Chinese design consultancy understands the Chinese market, Chinese people. They are just start looking for some good company, they choose my previous company, but it's very careful. Something they consider a lot of time, `Okay, so just give you one project for let me see.`   I think maybe we should go back to think about Chinese people. From my perspective, I think Chinese people more like, `Okay, I just do this thing, done, and this can be fast, it has to be done.` But some international people, like western people, they can go very deep. They can do a thing very deep. They can do one more research just for one pen, right? They can find different opportunity for design this pen. But Chinese people, when they get this project, `Okay, just do this. Just start design this [inaudible 00:26:38].` Maybe they can create 10 concepts, but western people, maybe just create three concepts, but these three concepts is quite good.",

    "text": "Before is not too successful project, but I think it's not successful, it's not because, I think it's very complicated to say that one, because I think it's ideas process is very new for China. I think it's also important to let ideal to fit in this China market, because China's so different from the western country, and also the design environment here is so different. Also the client's perspective and what they can need, what they can't is also different. I think it's not the process that is the problem of itself, maybe it's just, it's not so fit in this market. Yeah, because you know the clients here are not so care about the research. What they want from a design consultancy is okay, I gave you money, you gave me the design. Look at the result, I get the feeling, I know that this is it, okay, this is it. If it's not, maybe, it's very hard to convince them. I think what we'll do is try to find a need or a big story, and what's the design come from from this story, now it's randomly an idea or just because it's beautiful. It's kind of hard to sometimes maybe getting some, maybe not, and it's depending on different project. It's also depending on different clients, what their needs from the project is also different. I think from the last project, which was a flashlight, it's very special because ... How can I say that? Because the company is actually not a big, big company which produce flashlight, so they don't really have a lot of money, which just means that they don't have so much money and time to get to explore very new product, but actually what they say, what they want is unique, unique flashlight, but it's very different. When we do HR phase to the daily, to the people, sometimes you ask one question, but maybe they answer it in another way. Maybe 10 minutes later, you have to ask a question again, but in the different ways, and try to get the core of their answers, because sometimes people say something, but they don't really mean that. I think this is [inaudible 00:09:54] for the client's part. Sometimes the clients say okay, I just want something cool, something beautiful, something that can sell a lot of money. It's [inaudible 00:10:03], you cannot get anything, right? I think it's very important for any project is to exactly get what is their perspective, what is they really want from this. I think if this works, the project maybe can work better. If not, because we can design something or do some work, but if it does not fit the client's need, it will not be successful. I think it's, maybe at first, I didn't want to teach the clients what we can feel, the design's just a product from this research. What is the core importance of research, because we know your clients, it means you know the market, then you can fit market, then you can get money from market. If you don't know that, it's minimized, right. Sometimes the client seems not interested in that part, just like last project, the clients fell asleep during the HR presentation. We even say 10 times, this is important. We never get it.  Sometimes the client seems not interested in that part, just like last project, the clients fell asleep during the HR presentation. I think this is what idea, we have to try to explore that idea. Also, this new project I have been through, I think it's better than before, the last one, because I think it's, we have [inaudible 00:11:55] here, which is one of the ideo founder, and he knows that it is very important to match our perspective with the client's one. During the end of the HR meeting, he is, because I kind of sound Chinese, and I think what we sign for the contract and what is the client's perspective not matched. I told him, and then he said even he didn't understand the language, he can get the feeling that it's not a match. End of the meeting, he tried to get his question clear, because he said if during this meeting, this problem is not solved, the rest of the work will be useless. No matter how beautiful a product you gave to the clients, they were never satisfied, because of the perspective. Yeah, I think it's why this project not really successful is what we gave to clients far away from what they can do and accept, because as I said, they don't have really a lot of money, but a really innovative product have to need time and money to let it go on market and tasks, but the clients, because they don't have that power, so they are afraid to try. They want the Ideo to make decision for them, but this is not what we do. I think this is big problem for them. Actually, Flash, because I didn't get involved into the HR phase and the flash project is to design a flashlight for American clients. I think it's very different, you know. Chinese people rarely use flashlight, but American people, maybe one people have eight or seven flashlight in their home. Actually, I think the behavior is different. For myself, I don't really have the experience of using or having so many different flashlights. Actually, none of our designer get involved into the HR phase, so we don't really can get the firsthand feeling from HR, and so from the thing that our colleagues tell us, there are some interesting needs, but I have used a lot of my time to see one of the flashlight [inaudible 00:22:07], different part of flashlight, and which sells a lot on the market, and also our clients like that flashlight a lot. That flashlight, actually, to be honest, at the first glance, I think it's super ugly. I don't know why people like to buy that. I know that it's a [inaudible 00:22:26] and they cannot take the light direction, it fit people's needs. When we know that clients are not satisfied with our work, I look carefully for selling one. I find that that flashlight already fits most of the need that we get for our research, so it means they're an already existing product, fits almost every need that we are doing now. I think it's ... that's really surprising, and I start to like it a little bit. For me, the flash design, I don't really think, for just myself, I think there are the perfect one are missing. I'm not really satisfied for myself for the design work, yes. I think it's, maybe at first, I didn't want to teach the clients what we can feel, the design's just a product from this research. What is the core importance of research, because we know your clients, it means you know the market, then you can fit market, then you can get money from market. efore is not too successful project, but I think it's not successful, it's not because, I think it's very complicated to say that one, because I think it's ideas process is very new for China. I think it's also important to let ideal to fit in this China market, because China's so different from the western country, and also the design environment here is so different The chop-chop, yeah. I also think the chop-chop company is better than the flash one, yeah, and they are willing to communicate with you. They are willing to hear your opinion, give their opinion to you, I think this is what idea, we have to try to explore that idea. Also, this new project I have been through, I think it's better than before, the last one, because I think it's, we have [inaudible 00:11:55] here, which is one of the idea founder, and he knows that it is very important to match our perspective with the client's one. the rest of the work will be useless.

    "text": "Cool. My most successful ad over the last while was one that I made, like, I actually presented four years ago. And I've always loved it, but they were too scared of it. And it took me four years to make it, and eventually we made it as a [inaudible 00:16:23] job on the back of another commercial. And it was just so, so successful. We didn't even put it on TV, because they still hadn't bought into it, but it just leaked on the email, the internet, and went all over the world through South African communities, very South African idea. And it happened like that. And for me, the lesson was to have faith in your ideas. 'Cause that idea, I'd have rejected so many times, but I really, really believed in it. And it was such a relief when I made it. It was such a ... almost a affirmation. Do you know what I mean? So, I don't quite know how to say that, but often the best and most successful projects are ones that happen completely outside of the system. You know, the system wants to do things in a very specific way, and will make it easy for you to do them, and will reward you for doing them one way. But often you have to act outside the system and believe in it and make it happen yourself. And just trust. Yeah. Trust yourself, trust your instincts. Unless you're an idiot, and then don't. Yeah. Half-tonner. Basically, the ad ... I'm gonna show you the commercial. It was a really dangerous commercial, because it's social commentary, and it deals with racism. And the ad, it's ... such a typical ... You see, there's a thing in South Africa with bakkies that no one talks about, but people drive to work, and there's a white guy driving a bakkie, with all the black guys in the back. It's a truth. But no one ever really acknowledges it. Yeah, well, like I said, we had to make it, and it had to be successful on the internet before they started going, `Well, we may be onto something.` Yeah. Well, it didn't exist. They didn't buy it, and so we made it on the side. Well, just me for four years, and then at the end I got my art director involved. It was two of us, basically. Literally it was [inaudible 00:20:58] the suits. No one ... it was my little project. I think eventually it kind of was one guy. When we've done our best stuff was when we had a client who was brave enough to make decisions, and there was one guy who was brave enough to say yes. Because the minute there's more involved ... Sorry, I'm jumping around. But a very good friend of mine, who's one of the top [inaudible 00:21:35] in the country, probably the top one. He said, `Creativity's not a democracy. And it can't be. Someone has got be brave.` You know, it's one person's vision, normally, that is often at odds, and you have to defend that vision until it happens. And you need a client who sees the vision, believes in it, and says `Yes.` The minute you start committee approvals, you're fucked. Because nothing will get through a committee unless it's been sanitized to the point of ... you know. Yeah, me, and then I've got a very good suit who's really good and supportive. And that's why I call, because if you don't get buy-in from them, you're fucked. Yeah, they did, and it came second to a much more inferior idea. And I actually told the research lady that she was wrong, we had a huge fight, and since, she's apologized to me, because I was proven statistically to be right. It's a fantastic ... it's such a cool case study. I did, I sent the list of awards that we got for this one, and the one that they ... you know. 'Cause my thing was that research will always help you to find the safest ad. Won't help you to find the best creative ad. 'Cause a lot of creativity doesn't make sense initially. And it's often ... if you ask people, `Does it offend you,` they may say, `Yes,` because it may be on an edge, you know. The most successful ads I've done have always been complained about. You know what, I've been arguing with them that they have to in some way build in the bravery factor, and I said to them ... she said, ` What are you basing your thing on?` I said, `My intuition.` That I've been doing this job for 16 years, and I'm eventually getting good at it, because I've made mistakes. And that's not measurable. But surely that's what the clients pays me ... that's what my experience is there for, is to make better judgments, you know? If research could do that, they wouldn't need creative directive. It was very simple. All our briefs are extremely simple, to the point of generic-ness. Which can be hard. But at the same time, I think often JWT veer in the other direction in that they create briefs that are so tight and are so specific and so strategically targeted that it's really tough. I like the brief to have a bit of leeway in that, so that a range of creative solutions can meet it. So generally, I would say vague. Yeah, time was just as long as I could ... long as it took me to find someone who would make it for me. Always been excellent. And, you know, the funny thing is that particular project has always done a huge amount for the relationship in that they've developed a lot more trust. So we sell them all sorts of crazy shit now.   If it's a small team, that's crucial as well that we get along and we like each other and we all pull in the same direction. Our strategy is cool, because if the guy disagrees with us, we intimidate him till he changes his strategy. We've only got one guy, so we get away with it. Zero. There's a corporate defense mechanism that, if you back a decision and the decision's a failure, then you're bad, so they'll do everything they can to make sure. They may take it to their bosses, but they'll never check in anything, because if it fails, there's ... It's horrible. It's pathetic. But zero, yeah. So generally, I would say vague. Strategy at JWT, as a whole, I find is hugely problematic. In that a lot of JWT, to me, think that they sell strategies, and often ... whereas all a strategy is really there to do is help us make better advertising. But somehow suits seem to thing the strategy is the end result, and then the advertising people try and fuck it up by making something. It's the wrong focus. The focus is too much on coming up with a kick-ass strategy, instead of creating a strategy that will help us make kick-ass advertising. Our strategy is cool, because if the guy disagrees with us, we intimidate him till he changes his strategy.",

    "text": "And basically what happened is we were all proposing ideas, and no idea ever satisfied everybody. Which is what we were looking for. And again, it's not a democracy. Someone needed to be in charge and make decisions, and no one was. And it went round, it went round, until the only solution that everyone was agreeing on was the one that was just the least offensive to everybody. So we weren't making the right ad. We weren't making the best ad, we were making the ad that offended the least number of people. And we tried to make our own, then, with like three weeks to go. It failed [inaudible 00:29:48]. Everything was bad. It was the ... for the launch of the Ford Focus. It was a big project, and it was a great lesson to me. It taught me so many things that I'll never do again, just that it ... worst to spring from us. You know the best creative ideas are pure and they don't get ... I find the best creative ideas exist, but they come to you as an idea. Very seldom is an idea where it's sort of a bit of this, and then you, `Oh, hang on,` and you work at it, and you panel beat it and whatever and it gets better. Do you know what I mean? Too many. Also. You know, the two main guys from Australia, the two main guys from New Zealand, the two main guys from South Africa, the two main guys from ... What a nightmare. Yeah, the higher the profile of the job, the lower the risk tolerance, because the more people they feel are watching them, you know? I'm lucky that I'm a rebellious person, that I've got a problem with authority, because it helps. Because you know, if you're gonna take risks, you're gonna make mistakes. And you have to be prepared to stand up and say, `Yeah, I fucked up.` Yeah, but you know, my degree as a creative director hopefully is that I have more successes than failures. But what I don't have is a ton of extremely bland, safe, non-offensive ads. I've had some really good ones and a couple of shit ones. I mean, you talk about those, and you ... Yeah. The brief was a problem, because what the selling proposition was defin- you know, people wanted it to be different in every market. So again, we ended up with something that was so vague as to be practically useless. I think their positioning was eventually smooth. Smooth. I don't even know what that means. You know, for ice cream, maybe, I don't know. But for a car? [crosstalk 00:33:42] That was a problem. You know, it was a cultural divide. And then got fed out, and then compromised by everyone having a dig at it. Basically we were ... I'm gonna answer that in a cynical way, in that our inspiration ended up being attempting to create solutions that would be accepted by the process. Which is like, I've just been through the same process in Bangkok now, and it's wrong. You end up saying, `Okay, China? Does this idea work in China? Does this idea work in ...` Instead of saying, `Hey, our job is to make the best advert we can for this product,` you end up saying, `We're here to make an advert that can run in ... be understood in eight countries.` And that's not the same brief. It was week after week after week. It was horrible. In that the process didn't create good advertising. They're perception was, `Hey, we're gonna put the best the global markets have to offer in a room, and come up with the best type of advertising. And save money.` And it didn't save any money, didn't create good advertising, didn't make anyone happy. Strained. Always, failure strains relationships. And I think those teams like success, and I think [inaudible 00:36:56]. Yeah, in that project not so good, 'cause I felt the strategy was at odds with ... was not helping us make good advertising. It got to a stage where you feel like all strat are trying to do is write the strategy the client will sign off. You know what I mean? And the purpose of the strategy is not to be sign-off-able. The purpose of the strategy is to help us create compelling campaign. So agendas get messed up, and then that leads to conflict. multiple markets. Specifically, Australia and New Zealand, some of the Asian countries, and South Africa. And first of all, it was sad, there was multiple creative directors involved, and that's ... it's a bad idea. And basically what happened is we were all proposing ideas, and no idea ever satisfied everybody. Which is what we were looking for. And again, it's not a democracy. Someone needed to be in charge and make decisions, and no one was. And it fell to pieces at the end. We pulled out of the thing because we realized the ad that everyone was agreeing on was not one that we thought was one we should run. And we tried to make our own, then, with like three weeks to go. It failed [inaudible 00:29:48]. Everything was bad. So again, we ended up with something that was so vague as to be practically useless. I think it had the most meaning in Australia. They've got, `Oh, smooth, mate.` It's almost a slang term that they really identified with, and none of us did.   Which is like, I've just been through the same process in Bangkok now, and it's wrong. You end up saying, `Okay, China? Does this idea work in China? Does this idea work in ...` Instead of saying, `Hey, our job is to make the best advert we can for this product,` you end up saying, `We're here to make an advert that can run in ... be understood in eight countries.` And that's not the same brief. I'm lucky, I've got a really good guy who heads the team, and he's very supportive. Win or die, he understands the risk / reward equation, and he'll defend our rights to make mistakes as well as he will to have great successes. So I'm lucky, but generally in JWT I think it's a huge problem. Yeah, in that project not so good, 'cause I felt the strategy was at odds with ... was not helping us make good advertising.",

    "text": "Well, everything's always positive in the end when it works. There's no real negatives because once it's happened it's happened, but- But the whole concept is there's this total luxurious woman getting dressed, all sexy, sexy. There's no real concept as such, but then she bites the Aero and it dribbles out, and she's holding it like you would, like doing a blowjob. Seriously, and this is Nestle we're talking. And some of it drops on her dress, like [inaudible 00:27:33]. And she, instead of getting upset ... It's like a five thousand buck dress, it's beautiful. And instead she just scoops it up with her finger like this and, mm, and sticks it back into her mouth. And it's like talking about the indulgence of Aero. But no, we wrote the script, we thought there's no way on God's earth that Nestle is gonna ever buy this, because their umbrella over everything is, `Good food, good life,` and if it doesn't fit into good food or good life, it ain't gonna happen. And blowjobs are strictly off Nestle's radar. t's like a five thousand buck dress, it's beautiful. And instead she just scoops it up with her finger like this and, mm, and sticks it back into her mouth. And it's like talking about the indulgence of Aero. But no, we wrote the script, we thought there's no way on God's earth that Nestle is gonna ever buy this, because their umbrella over everything is, `Good food, good life,` and if it doesn't fit into good food or good life, it ain't gonna happen. And blowjobs are strictly off Nestle's radar. Anyway, so you see this thing, they didn't mention blowjobs but they saw the whole luxury, the sexuality, the indulgence, the sexiness of it, and they bought it. And then you've got this really good director who does fashion photography, and he actually filmed this. And it's like, it's almost porn. It's like Vogue photography, Vogue magazine. And it's like, you know, it's almost ... It's just missing the Vaseline on the lens. And the ad turned out so beautifully, and Nestle loves it, and there was not a single step of the way there was a single problem. Once people all buy into the front, things go smoothly and they never go wrong. If people are a little bit hesitant on the front, there'll be changes all the way along the process, and that's gonna kill the ad at the end of the day.   This Aero one came straight after the huge success of Bayer One. If this ad had come before Bayer One, it would never have got off the ground. Again, based on a couple of good experiences, client's risk tolerance, client's trust, client's everything, goes way up. Make one mistake and it goes way down. Yeah. Well it wasn't a huge budget because it's just a variant brand, but it was a good budget. It was about a million bucks or something. We got a top, top, top model. We could afford a really good model, really good photography. It was all good. Timing was tight. It wasn't because of the launch, it was because they had to get the thing done in the financial year. But it happened. We were working like the week before Christmas which sucked [inaudible 00:32:16], but it was done. No one had to work nights, you know? No. But there's no such thing as there's an insane timing. If you're working late, your time has been crap. Aero? Very good now. It's the Nestle client service. Nikki, she's great, fantastic. We get on very well with the Nestle client service. It wasn't always like that, but that person- This one's fantastic, yeah. But no, we wrote the script, we thought there's no way on God's earth that Nestle is gonna ever buy this, because their umbrella over everything is, `Good food, good life,` and if it doesn't fit into good food or good life, it ain't gonna happen. And blowjobs are strictly off Nestle's radar. There's no real concept as such, but then she bites the Aero and it dribbles out, and she's holding it like you would, like doing a blowjob.

And blowjobs are strictly off Nestle's radar. We decided it was good, and then with client service, one person, strat one person, and then ultimately, manager director or something. But normally here the top management kind of trusts the marketing or client service people, so you don't go running to daddy every time, you know? They kind of stick here when things fuck up, not when things are going right. Quite loose. `Aero's got a new caramel variant, PS see existing Aero briefs,` which is, `Aero is a brand of luxury, indulgence, sexiness, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.` So we've been working with Aero for years, so you take all the basic Aero attributes, and say, `And now with caramel.`",

    "text": "Where was I? Oh yes, take something like Kellogg's kids' cereals. I'm not blaming them, because we've done some stunning ads with Kellogg's, and they're a lovely a client, they're one of my favorite. But you get this thing about it ... Like kids involved, and the basic premise of this ad was Coco Pops was actually good for kids, because it's actually just rice, chocolate, there's no preservatives, no calories, which apparently is a fact, it's got lots of vitamins and minerals in it. It's all good. But then you get like ... You've got a simple ad, the ad's written, it's done, the script's approved, things are fantastic. And then people start getting nervous. `Oh, we're talking to kids. Maybe we should say this and show more vitamins.` But then what everyone's forgetting is it's a 30-second communication, so they want more vitamins and minerals, but then you have to take out things like chocolate. And then, `Oh, we can't take out chocolate, 'cause that's what kids like.` So you've gotta put that in, and then this. And then people start getting very nervous and start running around, and then once that starts and the client starts doing that, then you get this micromanagement mindset takes over, and you end the pre-production meeting and the clients are all worried. So they say, `What color shoes is the kid wearing?` And we say, `Well, it doesn't really matter, 'cause you're not gonna see his feet.` `No, but they can't be like red or yellow, 'cause that looks like preservatives. It's gotta be like a brain or a neutral color.` And we're saying, `We're not gonna see his feet.` `No, no, stills,` you know? And things like that. Once a little bit of nervousness creeps in, and you start changing a creative idea ... 'Cause an idea on its own is the idea. But if you start changing the idea, the actual idea is gone, and what you end up with is a bunch of separate little five-second premises making up a 30-second commercial which is, what? Do the maths. Six separate ideas are being held together by 30 seconds, which isn't an idea at all. And that becomes very problematic. And I think you've watched enough TV ads in your life to see when there's one idea, or when there's someone saying, `Shit, I've got 30 seconds. I better fill as much information here as possible.` And the consumer sees that and he goes, `Oh, I'm going for a piss.` And that's a classic example of how selling stuff so horribly. Kellogg's? 50. I'm not joking. On something like that, they'll go down to the tea lady, and they'll say, `Do you understand this?` 'Cause they don't wanna make a mistake. See, TV's expensive. See, once starts someone getting nervous, it just spread like a disease, and they're asking everyone's opinion to everything, and then everyone's got an opinion as you know. And it was a different feeling. And so suddenly, what started off as a very simple, simple idea, has got at least 50 opinions involved in it, and there's no idea left at all, so you might as well do the ad, start again. Work it out yourself. No, look it's a nice, safe, big American brand. They don't take risks. I would think so. [inaudible 00:38:48] research. They'll do animatics first, that's the [inaudible 00:38:51]. Go, `I'll do that,` and they'll research the animatic to death, and I'll get the feedback from every LSM group, from LSM five, that's some uneducated peasants living in the townships, to every hysterical mother, to people who go, `Oh, Kellogg's poison children.` So I'll get every bit of feedback from about 10 different research groups at animatic. Range from people going, `I don't like the ad 'cause it's a cartoon.` It's a fucking animatic, bitch. Right through to like, `You poisoned our children.` So you get all that feedback, then we'll have a huge big research, feedback meeting where every single bloody housewife's opinion's also added to the mix, to add into the script, to fix it. I say fix it in inverted commas, you can't see my hands doing this. And then we will like adjust the script to the preview stage, and then it'll eventually hopefully get made after like 10 or 12 revisions. And then it goes on air, and then it goes post-researched, and then everyone tells you how boring it is because there's too much information in it, so then we get shat on. Time starts off being very adequate on these sort of jobs, and then once you've revised the script about 10 times because of 10 different idiot's feedbacks from the nutritionists to the tea lady, the time started to get tight. Then you make the animatic, and then you get more things. The time's getting tighter and tighter. Then the animatic goes into research, and then it's getting very tight. And then you get all this feedback from conflicting different groups and research, and then they all want these different changes. The nutritionist wants this more added in, and the client wants this, and the sales people want that. Night time's really tight, because you've got a 30-second add which has got about 80 seconds of information in it. Now that time's running out. You've still gotta brief directors, get director's treatments in. And when all these extraneous people start to get involved in the creative process, time goes out the window. And then it gets stressful. That one? It started off the normal way, and I think it ended up with piles and piles of cocaine, man, just to cope. No, it was the normal way. You come up with an ad for ... Working from Holly Davidson to hair shampoo for women to tampons to bras. It doesn't matter, it's all the same. A product's a product. You sell it the same way. So yeah, it starts off the same way. It can end differently, but it all starts the same. Well, my way. I don't know how other people do it, that's how I do it. Yeah. Christmas lunch at Kellogg's is the biggest room ever. They're all girls there. The Kellogg's girls are there. They are very nice, conservative, hard-working ... They're young and they have fun, and then as soon as they get with the agency they go, `Oh, agency people, creatives, they must party.` And these girls drink more tequila, more vodka ... Every tequila was Christmas lunch. Let me give you an example. It starts at 11 in the morning. The last one I remember finished at 4 o'clock the next morning, and I had to sleep from my car, 'cause I couldn't drive home, I was so smashed. And we have a rocking great time together. They're great, great people. They've got a hell of a huge trust in us at the agency, but they just are a serious American global company and they are, `I shall do this, and I shall not do that.` It was fantastic. The core team always gets on well, us and the client. It's just it gets frustrating ... Because it's such a good relationship, we don't wanna stuff it up by losing your rag with them. But it does get frustrating when nervousness sets in, and cowardice. I think it's cowardly to try to cover all these bases all the time. Either say your message, or don't. Don't try and say one message but then try and carpet it in another. And then people start getting nervous. `Oh, we're talking to kids. Maybe we should say this and show more vitamins.` But then what everyone's forgetting is it's a 30-second communication, so they want more vitamins and minerals, but then you have to take out things like chocolate. And then, `Oh, we can't take out chocolate, 'cause that's what kids like.` So you've gotta put that in, and then this. So they say, `What color shoes is the kid wearing?` And we say, `Well, it doesn't really matter, 'cause you're not gonna see his feet.` `No, but they can't be like red or yellow, 'cause that looks like preservatives. It's gotta be like a brain or a neutral color.` And we're saying, `We're not gonna see his feet.` `No, no, stills,` you know? And things like that. Don't go there, do you know what I mean? Everyone gets emotional, and you can't make a mistake and, `No, no, no.` [inaudible 00:37:15] from there, 10 clients involved. [inaudible 00:37:21] starts like that, and everyone else starts having to have input, and you can see how things there can go wrong. See, once starts someone getting nervous, it just spread like a disease, and they're asking everyone's opinion to everything, and then everyone's got an opinion as you know. And it was a different feeling. And so suddenly, what started off as a very simple, simple idea, has got at least 50 opinions involved in it, and there's no idea left at all, so you might as well do the ad, start again.

And yeah the first meeting I was into it, it was approved by the creative director and everything just was a smooth ride. No interferences from clients. It was good. I'd say they don't take a lot of risk at all. No, they didn't do research on this idea. It was a proctored idea. It was pretty basic. It was just 'come up with cool ideas and see what works.'   Yeah, there was no budget. So we got everything for free that we could. And time, time was fine. I was new so it was hard for me like, to make relationships with them but it went cool. They seemed fine to me. I have no idea actually. It just kind of came to me, I don't know. Basically, in effect it was a weight loss program offered out.

    "text": "Because it started off as a really big - like, campaign that could have sold a lot of product for them and then it's kind of been watered down to a campaign that's not really going to do anything, we don't think. That's basically it. Client got a presentation from another guy who was bringing in the cell phone air time, like thing so if you sent to a unique code you'd get airtime back from them. And this guy presented the idea to client, client loved that idea and when we tried to incorporate it into our bigger idea they basically said they don't want the bigger idea they just want the air time thing and it was very limited and very, like narrow minded. Yeah, we presented the idea - the big idea to them and they liked it and they thought it was cool and everything involved. And then later on they came back and said `No, we want to just have this one element in it and that's it.` We still have to sell four million bars, and. It was pretty involved. Pretty daunting because they wanted us to sell eight billion bars this year, which is pretty crazy. So it was really like, we had high expectations there to meet and we could've met them but I don't think we will now. No. The budget was too little for what they wanted. Time was pretty tight. No, we went in with above, like what money they had and they know they'd have to choose which elements they wanted or didn't want to make the budget like that. Obviously we just, we butted heads on the fact that they wanted to cap our, like three quarters of the campaign that we had thought of. So we spent a lot of time on it that they weren't going to run. They basically just felt that they had the money and they wanted to do what they wanted to do. Client service was cool and we already knew client service - the brand unit director, business unit director were kind of onboard halfway through the project so - obviously they aired more towards the client side because they're trying to make the relationships with the client and stuff so we had a bit of, not seeing eye to eye. But generally, it was fine. like narrow minded. And this guy presented the idea to client, client loved that idea and when we tried to incorporate it into our bigger idea they basically said they don't want the bigger idea they just want the air time thing and it was very limited and very, like narrow minded.   I think a lot of financial decision and some preference and maybe not really understanding the problem at hand. Yeah. I mean the relationship with Kit-Kat hasn't been the best for awhile anyway. So, there's always a bit of tension there.",

    "text": "Yes, yeah. It's clients not really knowing what they what and client being afraid to make decisions and client ... We don't know what the background story was but every time we'd come to them with something, it'd be wrong. Eventually we had just the worst work that you could imagine. We were so disappointed with it but after a while, you could fight the good fight but eventually after two years, you want to get this thing done and so you're willing to just take it and give client something that if you turned on the TV you'd quickly switch it off. But that's the way it goes. You can't win them all. That's another thing, you know? Every couple of months it'd be a new person, a new boss, a new person in charge. That's quite important because that makes a big, big difference. You get these guys that are new on the business and they kind of don't know what to do but they feel the need to push their weight around because they got this position, because they feel they have to, so they start pushing their weight around the wrong directions and making wrong decisions. The brief was two years ago. It's just basically advertise Sun Silk hair straightener or hair relaxer or the whole wrench. It's just pretty broad but then things got changed and they forgot that you have to put in the [inaudible 00:29:34] necessarily and whatever so we had to go back to the drawing board. They wanted to advertise on 8 out of 10 women agree, but legally they can't say that. We were just going back and forth and trying to focus on 8 out of 10 women agree. We made up this idea about this team of women, like a Charlie's Angels, 8 out of 10 women are like this, concept, and scrapped. There's never enough budget. Impossible. It's hardly ever impossible. Client services is very good at that. Clients have got money. Unilever, Kellogg's and Nestle, but timing, that's where we clashed heads again with clients and that. We want to get it done and they want to get it done, but they start blaming us when it goes over time, but we had something that we liked and we thought was right from the beginning. Sometimes they go a big 360 and wasted so much time, or they want to be on air next week but they still can't decide what they want and somehow that's our problem, our mistake. There was no inspiration. There was defensive. There was just reactive decisions make and the inspiration was basically trying to find out what was inside the client's head and what they wanted. There was little time to look for any type of creativity or inspiration. It started off like that but it quickly disappeared. Well, in the way that we were always getting blamed. A big thing was, considering we worked on it for two years, I met with a client in person once. Everything else was on the phone or through client service which also made things difficult. Strategy didn't even really come into it. There's no sense in strategy with a Sunsilk client. They think they know everything. We don't know what the background story was but every time we'd come to them with something, it'd be wrong. We were so disappointed with it but after a while, you could fight the good fight but eventually after two years, you want to get this thing done and so you're willing to just take it and give client something that if you turned on the TV you'd quickly switch it off.

Can your relaxer give it to you this straight?` That's just kind of clever, trying to be clever copy. There's no real concept in that. The concepts were thrown out the window in the first year, so there's a lot of back and forth with just what they want to show, how big should this font be, what are they trying to say, what does this lady look like, what are the colors going to be.   Think that's probably the main problem. There's no communication and it took two years. These things aren't coincidence. It was me and Ronnie at the time. We weren't nearly as close as Chris and I. Chris and I are two years apart. We're both creative but [inaudible 00:34:38] both guys, we've got more in common. Ronnie has got all the experience in the world, but she's an older lady and I'm a younger guy. We work very well together professionally, but that's more suitable to working at a bank. For creative purposes, it's better to work with somebody who's like you and somebody you can kind of just click with.",

    "text": "Well there's the Kit Kat one which I explained earlier. That's the kind of latest one we did. It's important in an agency to have a creative director who's on the same page as you. JWT is a funny place because before I arrived, I hadn't won any awards but then as I arrived, fortunately we had a guy called Ron McKinnon join us and Ron McKinnon, he's like the don on advertisers in Africa. He pushed proactive. So a lot of ideas, you know as soon as you get a big guy behind you, who's also a judge, then things start going well because then you're on the same page. He wants to do creative and you want to do creative and so I've had a lot of proactive ideas for awards that have gone really well lately. In fact, the first idea I had when I got a chance is three years ago, was an idea to link the Apple shortcut keys, so Apple save. So you show a picture of cat up a tree and it just says Apple save, and it says `If only life was Macintosh.` That's the one idea I had and then I worked with my creative director and then we had all this Apple quit, Apple escape, Apple this, Apple that. Next thing you know, this thing is entered and won and was amazing. From that, we've had a couple of ideas that have been working like that. When we have the agency involved, the creative director involved, and you've got production involved to help us work up budgets and get voice artists, and you've got my art director Chris who you'll meet, he's superb. He's very, very good. So things work well when everyone's on board. Even if, for proactive, it's a lot easier because clients don't come into it as much as they do with normal briefs. It's nice to do really nice ads and briefs and win awards, but it happens a lot less than when you have the carte blanche to do with proactive, when you're just allowed to take up and go. The process was quite hard. It started off, at the very open the whole agency had it and Kit Kat, they know what they don't like and they don't really know what they like. So we were just kind of flapping around not knowing where to go really. Then another team [inaudible 00:14:06] came up with an idea of a little, `Woohoo` device as a reminder to have a break, so a little Kit Kat chocolate figure will go, `Woohoo,` have a break. Chris and I and the creative director Dave, weren't that keen on it but we presented it anyway as luck would have it, the client loves this thing and they want it to be the new Coke `Brrr,` you know the `Brrr` campaign. They want it to be as big as that. We were a bit doubtful. Anyway, we pushed and pushed and pushed. Eventually we managed to build an idea around the the `Woohoo` of a person in a queue who hears a `Woohoo,` takes a bit of a Kit Kat and then something cool and amazing and fantastic happens around it. Sure thing. But yeah, all they wanted was like literally a chocolate finger with a little chocolate mouth going `Woohoo` and that scared us, the image and the idea. So we managed to push back and at the end of the day we kind of held their hand and led them through the process and explained to them if they want to make this a [inaudible 00:15:21], what makes it [inaudible 00:15:21] is that the advertising, they think they're cool. They think they know what's cool. They've done all their research and they know what ticks, but the reality is far different. What happens is they think they know that this will work but it's not. It really isn't so we had to kind of lead them through it. Together, we got to a place where we had a garage and people were break dancing. We had a conference call and the glass started singing Marvin Gaye. We phoned one of Gaye's producers and we got the rights to the song. All incredibly exciting, especially for us at the tip of Africa to be talking to Marvin Gaye's producers and that kind of thing and getting the rights for this. Terribly exciting. Then, we got a good director and we got good music and we actually managed ... and the whole time ... do you want to get it? That's okay. But the whole time we're pushing client, we're also kind of cutting away at this `woohoo` thing. Eventually, it became ... and they hear the song, the ` Woohoo` but they don't even know if it's in the bag or in their heads, it's just a little pneumonic, a little reminder and at the end of the ad it's just have a break, `Woohoo,` have a Kit Kat. That's all it became. That's believable because that kind of works into the story. Why else would he look in his bag and get reminded of the Kit Kat? It certainly does break away from animated chocolate. So we were very happy at the outcome and I think it did well for Kit Kat and it did well for us. That's what you do in advertising. That's what you have to do because we work for clients, but at the same sense, clients don't pay [inaudible 00:17:06], JWT because I'm working with JWT, and advertising is a funny thing. You're trying to build up your portfolio. You don't want to- It's hard not to be selfish in advertising, but you want to make nice ads for an agency and a client and yourself. I think with Kit Kat we did. I've got a nice ... I might go work in London next year and having a nice Kit kat, that's an international brand, is something really nice. Everyone walked away from it very happy. Me, the agency and client. They're not tolerant at all. A lot of JWT's, we align globally with a lot of clients which causes a lot of problems because they have to report back to some boss in America, so they're not willing to take chances and everything has to go into research and stuff like that so they're very defensive. They're making defensive decisions rather than practical decisions all the time. We've got Kellogg's, Nestle, and Sunsilk and all three of these clients, they just want to advertise. They just want to get their brand out there. They don't want to be creative. They don't want to take chances. They don't want to create a stir. It's our job to make an ad which will stand out to people in the room and say hey, have you seen the cool kid get out with the dudes in the garage and dance? They can be pretty hard. And the clients, they're above us so they get final say so if they think that if they say wild swooping statements like actually black people don't watch television, you can say, `Yeah, they do,` but at the end of the day if they say they don't, they don't. It makes it really hard for us. It's kind of walking on egg shells. Low medium. This is broad, though. You have like Kellogg's are more medium. Nestle are low medium. Sunsilk are very low. Sunsilk they just want to put hair, face, smile, ad. That's it. They don't want anything else and we can push and push and push as much as we want. These things are funny. Clients, as I said, they know what they don't like. So they'll write us a brief and we're pretty sure we've got it right and we got to them and they actually don't like this work. By round three or four of presenting to them, the brief is really been forgotten about. Clients service start doing it now because they start showing them the brief and saying, `Look, this is what you wanted. How can you get angry at us? We're giving you what you wanted.` No, and there was always some excuse and us creatives do try not to be political. We're not client service, we don't try to get involved. We just sit there and [inaudible 00:22:21] back and forth and writing ideas. Bitter, you know. If things were going well, then the relationship is good. If they're going badly, then suddenly the agency's about to get fired and client services is sweating. With this one, it was good. The clients on this, they might be old school and reporting to some boss and making defensive decisions, but they're nice people. When it works, it works and they're not ... you can't talk to them. You can say this is what we feel and stuff. They don't shut you down as they could have earlier if the job wasn't going well or as some clients can. I think what JWT has done and what Rob has started is a bit of a snowball effect. Most clients are here because, internationally they have to be here. But what Rob started was a push. For me, that is key to creativity and another reason why [inaudible 00:24:58] is that you push clients into new territories. Every job, just make it a little more creative, a little more creative, a little bit more creative. That kind of, even that Rob's left, that momentum hasn't stopped. I think they're starting to appreciate and see it. I think the rewards are coming from international, from their bosses. We're working on [inaudible 00:25:17] too and we've written such a good script that it's going to be an international ad which is [inaudible 00:25:23] exciting for me. They don't shut you down as they could have earlier if the job wasn't going well or as some clients can. I think what JWT has done and what Rob has started is a bit of a snowball effect.

Nicki Park, I'm sure you'll meet her maybe later. She's fantastic. Client service, they've got a hard job. They're really on the rope in a tug of war competition and they get stretched and pulled. But it was good. It all ran very smoothly but like on Sunsilk job then it worked and the client will, they can never be wrong even if they are. So they'll be shouting at us and going off and not to ask creative but to poor old client service and come back to us and say, `Sorry this is what's happened,` and back and forth and back and forth. There's been a Sunsilk TV job which had been in the works for two years. I mean, client service and that, it's got to be tough. But our client service is very, very good. Strategy. Also good, also good. We've got Lou and Davina who's head of strategy. They're amazing. Very strong woman. Another thing, [inaudible 00:26:42] she's very good here. Every cog works well. There's maybe one or two people who are a little bit loose, but I mean it's good. .

It's having a break, escape, it's all those kind of things. So we turned them all together, we put it in, we mixed it around and said, okay. We had a whole bunch of ideas. They got cut down to this karaoke and to this dancing. I mean, client service and that, it's got to be tough. But our client service is very, very good. It all ran very smoothly but like on Sunsilk job then it worked and the client will, they can never be wrong even if they are",

    "text": "One that went extremely well, we sort of hit those mental blocks. We hit very, very early on. From there on out, everything just seemed to flow. Whereas again another time, things went extremely well until we hit a block, then it all just fell apart. I definitely feel some sort of... We feel like rock stars when we're actually nowhere near rock stars. You kind of need that wake-up call very early into situations so that you can judge, `Can I do this in second gear or can I do this in fifth gear, high speed or... Do I really need to work on this or not?` The brief was quite open. It had a specific mantra that it had to go into at a specific problem. It was to create awareness about their charitable thing that they were doing, but at the same time increase sales in the lower markets. From our research, we spent three weeks in Soweto. We found that it was almost impossible for them to do this, because they do it differently, they have certain foods that they stick to and if they do eat Kellogg's they are supplied the expired product from the spa or the shops, because they can't sell them. The idea was to, obviously talk to the highers, which would filter down a higher [inaudible 00:19:01] and the opinion leaders and those kinds of people. Yeah, well the living standard measure. People were losing time shares so the charitable thing was for rural education and stuff like that. They wanted to obviously increase sales whilst creating awareness and they don't have TV as much as highers do, and they don't really buy Kellogg's because they can't afford to. So, if we were talking to them and talking to the wrong people- Research. We spent those three weeks doing actual research... Well, we spent three to four weeks doing the actual campaign. The research was... We went into the town shops and spent- Yeah, nobody really does the research, we sort of have a gut feeling. Back then we were quite forced into the research element, we had to prove everything going through, and we fold a lot of stuff. We did interviews, we did questionnaires at the same time, but at the same time it was doing more of less, we would focus on the little things. It was a there and then kind of decisions. We had our lecture was whenever we had to ask a question we would write out an email, give it to her, she would look at it, assess it and send it through and receive feedback. Very well. They received it quite well. They have a very weird way of doing things, I think they'd be great salespeople. They knew exactly what to do, and they were also creative. They knew where we were and needed to be done. Great. Very good. They were involved in everything. They were very keen on it. They definitely thought it was better than their agency's suggestion, but at that stage they had already gone with the agency's suggestion because of time or whatever. They were very keen on it. oundaries and constraints on the project / was budget or time an issue? We went into the town shops and spent- Basically, that's where the campaign concept came from, is the little things. These people take so much pride in the little things and use the little things to add value to their lives. So, that's where it came from. It was fine. The communication was good. We could explain everything to them and they could understand it. There was no, `We'll think about this. We'll talk to you later,` kind of thing.   Within the team decisions were also... We had one figure, one figure head, and he basically delegated. There was one person who was in control of where we were going with the whole thing, sort of combining everybody's efforts into one. Broke it down into sub-divisions, basically. Same as an agency.",

    "text": "Project that didn't go so well... I don't think there's an option for a project not to go well. Yeah, it's definitely the process. Well, there was one and it was received well by the client's representative whoever they were, and they would approve everything and say... Well, not approve, but they said, `This is great. I'll take it back and present it to my people.` She took it back and presented it to her people and came back and nobody liked it. There were too many heads that she was talking to and they were contradicting each other about certain things. They were being subjective about everything and not objective. So, that came back. We found another route, did it, worked well. Fit it in nicely with a global position on [inaudible 00:25:29] Services. Well, she took a presenter, too many heads, came back and then we decided to try a different route. Always. You know I am. So, we tried a different route and took it quite far until we decided the client service actually decided we need to have... To consolidate everybody and sort of consolidate all the opinions and discuss them first before we can move forward. We did, and it just all came together, slotted into place and it's now on it's way out. So, very happy. They're having a few issues. Very tolerant. I'd say it's medium, because the argument was structured in such a way that they could not second guess us. We had, again, researched, backed-up, previous campaigns that have done a similar thing, 'cause that's what they wanted the money to do some of the things. So, we used their results and the feedback from the consumers that they got and incorporated it into our rationale. Their minds were put at ease before we went into creative and discussed. We had to do wacky things. Interesting. They did not really know what their problem was.  It was impossible, because they said their consumers were illiterate or unintelligent and very literal. So, we had to educate them in all of this and we basically came to the decision that this had to be a process. They wanted to... I wouldn't say they even knew their consumer, but they wanted to educate and create awareness all in one ad or one campaign. It was impossible, because they said their consumers were illiterate or unintelligent and very literal. So, we had to educate them in all of this and we basically came to the decision that this had to be a process. Oh, the brief. The brief was indecisive. No, it could have been a lot more useful. Yes, basically. It got re-drafted and changed into a simpler message to follow through. Well, timing was not appropriate. They wanted everything here and now when it just wasn't possible, but also everything they were asking for. The budget was completely inappropriate. No, we convinced them otherwise. Especially on timing and the budget. I mean, if they wanted it done now, it's rather better to wait a while and do it properly, because you only have so much budget. I mean, you don't want to do it again. Basically, they decided to do the three phase, or the yearly process- Very young. There's no real relationship yet, they're still building it I think. I think we just got the client at the beginning of this year. Relationship's not there. They need to have a rapport- They did try. They took everybody in for conference, well not everybody, a select few people went through to a conference in Dubai and spent time with their people, our people. Getting to know each other. So, it definitely kick started things off, but a once off doesn't really fix it. Very good. Very good. Definitely buddy-buddy. Client service? Also good. Not buddy-buddy, but good enough. Yeah, could be tighter. The strategy, it was also a very good relationship, yet at the same time looking to them for answers, I mean they're there to tell us, `Are you right, are you wrong,` because Kenya in my mind looks different to Kenya in their mind and they've obviously done research on it. Sort of look to them for inspiration and solutions within their answers. They were being subjective about everything and not objective. So, that came back. We found another route, did it, worked well. Fit it in nicely with a global position on [inaudible 00:25:29] Services.

There were too many heads that she was talking to and they were contradicting each other about certain things. Pretty large. Large, I'd say. The idea is they really never had a big picture. They sort of did, but they didn't tell us about it. Our picture was a little bit smaller than theirs. They have phases that they want to go through, so a yearly thing. This was supposed to be something memorable, that could carry on-   hey wanted to... I wouldn't say they even knew their consumer, but they wanted to educate and create awareness all in one ad or one campaign. It was impossible, because they said their consumers were illiterate or unintelligent and very literal. So, we had to educate them in all of this and we basically came to the decision that this had to be a process. The brief was indecisive.

    "text": "It just clicked? It usually doesn't just click. There's usually something wrong that just goes haywire. Oh God, something that went right? It's easy to think of something that went wrong. I'd say when I was working on the EBS guidelines. I did their corporate guidelines for them. The reason why it went well is because it just all came into play. It was a lot of work, and it was so much to put out. Once I got through it and I put it out, it was actually quite a success. It was a long procedure, and it was a lot of work, but it wasn't a hard procedure. It wasn't like I battled with it and things went wrong, it was just a long process, but it went quite a while. No, wasn't very innovative. It's a guideline- No, you've got to be able to know what ... you're busy developing someone's brand, and you're going to tell them what they can and what they can't do with their brand. There is definitely research in ... if I say, `Okay, you can't do this with your brand,` what's going to happen in five years time? Who's going to be wanting to do what to your brand, and keep your brand fresh, and keep it innovative within the structures? Yeah, it's a lot of research going in, looking at other CR guidelines, what other people are doing, what can they do, spacing, the environment within. So, it is a lot of research that comes into it. The brief was basically, `Come up with a corporate guideline for us within three weeks,` which was hard to type in the deadline. We had a very short period of time to do it than what we usually would have had. With the guideline. I mean, some guidelines can take six months to do, but this was a very small one. Then, I'd say, budgets, no, not big budget. Appropriate. Appropriate budget, but not- Nothing extravagant. To make it easy for someone, me inspired me, because when I get a guideline, a corporate identity guideline, and I have to now go use ... it's very important for me that I have my restraint, obviously, but I also have my freedom to play with the brand. I was thinking, `I want to make a corporate identity guideline so that if somebody like me someday has to design something for this company, they don't feel like, `Oh my God, I can't do anything for this stuff.` So, I think I would say me, as a designer, was an inspiration to designing it. They come in, they give their 10 cents worth, you tell them, `No, we can't do it like that. That's not how it's done.` So, normal relationship. Nothing over the top exciting, and nothing bad, never bad. It's not a very innovative project. Most of the innovative projects don't get made. You do this great stuff, and you come up with these great ideas, and the client doesn't like it, and you go back to the boring stuff. eah, it's a lot of research going in, looking at other CR guidelines, what other people are doing, what can they do, spacing, the environment within. So, it is a lot of research that comes into it. Then, I'd say, budgets, no, not big budget.   I have a very good relationship with Mel. She gives me good time when I needed it, she gave me extra time when I needed it. She also ... I can tell her straight, `Listen to me, we've got a bit of a problem. Please, please,` and she would go ahead. She liked the work that I did for her.",

Unfortunately, due to budget ... I wouldn't say budget, and I'd say client, it got cut, and it wasn't done anymore. I did a shit load of work for absolutely no reason, and that's how I'd say it was disappointing. It wasn't the fact that the work was disappointing, it was the fact that you do all this work, and it gets cut down and you don't get to produce it, which is very, very disappointing. So, I'd say that's a disappointment. No. Well, it was supposed to be this huge launch of it in South Africa, and they made such a big deal about it. Then suddenly they just canned everything. So, it was supposed to be a big brief, but it turned out that they made it into a small brief. No, we were going to make a stunning brochure that was going to twirl and stuff, so I would have said the risk factor was quite ... they were willing to take a risk on it, definitely. I'd say medium, not like in they willing to blow the [inaudible 00:26:20], because it never happened, but at first they were very excited, and then they canned it, which sucks. I was looking at a way ... it's a lot of information to put on one brochure. I was thinking of how could we make it fun and interactive, yet informative. I think that's what inspired me, is the trying to appeal to people, but with so much crap of information, with so much information. So, I'd say that inspired me, and also some ... obviously looking at how you can make a brochure fun. Usually a brochure is a piece of paper. Good, as in, good relationship, but in the end it got canned. So, I wouldn't say it affected the relationship, so I'd say good. Money.   It wasn't the fact that the work was disappointing, it was the fact that you do all this work, and it gets cut down and you don't get to produce it, which is very, very disappointing. So, I'd say that's a disappointment. I also think that the priorities were different, and that their priority wasn't on this, although it should have been. That's how I think it got canned. Because it's an understanding. They didn't have money. We just sucked it up, shed our two tears, and walked out the door. I think it was because there were so many people working on it, and so many people having to make decisions, that it's starting becoming this, `Okay, no, no, no. It's important for me. No, no, no. It's important for you. No, no, no, no, no. We need ...` and then, I think, through too many people in charge, having too many people in charge, it fucked up that way.",

Both brands all worked well together but some brands don't ... You know that one party, it's like there's never an even balance between two things. So, yeah, the one was playing in the other one's territory and they were all corned, it was great. I suppose cocktails, everyone drinks. Yeah, because we thought it out from the beginning to the end, everything was up to us. So all that they said was that we have to sell Appletiser and we have to make cocktails with it in. They gave us a budget and they said, `Well, do whatever you want.` So they said, `Okay, R50,000-00 is what we have and you guys can do whatever you want with it.` So that was cool then you have ... Look into your freedom to just choose whatever prize, and then all the mechanics are up to you so it isn't lik someone else does the mechanics, you get it from there and then you try and do something to make it fit with that, do you know what I mean? So from beginning to end was our problem and obviously then it's easier. News Café is pretty cool with that because obviously because they into the younger people like the trendier people going there so they always have to be innovative in what they doing so, they were quite open to it which was nice and their briefs were always like, do something different. But other clients obviously have their way of doing things, they're like, they've got their blue print and this is how they do things and you have to do it like that. Well it was the Appletiser, it was nice to just work out something different and something that's ... It's such a clean brand. Like the apple is very simple, it's very elegant so, that kinda stuff is cool to work with because it's iconic in a way. So, yeah, we just used all the Appletiser stuff rather than News Café. Firstly, they gave us the mixologist so it was cool, they were totally, whatever we want, whatever cocktails, he was there, the mixologist came through and he worked for News Café and then yeah, I suppose they were a very quick and easy process to actually which direction they wanted to go for. So that kind of yeah ... eah, because we thought it out from the beginning to the end, everything was up to us. So Appletiser didn't belong to us but we handled everything.   No it was cool, like I said, they gave us ... They said, `Here's R50,000-00, you have to sell Appletiser,` and we have to have cocktails, we have to mix the Appletiser in cocktails. And that was it. `Do whatever you want, use any point of sale elements, whatever works.`",

Okay so we just had to do a TV ad. Tempo hadn't advertised in years and the last ad that they had done was this jean ad and it was just like break dancing re-make thing and so they needed something a little more modern so we came up with a concept. The client then changed the concept within the same execution. So the client was quite difficult and yeah, eventually we got to make it and editing was an issue. And then, like I said, they didn't like the end results and it went out 'cause there wasn't anymore time and apparently the audience liked it so ... Relatively. I think we were about 80% happy with it. Because of limited budget as well, we couldn't get the directors and things that we wanted. So you limited to a certain type of director who ... They're not always as creative or as, he wasn't young either. He was sort of probably middle aged. So it was quite hard to try and give him the whole vibe and how to [inaudible 00:11:36] and the kinda people we talking to. We talking to 16 - 24 year olds, so it's quite young. Three young people, one ... And I don't know what their positions are. Five. Five people, yeah. They were willing to do it in the beginning and they were happy with the idea, obviously, then further down the line they ... I think was starting to have doubts. Yeah, we had decent-ish but just like I said, I mean a thing like that could've used more money. They had about one and a half. I think some of the quotes came in at 2 million which ... Yeah, so, it was okay. Good in the beginning, not so good at the end. See. the way that they work is that the three younger people would come in to the first briefings and they would be great, they would love the ideas. And they would then later on, the main guy would come in and he would wreck the whole thing and we'd have already gone so far down the line and then he would come in and he'd have an opinion and totally just change everything. So, with the younger ones, it's always been good. With him, it's always been difficult, he's always been cynical, is the word, about what we've been doing. Strategy actually played quite a big role in that one. We sat a lot with strats and to come up with ideas, actual executions because most chocolates and stuff like that don't really have anything to sell. They're not always as creative or as, he wasn't young either. He was sort of probably middle aged. So it was quite hard to try and give him the whole vibe and how to [inaudible 00:11:36] and the kinda people we talking to. We talking to 16 - 24 year olds, so it's quite young. Yeah, I think because it was quite technical. It was quite a technical ad and they're quite used to doing like 'sweet stories' because Cadbury's always been lovey and happiness and this was something really different so ... With him, it's always been difficult, he's always been cynical, is the word, about what we've been doing.   Yeah, you see, apparently on his side, his thing was, `Just make me famous.` He wanted ads that just made his name like really huge 'cause he came from SAB, just huge and so, I think there was a bit of ego involved on that side, and there was politics in the company because I think they wanted to move to another agency, so there was all these factors influencing all this whole and here we are trying to do a TV ad.",

    "text": "They ranked from ... Although the hierarchy in IDEO is fairly flat. There are people with more responsibility. I think for us, with the second phase at Generali, we made sure they worked together, rather than at separate points. I think one of the things that lots of creative environments suffer from is opinion occurring at different points in the process, instead of opinions occurring together and then you're `Okay.` That's where a change in opinions occurring together. There can be a shift in some of that thinking but it becomes very difficult if you have opposite, polar opinions at specific points in the project. I think generally, most of them are very sort of risk intolerant. Mainly because if they make a huge mistake, their jobs are on the line, I would imagine. I think one of the interesting factors for me, my most immediate path would be marketing. In the mainstream, it's becoming more difficult to find people who will take risks. Those are all extremes, but it's becoming less and less, specifically more in terms of brand design. People who are sort of ... It felt to me like it was almost becoming formulaic. It's very difficult to find someone to sit down with and go, `Right, what do you want to do?` `I really wanna change the world. I really wanna do this.` Very rarely does that occur, and so they almost have their however many hundred pounds a year job and they're a marketing director at whichever large corporation and they don't wanna rock the boat. And in Generali's case. In Generali's case, it was difficult I suppose. In the beginning we had three main collaborative workshops with them to build up this innovation capability. In the beginning, I think they were very sort of cynical. They came from different areas of the business, which is great because you had a complete convergence of all of their areas of business and all, enough. They were quite cynical in the beginning. As the collaborative nature went through the free workshop, they actually kind of ... I think they saw. Well, when they understood the work as well, and we had created it together, we hadn't said, `This is what we think. You do it.` It's very much, `This was your opinion. We had brainstorms. You said you wanted this. We've written these things down. Here they are.` I drew them up as frameworks. This is where you do this. These are the elements. I think at that point, they suddenly felt empowered by it. They presented it as well to their peers, their CEOs. We didn't present it. It was their project. And because it became their project, they immediately bought into it. The risk seemed to disappear for them because it's like we are the [inaudible 00:21:27]. Or we stay as we are, which is the status quo, it's boring, and it's not gonna help us in the future. We need to do this. So there was almost like a belief, a switch, like a religious belief almost that they had this feeling. So I suppose both being that collaborative and allowing them to present it to their own peers, the risk became almost negative.  But in the end, we had a sort of period of gap where the client kind of disappeared for a little while and then reappeared, and because that gap occurred, we had a lot more of a tighter schedule to get things done, which was a plus and a minus. I mean the minus would be that obviously we had to work slightly longer hours to get things done. But in the end, we had a sort of period of gap where the client kind of disappeared for a little while and then reappeared, and because that gap occurred, we had a lot more of a tighter schedule to get things done, which was a plus and a minus. I mean the minus would be that obviously we had to work slightly longer hours to get things done. The plus is that actually you focus and you go, `Okay, we have to make a decision. [inaudible 00:22:52]` you make a decision, you stick with it, and then you go, `Okay, this is incorrect.` And you change and you rapidly prototype constantly. Which is great and actually a quite interesting way of working. More like how I would normally work actually, how I had worked outside of IDEO. Rapid designs, presenting, and then changing iterations. I suppose it came partly from the client themselves, in terms of understanding where they are now and where they needed to be, so it was very much listening to them, we get an understanding of the structure of an innovation capability, what the elements are. But it's almost like these are sort of empty compartments and then by sitting down with the clients, saying `These are the compartments. What do you do currently? What do you do wrong? How do you see it? What would you like to do? What would be your ultimate dream environment, job, and incentives, and all the different elements?` And by doing all of those things, it brought out the ultimate inspiration for them, and I think that was key because we could redesign something that we perceive to be a really great innovation capability, but it doesn't fit Genera And I think that's probably one of interesting keys to it was that it was actually a new form of Generali, not this new fantastic new innovation capability. So it was like a happy medium. It was a place for them to feel comfortable and build from, and have a roadmap starting point to get to where they need to be. So the ideas that we come up with now may be redundant in two years because they may have changed certain technological advances or something like that, but the starting point now is them and what they need. I think, speak to Nate and he would say something different in terms of getting hold of them. They would be difficult to get a hold of. I've had this before with clients as well. When they ring you, you kind of jump and `Yeah, how can I help you?` When you need their help, they're very difficult to get a hold of, generally. Yeah, great. I mean we ... Sectionizing outside. There was ... We had a sort of exercise routine we would do together. We would constantly get lunch together. It wasn't necessarily talking about the projects. We could be talking about our lives outside. Nathan just had a baby not a year ago, so sometimes he would come in and look knackered. So I'd say, `Are you all right?` Yeah, he was up all night. Yeah, and you get him coffee. So yeah, it was really nice. It was like a family unit, which was nice. Interestingly enough, I was talking to Nathan about this the other day, we just had a review on this project. I was asking about roles and if IDEO projects always had people who have specific roles. Like, they have a project leader but beyond that. N was like, `HF.` And I was [inaudible 00:27:21]. So we stuck to those three core ... Those with [inaudible 00:27:24]. Around that, then we overlapped and would lead certain things and not others and help out in different areas and facilitate bits. But the core competency always remained the same. So you knew ultimately, you were always responsible. Interestingly [inaudible 00:27:46], that occurs on every project, I've been told. I don't know, but it's just something we were discussing in the review at the end of [inaudible 00:27:54]. So I think that's quite important in terms of interpersonal relationships with each person having a specific ... Even if it's just 50% of the time, you know your actual core role, and out of that you can help develop [inaudible 00:28:13]. other day, we just had a review on this project. I was asking about roles and if IDEO projects always had people who have specific roles. Like, they have a project leader but beyond that. N was like, `HF.` And I was [inaudible 00:27:21].

Even if it's just 50% of the time, you know your actual core role, and out of that you can help develop [inaudible 00:28:13]. Yeah, to help them create an innovation capability for themselves. And for me, it obviously went very well, mainly because one of the CEOs originally ... The word innovation was something that just meant that he was gonna waste a lot of money and was a complete waste of time. [inaudible 00:14:06] sold to him at the end and they loved it and they've technically signed this thing off, and it's moving forwards to actually become ... We created the skeleton, as it were, and the path for them to follow. The word innovation was something that just meant that he was gonna waste a lot of money and was a complete waste of time. [inaudible 00:14:06] sold to him at the end and they loved it and they've technically signed this thing off, and it's moving forwards to actually become ... We created the skeleton, as it were, and the path for them to follow. I think by putting across what could possibly be a bite-size chunks of very logical, simple, elements to the whole structure of the innovation capability. A part of our thinking was to develop very visually orientated frameworks that were easy to understand. This is where we are, this is where we want to be, this is how we're gonna get you there. These are the elements of your organization, they will tie in this way, they fit together and they overlap here, this is what develops out of it, which is the culture. It just fit. For me as well, I use ... As the communications designer and the person who came in last, I use myself as the lowest common denominator. If I didn't get it, then it wasn't right. Because if I couldn't get it, and I'm not the smartest man in the world and I'm not the stupidest man in the world, it's kind of like, okay, if this doesn't make any sense to me, then ... Yeah. It was great because they come with a business [inaudible 00:15:29]. They might say something that didn't quite ... I wouldn't understand because it might be too business orientated, and so we just accompanied that sort of title with a little sort of explanation that made sense to me. So if you were sitting in Generali and you read and understand because maybe you're Italian and you've not heard that phrase before, the little explanation [inaudible 00:15:50] make you feel comfortable, like okay, I understand what it is. I think, in the presentation and in all the communications we did, that was kind of key throughout. So I think that's possibly why it worked. And you change and you rapidly prototype constantly. Which is great and actually a quite interesting way of working. More like how I would normally work actually, how I had worked outside of IDEO. Rapid designs, presenting, and then changing iterations. PROJECT ID And you change and you rapidly prototype constantly. Which is great and actually a quite interesting way of working.

    "text": "In terms of IDEO, my only project ... It still went very well in terms of the client, but in terms of personal spending two 60 hours weeks working til eight o'clock in the morning, on your birthday. Not ideal. So it's a very personal not so well. I came back from holiday and was relaunched immediately onto this project, and arrived and it's like, `We've got to do this in this amount of time.` You're like, `Fuck.` You know, when you sort of go, `Oh, shit. Shit.` And then I spent the next, what, 11, 12 days working between 14 and 22 hours a day. So by the end of that, I was like. No clue. Because I hadn't been a part of the 15 weeks beforehand, I don't really know what's been going on. You can guess, I can surmise, which I know [inaudible 00:29:28], but it's kinda like it shouldn't be like that. I don't understand why it has to be like that. Unless the brief has changed, and there's a lot more to do in the same amount of time, then yeah I can understand why. But then theoretically [inaudible 00:29:48] points if the brief has changed, then IDEO can ask for more money, and therefore resource more people. But the resourcing didn't really change. It's kind of I was just brought in to help. And I even had to get a third freelancer to help me. I'm not sure the margins but you can see that we probably wasted money, which is a shame because it was a really good project and a really good outcome. So I suppose then you have to balance that. From London to Shanghai, obviously. And the States. So you had these different phases being in different areas of the company. Because that, you've got lots of different people and stakeholders who suddenly need to be shown something. It's like ... Some of that to me is not the best management of understanding in the very beginning that there were these people all sat on the committee that they see every month or easy simple things, rather than waiting right to the end [inaudible 00:33:55] no, this. And you go, `Fuck.` Well, it's more in terms of, from my perspective, I was creating communications and the production side of creating communications, it takes too long for you to bring someone in and say, `Can we change all of this?` It's actually, `No, you can't` should be the answer. It's something they're really trying to adjust to. Obviously the work that we were creating was very much a part of that journey for them. And part of my understanding now is to try and learn more and understand how that client actually really thinks, because currently I don't read enough of a grasp of that side of thing. I don't really know, to be honest. From what my understanding is that they were very ... The Chinese culture is a thing of sort of change from engineering them to becoming a brand is a huge [inaudible 00:34:52]. It's something they're really trying to adjust to. Obviously the work that we were creating was very much a part of that journey for them. And part of my understanding now is to try and learn more and understand how that client actually really thinks, because currently I don't read enough of a grasp of that side of thing. IDEO is one of my sort of initial Shanghai requirements to get very much involved in the understanding of how these sorts of clients are thinking and where they see themselves. How they interact with something like IDEO. Because from my understanding it's completely different. You have to be very careful about somebody with their associates and stuff, and not lose face. All these sort of different nuanced barriers that I have to be very careful of, that I wouldn't have in the Western culture. I think it's probably not too dissimilar to Western ... When we were describing earlier over the brief. People do that. People write something down and then you do something and then you show them, and they're `That's not what I wanted.` It takes them to see something for them to be able to suddenly make a decision. Sometimes the content, especially [inaudible 00:39:07] changing, evolving right up to the 11th hour, and so to produce a deliverable of some description that explains to whoever, to whichever type of audience is almost ... Sometimes it's very difficult to not do it in a sensible time frame. It has to be really [inaudible 00:39:29] because the production of these things and sitting on a Macintosh and getting three designers to `All right. We need to find these images and pull this together.` It takes a long while. It doesn't happen quickly and I think sometimes that we either over deliver and make things look really beautiful, and we maybe not necessarily need to because these are intermediate stages of the project. And I'm beginning to understand that. Sort of going this is phase four and there's another two phases, so actually what we can do is make a really nice deliverable but it doesn't mean it has to be the [inaudible 00:40:09] deliverable that, say for instance, we just did for Generali or these other elements that we produced. It can be a sort of prototype that can still look very lovely, just doesn't have to be as polished or as finished as sometimes you come into something, `Oh, right. We're gonna make this.` Take too long and you don't need to because it's depending on the phase of how we're talking to the client. I perceive fairly well. I think for this client, interestingly enough, because they had three or four phases with different areas of IDEO, I think what started to happen is we need to have almost one point of contact, which is gonna be Kelly and a couple of others in Shanghai who were now integrated with TCL full time, and then wherever the work goes, which should be now Shanghai because we're setting up the facilities, better do it there. With myself and a few others going over. We should have one coherent voice over and I think what's happened before, they're getting a bit touchy in terms of, we're talking to them and now we're talking to you. Now we're talking to you. And that's fair enough. That's understandable. In their eyes, IDEO is one thing and suddenly you have all these different people. So I think that's been an interesting learning curve for me to change that, and I think they are about to. Yeah, great. Francis is great. He's a very calm, very relaxed man. No, we get on really well, so that was fun. I think I'm not the sort of person who judges or complains at the time of doing stuff. We'll have the review and I'll sit down and say what I said to you today, which is we shouldn't be doing that. Why were we doing that? Try and understand it. It's not really anybody's fault, generally. Generally these things just occur. I have no idea what happened in the first 15 weeks. You can surmise, people have said things. Yeah, Ross and Amy are the communications guys. We had been working on the project full time, and so we had our room of tranquility, we call. The team is obviously split off into different areas, so we had the ID guys working on the ID stuff, and the communication guys working on their stuff. Which I suppose is working for them. If it was me, I would try and pull everyone back together, but that's just me. But yeah, we had a room of tranquility, so it was very nice. Playing radio four and dealing picks at the time. So it's a very personal not so well. I came back from holiday and was relaunched immediately onto this project, and arrived and it's like, `We've got to do this in this amount of time.` You're like, `Fuck.` You know, when you sort of go, `Oh, shit. Shit.` But the resourcing didn't really change. It's kind of I was just brought in to help. And I even had to get a third freelancer to help me. I But the resourcing didn't really change. It's kind of I was just brought in to help. And I even had to get a third freelancer to help me. Well, see I'm very much of the [inaudible 00:30:46] where you shouldn't be working 22 hours a day. If you do one, fine. Potentially. You then have to come in the next day and work another 12 hours? It's just wrong. It's not ... You're not ... You can't function properly. You can't make decent and clear decisions. Some of that to me is not the best management of understanding in the very beginning that there were these people all sat on the committee that they see every month or easy simple things, rather than waiting right to the end [inaudible 00:33:55] no, this. And you go, `Fuck.` You have to be very careful about somebody with their associates and stuff, and not lose face. All these sort of different nuanced barriers that I have to be very careful of, that I wouldn't have in the Western culture. Potentially it's management all understanding again of how long it's gonna take you to create the different elements that you need to create at the end. No, I think just because IDEO allows you to have freedom, it also allows you to then take too long. There's a sort of balance to be had between my outside experience, which is being chained to the desk and told this is how long you've got and get on with it. To this where you almost have ultimate freedom to be anywhere, go off anywhere and do and think and think and think and think. If you take too long, you suddenly run out of time. I'm always thinking, `Oh Christ, I've only got two weeks left to do it. I'm not sure whether it's that simple but it feels like it. It has to be really [inaudible 00:39:29] because the production of these things and sitting on a Macintosh and getting three designers to `All right. We need to find these images and pull this together.` Very much the Chinese orientated ... One of the ... Selena came over from Shanghai.

    "text": "I think it was positive for me, but I don't know, I know that in parts it was difficult for team members and stuff, but I think that the overall outcome was good. In terms of content. Yeah. I mean, there's things that we've done before, but this sort of project as a whole. There's bits of it that we've done before, but the project as a whole was kind of new so it was challenging for all of us to sort of push our knowledge and our expertise. Nathan was sort of the project manager and he knew what things I'd like to try or what my strengths were or where I needed to push myself. If I wouldn't be so good about putting myself forward for something, he'd try, and push me or help me to achieve things personally as well as thinking about what IDEO gets out it. He was thinking about what we individually get out of it as well. I think they're some of the reasons it was a success. I would think that was more a success in terms of personally. So, I started at IDEO working in a different, sort of ... I was working in support and that was probably the project where I said, I probably think of this as a success because personally I felt like it was a project where I really ... It changed my role, so I started doing more of the human factors type work on that project, and I worked really closely with the human factors team and with the clients so it sort of was a test of our skills and a test of working with a client that closely. We're sort of living with them for like a few days of every week. Yeah, I think on that project as well, some of the clients had some personal transformations of they really feel like they were affected by working with us and learning from us and maybe not so much that we've changed the NHS, but we've had an impact on people, individual people and they sort of feel like they have learned a lot from working with us. So that's why I think it was successful. We were working with the innovation and improvement agency from the NHS and they'd gone from 1,000 people to 40 people. It was kind of a stressful time for them, they were all reapplying for their jobs, but yeah, we sort of managed to hang onto our team Then we did a project in hospitals looking at how they could use a design and innovation approach on one of their high priority areas, which is around infectious diseases. Particularly this one called C. Diff., I don't know if you've heard of it. So we were sort of looking at how ... We did lots of observations in hospitals and a couple of hospitals in Birmingham. Probably like two key decisions makers or three key decision makers, but then there were lots of stakeholders who sort of would've influenced it along the way, but yeah. Then, you know, working with the NHS as well because it's a government department. They have so many, sort of, above the client, there's so many people that go right up to say, the prime minister or whatever, that influences public policy with regard to healthcare. But relation to the project, at least two key decision makers, but I know there were other people involved as well. Because I think once a project starts, you know, we have relative autonomy on a project, but I think at a certain stage everybody on the team makes decisions, you know, different things and a lot of the time we were together, we try to be quite collaborative and make decisions as a team, but there's certain points where you gotta make some decisions on your own, but I think everybody would've been involved in decision making though as well. . They're kind of, I think would make, in some senses, make an excuse of like, `This is government agency, we're slow moving, it's public policy. We've gotta follow all these rules.` They probably would've made excuses as to why they didn't want to do things because of certain reasons or because they're a government agency. I think probably by the end, they probably would be a bit more ... because they've done it once, they'd probably be a bit more ... if we did another project with them, they might be a bit more risk accept- ... You know, they might be more willing to take some more risks. Probably the most stressful thing with regard to time and budget was the fact that the hospital they picked was in Birmingham and I think in retrospect, if we had our time over we would've definitely pushed back and say, `I thought we wanted a hospital in London.` Just because the clients coming along with us a lot of the time, but we were doing most of the work here at IDEO and not all the team members would go. Sometimes it would be just some of us who would go and that really put a lot of stress on the team, so I think in retrospect, we would've pushed back on location cause that was probably the biggest ... You know, that added in to our time and our budget.  think we still delivered to the best of our ability given the time and budget, but I think that was the biggest factor that could've influenced what we delivered at the end of the day Oh, yeah, so they selected these two hospitals which had sort of bad reputations in regard to this infectious disease or infectious diseases in general. So we went and literally myself and a colleague case say in wards trying to look inconspicuous, which is kind of difficult. If they see anybody, because they get so many people from the department of health coming, doing different audits and different surveys and checking up on them, it was very hard to gain their trust and to just let them know that we weren't trying to get any of them sacked or to do a report on them or that we weren't spying on them. So we did lots of sitting around in hospitals, feeling in the way. We also held ... Some of my colleagues interviewed lots of different stakeholders so getting away from the normal talking to nurses and doctors and consultants, which we did as well, and we also spoke to some of the porters that worked in the hospital. I know one guy sort of started breaking down and crying in one of interviews and said, `You know, I've worked her for 30 years and this is the first time anyone's asked me what I think.` He was really great, he became sort of one of our poster children for the project. His stories were kind of famous, it was like Ted the porter or something.

His stories were kind of famous, it was like Ted the porter or something. So spoke to lots of different people. We held a workshop where some of the people came to tell their stories and to help us to try, and design new ideas. What else did we do? Did other sort of research. Yeah. I think that was. I don't know if we did anything sort of [inaudible 00:24:23] or ... Yeah, I think that was kind of it really. It was mainly sort of immersing yourselves in the environment to try, and understand what it was like because I guess we sort of realized quite early on that other people who work in healthcare, you've got to be a special type of person to do the job. Especially some of the, what they call domestics who are like nurses aids. They have a really tough job. I mean, you know, it's not pretty, and they don't get paid much, and they've gotta do a pretty hardcore job. Nobody wants to have dirty hospital or to do things that are gonna put the patient at risk, but there's just sometimes there's just things that are in their way that ... I mean the reality is, they can only do what they have time for. Their budgets been cut or the hospital doesn't provide uniforms so they're wearing the uniform home or they're wearing their own clothes. So it was kind of realizing ... It was just immersing ourselves in that so that we could actually understand what the reality is for them on a day to day basis. I don't think you really understand unless you've walked a mile in their shoes as it were so I think we just tried to understand what the reality was on the ground rather than, you know, they have lots of reports from the department of health about what the policy is regarding infectious diseases and what you should do. It was just to understand what it's actually like in reality.  So it was kind of realizing ... It was just immersing ourselves in that so that we could actually understand what the reality is for them on a day to day basis. I don't think you really understand unless you've walked a mile in their shoes as it were so I think we just tried to understand what the reality was on the ground rather than, you know, they have lots of reports from the department of health about what the policy is regarding infectious diseases and what you should do. It was just to understand what it's actually like in reality. . Going up and down to Birmingham a lot. Because it's only like ... I know a lot people will do this on a day to day basis, but it's like two hours on the train, but you know, say for example it's like three hours commuting. But hanging out in hospitals and sort of really doing the immersion helped to strengthen the relationship and I think it just took a bit of time for those bonds to form. But I think when you're ... I think you find it here when you travel with your colleagues, that's when you really get to know them, that's when you sort of ... You know, it's like, I don't think you really know some- ... Well it's the best opportunity to get to know somebody really well is when you travel with them so I think when we were doing the observations and stuff, that was when we really sort of got to know them and I think by the end of it, you would say that some of them were definitely friends more than ... We built sort of a personal bond with them as well. But I know at certain points, there was times when they were trying to push back on certain things and I know definitely like for example the choice of hospital was a contentious issue and it was just sort of trying to convey to them that, yes it's more convenient for us have a hospital in London, but I think it will impact positively on the outcome of the whole project. So I know that was a contentious issue at the start, but I think overall the relationship was good and I think definitely the important moments during the project that were a bit contentious, but overall at the end I think the relationship was good. So I know that was a contentious issue at the start, but I think overall the relationship was good and I think definitely the important moments during the project that were a bit contentious, but overall at the end I think the relationship was good. I think it was just, you know, definitely it was hard when we were sort of in different locations so I think when we came together and we just sort of listening to what their concerns were because I suppose some of the time doing things for them, like for example, doing observations in hospitals, that's the first time they'd ever done anything like that so it's just being understanding of the fact that, you know, the agency they're working for they've just gone from 1,000 people to 40. Even some of the people we were working with were reapplying for their jobs whilst they were working with us. So it's kind of having a bit of understanding that they're going through a tough time, they don't know if they're gonna have a job next week so we just have to be really understanding of that fact.

So it's kind of having a bit of understanding that they're going through a tough time, they don't know if they're gonna have a job next week so we just have to be really understanding of that fact. They were all going through stressful time, they've seen hundreds of their colleagues being made redundant so we had to just ... When they had an issue we had to just understand that for them, doing something that we think is normal, going out and doing observations or interviewing people was a big stretch for them. We just had to talk it through. This is their concerns and try, and find a way to meet in the middle. they've just gone from 1,000 people to 40.

We just had to talk it through. This is their concerns and try, and find a way to meet in the middle. So, I knew her really, really well so again, it was a case of it was like I was working with a friend as well. Because I'd worked with her on loads of projects it makes it that much easier because I sort of knew her quite well and again, that was earlier on in my time here so she would try, and ... I'm not the most confident so she would be trying to push me towards, you know, if there were things that I could try that were new, she would be pushing me to do that, so that was good. I think it makes it easier in some ways because so much of our knowledge and experience is tied up in peoples hands so all the knowledge resides with people. So it's if you're working with the same people, you have that same sort of bank of knowledge and you can call upon ... I guess there's something to be said for changing project teams because then the knowledge gets dispersed and you sort of like ... You know, cause we're really bad at knowledge sharing. Yeah. So sometimes you only hear about something through ... You would only hear about something through a person so like if you do a really good presentation or something that's really usable again, unless you go and work on another project team, people won't hear about it. But there's something to be said from a personal point of view, I find working with people that I know, both good and bad, in that they know me quite well personally and they know my skills and what things I'm good and what things I'd like to work on. I guess, from a personal development point of view, they can help you to achieve things like that. I guess it makes the startup phase a bit quicker in that you know this person, you know their working style. Possibly. I mean ... So I have one example of bad [inaudible 00:32:25] and I haven't really worked with those people again. I suppose it would, but ... I suppose it depends on what you feel ... what caused the previous situation to be bad. If it was a personal thing or if it was a situation or if it was the project or if it was the client or I don't know, a whole bunch of factors, rather than the person. I think the thing I would find most difficult was if it was somebody I didn't get along with personally. I think other things you can kind of overcome whereas if it's personal, personal is a thing that might be more difficult.  You know, there was at the hospital, there was a guy who was head of infection control and he was not a key member of our team, but we would've gone to meet with him a few times and he came to our workshop and stuff. He was very negative so I guess, after every time we'd meet with him, we'd sort of all get together and comfort each other because he was just so negative and would just shut everything down. But I think it strengthens your bonds with people when you come through tough times. I think that project, there was definitely moments where it was tough, but when you come out of it, it feels like, you know ... There was emails like ages after when we realized something had been launched or I can't remember. But we still feel like we have a bond having been through the experience of this project. Yeah, they were good. So we had one person who actually came over from the states to work on it and then ... So I suppose it was difficult for her in that she was away from home and things and spending her time in UK traveling up to dirty hospitals in Birmingham. Probably not the best way to ... But I think probably, you know, there were other tough moments and it strengthens your relationships with people when you have those sort of tough moments, when you come through them.

If I wouldn't be so good about putting myself forward for something, he'd try, and push me or help me to achieve things personally as well as thinking about what IDEO gets out it. He was thinking about what we individually get out of it as well. I think they're some of the reasons it was a success. Particularly this one called C. Diff., I don't know if you've heard of it. So we were sort of looking at how ... We did lots of observations in hospitals and a couple of hospitals in Birmingham. I think they probably would've said that their risk tolerance was a bit higher than their other colleagues because it's a sensitive area in healthcare. I know even trying to do observations, it took us a long time to sort of set that up because it's working in health care, so we can't just do our normal go in, take lots of photos nd I think in retrospect, if we had our time over we would've definitely pushed back and say, `I thought we wanted a hospital in London.` Just because the clients coming along with us a lot of the time, You know, I've worked her for 30 years and this is the first time anyone's asked me what I think.` He was really great, he became sort of one of our poster children for the project.

    "text": "Like, I only will be on one or two projects throughout. They find my resources really good to impact and make impacts in projects around. Instead of just being continuous in one, which is fine. I don't mind doing. But, in IDEO we have this thing about flexibility, content, and leadership. Three things you should have or something. Those three. So I'm still learning this all. And so my content is a product designer. That's your main, core aspect of yourself. But, have you heard about the T designer in IDEO, did they talk about that? It was a Chinese twenty-seven, twenty-six year old guy, it was his first project management, it was his first, first project lead, and we all got to do our own jobs to be able to make the target. The team on that was three really young guys, but say twenty-six and twenty-three. We just followed who we were, and there wasn't really a sense of hierarchy, there was no one, even the project leader wasn't the oldest guy. It was a Chinese twenty-seven, twenty-six year old guy, it was his first project management, it was his first, first project lead, and we all got to do our own jobs to be able to make the target. So there was no one ever saying, do this, do this. Sometimes you need that in a really big projects, to get these things to the level, you have to meet these targets. But what we did, we only took our own world, you know? And did what we needed to do. There was no hierarchy, it was just interesting. I've never worked like that before. And at times I kind of needed someone to say, can you do this, do that for me. But, because I'm doing it, but it also in a way let me think and do my own things, and so it was cool. We came out with successful projects issued. No, we came out with good ideas, really good ideas without...we put it up on day one, which is a really big thing in IDEO. If it doesn't fit the user's foot, you know, it doesn't matter how well you can draw something or cast something up, or look great on a computer screen. If it doesn't fit the person's fit, comes to be doesn't stay on the person's foot, then there's no point, no one's gonna wanna buy it. The reason I say successful is that we got feet. We got people's feet and built around it. And it was a really different way of doing it. That's why I say successful. They were pretty risky. They wanted us to push out. They didn't want us to see... you kinda look at it like, we were designing a flip flop, you know? It's not gonna, it's a flip flop. You can't put batteries in it and make it fly. It's still gonna be impractical. I mean, those design principles are of simplicity, copy high-tech, you know? We couldn't go stupid about it, we couldn't make it out of gold or anything. Yeah, time was good, time was fine. It was pretty hectic, but you know, you're working maybe one or twice a week until eight, but normally finish at six, six thirty. It was not a stressful project in that time scope. Budget, there was never really a budget, it was a bit clad. No, they knew they needed help and they came to us. So they really, I think they knew [inaudible 00:29:59]. It's all coming out. And the project leader got us the job. Yeah, she's great. We get along really well. WE both have the same sort of industrial design background. At the time, as I said, I wasn't full time, so I was off trying to get a job. I was very keen, and eager, and immature, and everything that a graduate is. And it paid off, and we built friendship, and bonded, and she probably got us our jobs in IDEO. That's really, out different. [inaudible 00:30:54] Projects being full-time. It's really listening to projects leaders, more than anything, and having communication with it. I can't stress the communication is great. Just always talking to each other, never just sit there and think, fuck, fuck, fuck. You know, fuck! You can't do that, just say, just be honest and say, I can't do this. That comes actually to me because, I don't know, but I think a lot of people would struggle to ask for help. It's as if it's a weakness. I don't think it's a weakness, and it can't be a weakness at IDEO, cause it's such a multi-disciplinary place. As much as people say things about that, we're multi-disciplinary and stuff, yeah. Just brings to mind, whoever. For me, that doesn't mean much to me, but the point is that we can all talk to each other, and that's where I find the most inspiring part of it. It's not that we're all different, but if you can't all talk to each other, then there's no point. I mean, I'm really good at something, and he's really good at something. And if we can't bump and talk, there's no point. And that's where the team comes back in, you gotta be able to talk to each other. Yeah, it was cool. It was cool cause, as I said, it was almost five product designers. Two of which, myself included, weren't full time. So we were like, little puppies, trying to work, work, work. And then there was two, middle age, and one senior, and then our design director as well. Yeah, we all got a long really well. It was a good balance throughout the team, you know? There's always someone to look up to. They couldn't really ask me questions, one was a design director. But I think she really needed to in that project. Cause she could have gone higher, the creative director, but, you know I had, the middle of the guys to talk to, and I could do the work also, get the senior also, get the design director, so it was all about communication for all of us, and we all got a long really well. We're all very different people, so. There was a Welshman, Englishman, Spaniard, Japanese, Canadian. It was cool. It's really listening to projects leaders, more than anything, and having communication with it. I can't stress the communication is great. o we were like, little puppies, trying to work, work, work. And then there was two, middle age, and one senior, and then our design director as well. Yeah, we all got a long really well. so it was all about communication for all of us, and we all got a long really well. So, yeah, the idea of a stem, but you can also broaden out to these other stems. And that's one of my main stance as a designer, is that I can help in lots of other things. Which means I'm really good at the flexible side of it.  I know a good project I did well was the Ikea project. I think everyone in the IDEO team are decision makers. We'll all state our opinion, and build. We'd never bring, there might be a bit of negativity, about it's impossible to make or something like that, but- It's not gonna, it's a flip flop. You can't put batteries in it and make it fly. It's still gonna be impractical. I mean, those design principles are of simplicity, copy high-tech, you know? We couldn't go stupid about it, we couldn't make it out of gold or anything. But that was one of the first things we told them, we said, we believe from what your first designer fit, we can those, that brand of whatever that shouts, and make other arrange of flip flops that still talk about that. Still have the same values, but have different aspect, but still are Havaiianas, and not Birkenstocks, you know? Which is cool. I mean, we tend to over deliver a lot on an idea. It's kind of silly, cause we do a lot of work, but then it's all about making [inaudible 00:27:33] use them again, sort of thing. They just photographed it, and came back and presented it to us. I've never, I've always done projects where, the scale of it is I can see it. And this was one of the first projects where, I wasn't on the team to start, but then they came back and said, hey this is what we found. And it was just so inspiring, and then being there, but the stories they could tell was instantly, you know, my head was going ding-ding-ding-ding. Ideas. It was just great.",

    "text": "Okay. Well, a project that went really well in terms of the results and...that's really hard for me to say something went bad, cause I'm still a junior, and everything seems to be going so well, you know? I'm doing an M.A. video, I came straight from a B.A., didn't do an M.A. Basically I could be doing an M.A. now, but instead of by day, learning everything here, sharing so much knowledge with some of the best designers in the world. So for me to say that something's gone negatively, I can't really think much. If I'm being really picky, it is one of the strongest projects in the year has gone through. And I enjoyed it a lot. But it didn't really devote much of my product design side of it, that's what I'm trying to do at the moment. Everyone knows I'm very flexible, and leadership will come as I stay here longer, but you kind of forget, some people kind of forget that I'm actually a product designer. One of the big things I'm trying to do is, like I said, reinstate that sort of thing. But on a project, I recently read there was no product designer, but they knew I could aid the head graphic designer, cause I can develop graphics. And they know cause I'm a junior that I could get things done, sort out, you know, organize things. In the negative, in a way that's kind of a negative thing for me. It progressed me again, in the flexibility side of things, but didn't really progress me in the content side of it, my product design side of it. So, in a way, that's kind of negative, but...when there's a negative, there's always properly a positive.  One of the first projects is on, where I still had that sort of that immature dude, and didn't know exactly how IDEO process worked. It felt a bit down, and maybe we all designed some stuff, and maybe there's one idea that I came up with, and I think it didn't go through or connect with everyone, and I felt disappointed. One of the first projects is on, where I still had that sort of that immature dude, and didn't know exactly how IDEO process worked. It felt a bit down, and maybe we all designed some stuff, and maybe there's one idea that I came up with, and I think it didn't go through or connect with everyone, and I felt disappointed. As long as it's backed up, we probably could have gone out there, but we didn't find much say that we should do something risky. There's no point, you gotta make people happy. Yeah, it was perfect. We did a work-life balance thing, so it was all about leaving...start at nine-thirty, lunch, little bit of fun during the day, and then finishing at six. It was about two days a week, really. But previously they were there three to four days a week, I think. So, yeah, they'd come over, we'd give them stuff to do, and work with us, and that's where we died off, to the point that we were just getting stuff ready to go out in the field test. But they were working along us while it was all happening. Yeah, she's great. I think it was also her first project lead, and because it was like a organizational project really, of getting these thing out to field test, there wasn't much more than, the client was already on board. There wasn't much client looking after and pampering, saying that was why they gave it to her, I think. She's a good organizer, and she got it all done, and we made a great margin. But yeah, we get on great now, cause she felt bad sort of for bringing me on the project, cause there's no product design to be done, or any design. But she knew that I could get things done, and I was the sort of person that could help her on that project. So she asked, she kind of came up and said, do you mind working on this project for a second, and I said, hey it's cool, that'll help me in my flexibility side of things. Show services I can dabble in that sort of things. So it's cool. But yeah, we're cool now. Yeah, she's great. I think it was also her first project lead, and because it was like a organizational project really, of getting these thing out to field test, there wasn't much more than, the client was already on board. There wasn't much client looking after and pampering, saying that was why they gave it to her, I think. She's a good organizer, and she got it all done, and we made a great margin. Yeah, really good. All of us supposedly had been there under year. Been the idea, well around a year, under a year. So, we're all quite, not naïve, but still quite junior. They're not that. Two of them and the project leader, they're not, they're all middle age, seniors. But I was the most junior. We're all still quite young in the IDEO terms. It felt a bit down, and maybe we all designed some stuff, and maybe there's one idea that I came up with, and I think it didn't go through or connect with everyone, and I felt disappointed. But Alan said, how are we gonna get inspired. It was all about field testing, the content that was already there. Since you call people I never worked with, but you get to know them, you get to work with them, and you bond relationships so quickly though. So, we're all quite, not naïve, but still quite junior. They're not that. Two of them and the project leader, they're not, they're all middle age, seniors. But I was the most junior. We're all still quite young in the IDEO terms.",

Just you know, I mean, I'm a project manager and just one of the big things that I think, I mean that I think I'm always thinking about is good communication and communicating with the client and making sure you understand their point of view. You try your hardest to, understand their goals; then that's what makes a project go well really. Because then I can relay that back to the team and make sure that work in the direction that we are going in is not only creative, and new, and all them things that design should be like, and cool, and whatever. But it is also like aligning yourself very much with the business sort of goal and making the brief at the end of the day. I mean the content, the content has got a lot to do with it, whether you think the projects gone well or not and getting all of those elements together, the best team who understand the content before they even start the project or have some sort of background in the content. You know its kind of scary when you, a lot of the time we do projects here where teams here have not done much work in that content area and you feel fairly out of depth and its quite hard to understand whether you're doing well or not, because you are always in this kind of fog of like are we doing well or not, you know, because we have never done it before. And if you've never done something before, it's a very stressful situation to be in, like, and I try to avoid that as much as possible. But you know, most of my projects are you know, pretty standard industry design, software design that kind of stuff, design strategy stuff, where I am pretty experienced in that side of things. So that is one of the big factors that makes a project go well, whether you're experienced or not. I mean, the clients the big thing really, if the client is an arse, you can have a nightmare. There are only two ways about it. Because we all have little specialties, little kind of you know, [inaudible 00:11:13] whose been on my team is like a brilliant instructions guy, he's great visual interaction design. Whereas there are other interaction designers who are better at you know, doing things, like I don't know, different types of interaction design. So you've got to kind of say, “what kind of project is this? What kinds of demands is going to make [inaudible 00:11:33]”. You know are we designing -- I've just designed a remote control for televisions so you make sure you get an industrial designer who knows about devices, not an industry designer whose might have been doing food and beverage packaging for the last 3 year or somethings, you know what I mean. Or mobile, you know someone who has done mobile phones extensively. So that team, getting that team things started out; but then, because we are on office, there are a whole bunch of projects going around at the same time; its about trying, that's hard because people get resourced onto the projects at the time of signing. So if you are trying to get a project team together and you haven't gotten a signature for a contract, then your best interaction designer goes to that team over there; then you, you know. I'm in the raw. Everyone at Ideal is great, I'm not saying that we have got shit designers, cause we haven't; but there are people who are suited to do things better, so you might end up with a team that is not perfect for the content area, so that's what happens. Resources, just a fucking nightmare, its just a nightmare scenario resourcing. I don't know, we have gotten so many systems in this office over the last ten years, over resourcing and again it's about, there is no one way to do this; it's about blood and tears. Its like people sitting in the room, sketching people out and fighting over resourcing. I've been in meetings where you know, people are getting upset about like who is on what project. And its really tricky because I don't know what the answer is to it really. Resourcing is such a messy business. So one good thing is to just a really nice backup of freelancers, trusted, tried and tested freelancers that we know are going to deliver; and we've used quite a few of them on my projects, cause you know, you can't do it without -- I mean the client often says like, can we translate this document to whatever, like great and you've got to do it overnight. There is nobody in the office that is going to do that for you, and you've just got to make sure that you have people so the networks are really important. And it was a really nice project in the sense that it was what we call a fair-zero; so it was like, go out in the world and find out what peoples navigational needs are. And then again, the team was great, we had a really great team. We went all over the world, it was fucking great, I remember driving down like, we did, it is a navigation device, we hired shit loads of cars and we stuck navigation devices in our wind screens and we drove across America and stuff, and it was just unbelievable. We drove from, right down the west coast of America in a ford mustang; and that's pretty cool.   And then we met all these great people, these users, which was really inspiring. And then the great, the other great, some of the great outcomes of that was that the company then really kind of embedded our process and our user sort of centered language in a way into their marketer and it not only, it didn't just make the device; you know it started talking about the, it started marketing. I mean this is a great example of like how our user insights will draw their marketing, because their user insights; because now their marketing says “We went out to see users and users said blah blah blah, and users said this, because users wanted that”. And its just really direct from the horses mouth; users wanted this, we've designed it. Most companies don't really do that honest marketing approach, they just talk bullshit so that was nice. (Phone rings) Oh shit. The biggest reason why they have gone well is because we've managed to get the best team together; so that has a big influence on how the project goes, just getting the right people. And that is not easy. Contemporary art just asks more questions in a way, whereas the work we do shuts down questions and answers questions; it does, you can ask more questions, but the goal of our work is to ask more questions and to have a final thing, And then again, the team was great, we had a really great team. And then we met all these great people, these users, which was really inspiring. And then the great, the other great, some of the great outcomes of that was that the company then really kind of embedded our process and our user sort of centered language in a way into their marketer and it not only, it I mean this is a great example of like how our user insights will draw their marketing, because their user insights; because now their marketing says “We went out to see users and users said blah blah blah, and users said this, because users wanted that”.

    "text": "It's just a very good, big, big project to get your teeth into. And I learned a lot as well, so learned good. But not too much learning, cause that's not smart. On the client's side, it's usually someone who's my mirror in a way, like their project manager. And then, I don't know, it depends on the organization. These plans look like it's just a mess, and the latest client, the current client, is just a mess. We've got about twenty CEOs and CTOs that all have something to say and all have some decision to make. It's just a fuckin' nightmare. It makes the project a nightmare because everything takes five times as long. So, I don't know, there's about ten people who have a say in what happens, which is a pain. But listen, there, I know there's like, nobody will like decision-maker [inaudible 00:03:46], so some guy at the top will say something all filled with rude, so like, someone who's a spokesperson to communicate that decision. It's rare that I'll be making some sort of communication with the main guy at my tack. It wouldn't happen. But his decisions come through the team. Yeah. We're usually dealing with... it depends on the company. I mean, Navman and SKT, well Navman's a good example because Navman only do... the only people we were working with was the in-car device department, if you want to call it `department`. But, so they're the only people we're dealing with. We're not talking to the CEO of Navman, the actual whole company, because they're dealing with [inaudible 00:04:51] to do all sorts of different types of nav-piece devices. No, they're just sort of risk-averse. And it pisses me off, cause they're [inaudible 00:05:53] right? They gave us half a million pounds, right? And they go, right, we want the best this, the most innovative this, and no, we want... And they've obviously got massive aspirations, but then [inaudible 00:06:06] showing something, right. The feasibility of films come on, and they're just like, bang all the ideas. [inaudible 00:06:10]. And they go oh, we can't do that. So, it's well, don't do that, no, it doesn't make any money. Oh, can't do that, people won't like it. This is like project-miser, this is what the project's like. Yeah, they always do. It always changes. I don't even know how to answer. The brief changes so many times, it's kind of unbelievable. Especially with Asian clients, they're just, you show them something, and dunno, it changes. You're always having this argument, saying look, this high that I'm dealing with now, the miracle [crosstalk 00:08:19] is like, this isn't part of the statement of work, it's old-school, we're not doing it. Time's never the problem, but yeah, I guess so. I mean, you do what you can with the time at the end of the day. It's always tight, it's always very tight, yeah, it's all very tight. Some of these old designers, right, is that they're never satisfied. So we're all completely anal, and you polish diamonds forever, and it's never shiny enough. Do you know what I mean? And you're always unsatisfied with it. So, we're in this constant state of fuckin' miserableness because nothing's ever good enough for us, and you always wanna do better, and you always try to do it better, so you always feel like you don't have enough time and enough money to do the job. So, but I think that's one of my roles, I think, as the project manager, to just go look guys, you've fuckin' done enough. Send it, cause it's down in the little things, there's nothing left. Clearly, there's people that you can't get on with sometimes, but there's a professional air about. It all has to be professional. But there's plenty of times when we've done lots of things together in Taiwan in the middle of the night, getting cobbling drunk together. So yeah, good. Why don't we connect? Just cultural, I mean. It's just very difficult [crosstalk 00:12:29], especially in Korea, where it's very hierarchical, and everybody looks the same. You go over there and like you design everyone. Nobody has an opinion in Korea, you have to be very senior before you have an opinion. Otherwise, people are very scared of being criticized for their opinion, so they don't say anything. You don't have an opinion, cause you might get criticized. And they don't wear anything different, or they don't look different. So that's quite hard. It's a massive conflict with us. If you pack your bag now and go an live in Korea, you can imagine what it's like. And this isn't when you work with clients, this is big cultural differences, one of which is obviously that they [inaudible 00:13:16]. But it's a very different approach On this one? It was cool, it was really good. I mean, it depends on what role you take as a project manager, really, because clearly you have some people on the team that are very experienced, and then you have other people who are less experienced, maybe there's even juniors, straight out of university and stuff, so you have to put on a few different hats. You just project manage, but to the really inexperienced people, you're a kind of mentor, so there's a bit of teaching as you take them through this new thing that they're doing. And you have to support them, but I think you have to be firm as well if they do things wrong, or if they're not doing exactly what's expected of them, then you have to be a bit school teacher-ish. But then there's the other extreme for that is the really experienced people who are possibly even intimidating because they might be more experienced than you are. And they have a very specific way of doing things, and you have to debate whether that is the right process with them. The best way to get around all this obstacle course is to have a very open conversation right at the beginning with the whole team and just ask every team member, get them all to go, what's your goals? What do you want to do in this project? How do you want to approach it? What are you insecure about? What do you think you might need help with? All this kind of stuff. Just have a big conversation, right at the beginning, because that lets everyone understand that if you get into trouble halfway through the project and somebody's underperforming or it's not going well, you don't get on with someone, the least they feel they've got someone they can come and talk to, like the project manager. Or these are the systems here that we've got if things start going wrong. I dunno, I mean you hear about it all the time, there's people that don't get on, clearly. We don't all get on with each other. And there's times when people bitch and complain. But I've seen worse in other companies. For some reason, our deal employs the sort of people that can be adult about it and professional about it. We have had people here before who've been sacked quite quickly who can't deal in a professional ideal type work, stuff. And they haven't lasted very long. It's just an attitude thing, you have to try very hard when you employ people to understand that they're the right type of people. It was fine. I know we had one guy who had just joined. He'd had a long job before that, it wasn't a job, he was kind of self-employed before that. And he was just like working on his own for five, six years before he joined Ideal, and he was very difficult to bring into the team because he was very into it, he worked in [inaudible 00:17:27]. And that was tricky. It was very hard for the rest of the team to connect with him because he just wasn't around. He'd just go off somewhere and nobody knew what he was doing. I made quite a big point of sitting together, everyone sits together in the project space and you have to get on with them, so everyone does get on. You can't have people that... you just can't allow it. We've got about twenty CEOs and CTOs that all have something to say and all have some decision to make. It's just a fuckin' nightmare. It makes the project a nightmare because everything takes five times as long. And they go, right, we want the best this, the most innovative this, and no, we want... The feasibility of films come on, and they're just like, bang all the ideas. [inaudible 00:06:10]. And they go oh, we can't do that. So, it's well, don't do that, no, it doesn't make any money. Oh, can't do that, people won't like it. selling these things to women, make it more unisex, and how we can take the device out - what happens when you take the device out of the car and into your lives? So that, you know, that's nice. So they're asking for all this stuff, and I'm the one that's changed the brief, because it is, they're asking for stuff. They go, oh, are you doing this for us? We were expecting to see this, and yeah, you have to just say, oh, man, look at this statement of work, that's why it's here, there's the work [inaudible 00:08:40]. They still are going to write that at the beginning, with people that don't know what they're fuckin' doing, because you're just getting completely screwed by the client if you don't have a very concrete, very well-communicated statement of work at the beginning of the project. It's always tight, it's always very tight, yeah, it's all very tight. Some of these old designers, right, is that they're never satisfied. So we're all completely anal, and you polish diamonds forever, and it's never shiny enough. Most people are quite unhappy with the shit that they buy. you shouldn't be doing it, because the world's full of shit already, and you don't need to put any more shit into it. But it's more difficult with the Asian clients culturally, cause it's just difficult to connect with them. You just don't connect as well. Why don't we connect? Just cultural, I mean. It's just very difficult [crosstalk 00:12:29], especially in Korea, where it's very hierarchical, and everybody looks the same. You go over there and like you design everyone. So that's quite hard. It's a massive conflict with us. If you pack your bag now and go an live in Korea, you can imagine what it's like.   And that was tricky. It was very hard for the rest of the team to connect with him because he just wasn't around. He'd just go off somewhere and nobody knew what he was doing.",

    "text": "Our project [inaudible 00:18:46] was properly a disaster. That was... we were designing, stupid idea, shoes, right? Women's shoes. This is like, here was this inventor who'd been carrying this idea around since university that she wanted to design shoes with interchangeable heels. So you could wear them in office with one inch, and then go out at night and stick a three inch on, or whatever you want to do. And we took this project on in a bad time, I think, as well because we weren't doing very well financially. So we took this thing on, and it was just a nightmare because it was her baby, she'd loved this thing since she was eighteen or whatever, she had all these funky ideas of what we would've wanted to do, and we did the whole process. We went out, we had a few women, and we found that nobody wanted them. Everybody thought they were a shit idea. Women don't want one pair of shoes that change heel sizes. Women want twenty pairs of shoes, all different colors and all different heel sizes. She had an investment from a nester, she had about 90 grand or something, and she ended up, not suing us, but basically not paying us. Not being very unhappy with the delivery and all that stuff. We didn't even finish the project actually because it was [inaudible 00:20:37]. We told her, we were very honest about it, we said look, we don't think it's a good idea, we don't think you should pursue it, we think you should go somewhere else to get this done. We can give you this bit now, we can give you the user insert bit, and call it a day, and she's like, no, you're the designer, I want you to finish it, I want you to make a model, I was just like, ah, fuck it, we don't believe in it. We don't believe in it, that was the problem. So it's hard, when you get a client who wants something they're getting and you just don't believe in it. It's really fuckin' hard to design it. I mean, I guess that might... There was no point, the things that we told her, she didn't agree with as well. She wanted to go in at the very high end, into the retail, she wanted to sell these in fuckin' Prada, you know what I mean? And we're just like, why don't you just sell them at Top Shop for like $9.99? Exactly. And she just had it all wrong. She had this whole fuckin' idea about licensing it to Prada. It was a complete dream. It was a dream. It was a sham, because we shattered it for her. I have no idea what she's doing now, so So we took this thing on, and it was just a nightmare because it was her baby, she'd loved this thing since she was eighteen or whatever, she had all these funky ideas of what we would've wanted to do, and we did the whole process. So, we really didn't get any inspiration, and it was an engineering nightmare. You'd imagine, it's not where a foot goes from there to there, there's some very, very freaky engineering problems to deal with if you're talking about support and clicking this heel in and all this stuff. The [inaudible 00:20:15] changes dramatically. And it just went really badly. We can give you this bit now, we can give you the user insert bit, and call it a day, and she's like, no, you're the designer, I want you to finish it, I want you to make a model, I was just like, ah, fuck it, we don't believe in it.

    "text": "And we've been given that project. It's great. Brilliant opportunity. I think the hard thing about it is that it's a Korean client, who are like, ridiculously demanding, all the time. They need validation for everything that you do. They need to validate it. So hierarchical, it's just unbelievable. It's also a US project, so it's brought over from the US, so it's put very tight in the margins. Yeah, it's really, really good. Yeah. Fantastic project. Don't know what else to say about it, really. It's another project where we think, fuck, what a miserable piece of work. Why don't we just do it ourselves and sell it? Because they're gonna fuck it up. We've given this amazing design, right? And the problem is they don't know how to employ it. They don't know how it would take [inaudible 00:24:16]. And we help them with all that stuff. Of course we do. If we can, and you wanna pay for it, we'll help them. And we'll help them succeed. But with Asian clients, they don't, they just go, oh, give me the project. That's it. There's your money. See you later, Ideal. It's very hard to have any kind of relationship, build a relationship with them and get a trust going. Essentially, they're manufacturers, and they go, just give us the [inaudible 00:24:41], and then they make it wrong. And it's a nightmare. And they do it all wrong. The design intent's completely lost. And they end up with this shit design, and they go, oh, well, Ideal designed it, shoot. And it's because they haven't implemented it properly and it's a big problem. Because they've just done this big million dollar project, and then all of the sudden, Ideal's going, oh, if you give us another hundred grand, we'll help you implement it as well. And it just doesn't settle. They're all just trying to get their heads around the design, the whole team's going off now to start to make it, and it's just like, it's just so hard to get anybody in the organization who's got the clarity to actually go, yeah, we do need this, and I'm gonna take charge of it. I'm gonna liaise with Ideal and make sure that our teams are doing the right things. I'm gonna check in, we're gonna send review documents, [inaudible 00:25:51]. Cause in a way, it's reversing the relationship. We've been sending documents to them all the time, and they've been going oh, we don't like this idea, oh, we do like, can you change this? Can you change that? But all we're essentially asking the client to do now is send us a document every two weeks on how the development's going and we'll review it, and we'll give comments and suggestions on how to do it. And clients don't like doing that. It's a completely fuckin' weird position to put them in. No, they're not used to it, but it's that collaborative element that's really important that clients just don't do. And that's why they fall down all the time, cause they can't... It's me and Steve, really, on the big decisions. The two of us. And the client's side, again, we had to find the presentation, like, two weeks ago, and there was like a CTO and CEO from the, every fuckin' department in South Korea Telecom. It was crazy. There was like 40 people in the room. So I don't know, it's very hard. I mean, there's two people, essentially, that we're hearing decisions off, in the [inaudible 00:27:45]. But again, it's very hierarchical, so really, decisions don't get made - so hierarchies - the guy who makes the decision is the boss, the big boss. He's the one that... he has to be told every decision. That's why it's so hard [inaudible 00:28:01]. It's worse. I mean, European companies are much more wont to risk, but the Asian companies are just like - especially companies that produce computers and mobiles and stuff, they're all in this race. They're all competing with each other like, we have to get product out, next month, next quarter. We have to get the same features as Samsung's got. We have to get the same things as LG's got. It's just this, they're all just self-perpetuating, sort of, thing. Apple [inaudible 00:28:46] at doing this. It's just going right, let's step back, let's spend five years or something, let's develop the iPhone, and then put it out, right, and it'll blow everyone away, and it did. But Asian companies don't do that. They don't stop their order and go right, we're gonna really think about this now. We're gonna do something that's really worthwhile, because they're all in this horrible, like, you know, let's just make loads of shit, that's all there is. It was pretty clear. I mean it was a pretty tame designer, [inaudible 00:29:48] TV in a remote control. It was a really clean brief. But in fact, we changed it all along, but it was a clear brief from the start. Yeah, it became less clear, but it didn't become less clear, it's just that they often try to change it. But it's still very clear in the brief. In my eyes, it's still very clear what we're doing. Yeah. Very fucking funny. They don't talk. They don't say anything. Weirdest conference calls in the world, right, you won't believe it, mate. You'll sit in three hour conference calls on the phone with them, right? And there'll be one person speaks from their side, but there'll be eight of them sitting 'round the phone. They don't say anything. It's this whole opinion thing. They don't say anything. And you're always like, you feel daft, cause you're always asking, are you all right? What do you think? You show them stuff, and they have no opinion. And you're just like, well, what do you think? And they go, oh, I think the CEO might think it's a bit, like, it's not colorful enough. Or they'll always talk from someone else's point of view. So you can never get that, well, what do you think? Do you like the fucking design or what? They won't tell you. So it's very weird. On the last one... the trouble with a lot of Asian clients is that they just treat you like a supplier. Do you know what I mean? You go into their board rooms, and stuff, and the CEO, he'll go up, won't even look at you. He'll sit right at the front. It's a room the size of this, with all these fuckin' [inaudible 00:35:03] microphones. You gotta talk in a mic, right? He'll sit right at the front. Everyone else will sit right at the back of the room. Anybody who's not important will sit at the back, right? So it's just this ridiculous kind of hierarchy. And then the main guy, they'll all bow, and then they'll scuttle off somewhere, to the sides of the room. Any you'll be like, well, where's anyone? Please come down, we can't see. You've got a screen this big. And it's very hard to communicate on a basic level. On a basic level, it's impossible. And they just don't respond. So you go, like, come down, you have to come closer cause you need to see this screen. We've got TV here, we're gonna [inaudible 00:35:44] one. And they're like, come down! They won't say anything, cause they're not allowed to say anything. And then you have to look at the main guy, like, can they come down, and he'll go like, yeah, and he'll go like that. And then they'll all come down. Absolutely mad. I think it's great. Again, I'm working with people who I know very well, so we know each other very well, and that helps. I've been lucky, I guess. I'm mostly a person you may trust a lot. It's fine. Trust's a big thing. You've gotta trust your team. You've gotta empower them to do their own thing. Once you've got a level of trust set, I think [inaudible 00:36:59]. Yeah, of course it does, yeah, it's like boyfriend-girlfriend, isn't it? You know each other well, you just know how to start things. You don't have to have your dating period. It depends how honest you've been about it. If you've held it inside and you haven't talked about it at the project review or something, then you have this deep-seeded resentment for somebody in the team, then that's gonna be a nightmare. You're gonna have a problem. But again, I think, being professional about it doesn't allow that kind of thing, and you have to just get on otherwise, there's team members I've worked with before that've been quite intimidating. You know, they've been very experienced, and they've been very opinionated, and you're just like, okay, now, hold on a minute, I don't actually agree. Can't you just slow down a bit? there's team members I've worked with before that've been quite intimidating. You know, they've been very experienced, and they've been very opinionated, and you're just like, okay, now, hold on a minute, I don't actually agree. Can't you just slow down a bit? And you've been intimidated by them. And then if you get resourced with them again, clearly you're gonna think, oh, fuck, I'm not gonna do that again. But If you've voiced that concern to them, I know it's hard to do that, but you have to. You have to say, look, you know, in the project review, I think this bit didn't go very well because we didn't talk openly about the ways that we're gonna work together. That's how most people do it, actually. Important to talk. Each time there is resentments. I think you would just have conflicts, because you all have to take a role. And normally a conflict arises where people are overlapping too much on certain roles. So, you know, if you've got two interaction designers working together, you normally have one who's doing documentation, the other one is doing creative visualization. You don't have both of them doing visualization because they'll just go like, no, my idea's better, I like this better than yours. They'll just fight the whole time. And if you have someone on the team who wants to be a project manager when you're the project manager, clearly you're gonna get into an area of conflict where roles are... you've just gotta define the roles. That's hard, I know. I've never been in a really bad situation where my role has been... actually... Great. We were all friends with each other, really. It was good. I mean, we got a new VHF girl who it was her first project, first big Ideal project, and she was great. It was kind of stressful for her, but she was cool, she's really nice. It's very hard to have any kind of relationship, build a relationship with them and get a trust going. Essentially, they're manufacturers, and they go, just give us the [inaudible 00:24:41], and then they make it wrong. Millions of companies just make millions of different devices that all look exactly the same, and they're all shit. And they'll user desirability is just completely, not even a part of the thing. ou'll sit in three hour conference calls on the phone with them, right? And there'll be one person speaks from their side, but there'll be eight of them sitting 'round the phone. They don't say anything. It's this whole opinion thing. They don't say anything. And you're just like, well, what do you think? And they go, oh, I think the CEO might think it's a bit, like, it's not colorful enough. Or they'll always talk from someone else's point of view. So you can never get that, well, what do you think? Do you like the fucking design or what? He'll sit right at the front. Everyone else will sit right at the back of the room. Anybody who's not important will sit at the back, right? We've got TV here, we're gonna [inaudible 00:35:44] one. And they're like, come down! They won't say anything, cause they're not allowed to say anything. And then you have to look at the main guy, like, can they come down, and he'll go like, yeah, and he'll go like that. And then they'll all come down. Absolutely mad. 'm mostly a person you may trust a lot. It's fine. Trust's a big thing.   I think this bit didn't go very well because we didn't talk openly about the ways that we're gonna work together. That's how most people do it, actually. You don't have both of them doing visualization because they'll just go like, no, my idea's better, I like this better than yours.",

    "text": "Yes, very, very different. And so, when I arrived in January, there was this whole discussion in the office about that everything was bogged down in research and a lot of the designers were feeling like, `Oh, I spend so much time thinking and not doing.` And I think the HF team has been kind of labeled with this kind of `Research, Research` than `Design`. And so, with the SKT one, it was really great, because I kind of came in and we were designing straight from the beginning of the sketching and everything and the whole team doing it and it was amazing how that really lifted you to see the design of specific designers really engaged with the project, because it wasn't seen as `HF phase`, ` design phase`. It was very much very integrated quickly. And that was really nice. Everyone kept commenting, `Oh, [inaudible 00:09:37]`, and that was really, really nice, because as a team, together, we really wanted to do this let's design and think and understand all at the same time. And that was really nice. It's a very positive thing amongst the team. So, I'd say, for me, that was the biggest thing that stood out. A lot of people in the HF guys have been talking about this saying, `Let's start talking about this SKT project`, about how we can design out front and about how that's good for inspiration, as well as going out and seeing and observing and talking to people. That's kind of really inspiring for the team internally. So, that was the one thing that I found very frustrating. I've got some some good design skills and abilities, but I've never quite been able to use those fully. So, that's kind of why coming Ideo was very nice and [inaudible 00:12:09] SKT project, I thought I wanted designers on the team and not just an HF person. We all felt like designers, so... That was like, for that project, really quite empowering, actually. It was really quite nice, considering the discussions that had been going on internally about how to start reframing this HF phase and getting out of that and reframing it as design research instead. Yeah, everything in the office was all products like remote controls and, in particular, this project was quite unusual for me to think I would still do this kind of work. But, yes, it was very, very different. So, I think, the way in which we think about things here and now is a lot broader because of that. Now I see it, when I come here now, we do think bigger extremes, where before, I felt, that we thought often within the boundaries of the actual product rather than thinking much broader about other extremes of behaviors and how that could influence our thinking. Where, now, I feel it seems to be much broader thinking. That's a strange one actually, because it was a really awkward... A really unusual... Sorry, unusual in terms of western client collaboration, I'd say, but probably normal for Asian. We had a core project team that we were working with and that was our day to day communication. I would say there was one person on that team that was the decision maker within the next big cell of decision makers, the big wigs sitting at the top. So, he was the kind of linchpin between the two, but he was not always there, so then he had the sub core team that would be working on a day to day basis with us. They'd be kind of feeding, kind of like a ladder up and down and all the decisions. So, from Ant and Steve on our project, it would go through various people. Safe to say, I think, four maximum different key decision makers on that team and then fed through and interpreted, sometimes incorrectly, through the smaller core team. So it was, I'd say, four people that make the decisions on their side through various filters both ways and then for us, Ant and Steve driving the process this end. No, no. It was often... It took us some time to get to that. I think when decisions were needed to be made, we started kind of uncovering cracks in that process and they haven't fully explained that kind of decision process. Eight weeks in? Eight weeks in when they started to pick our cracks in communication between them and thinking, `This is not quite running as smoothly.` And then kind of checking back and then creating down time for us, where we needed to use it, but they wanted to make decisions. Big words, but big guts when it comes down to it. Huge, right at the beginning, you know, we were employing you because want big change. We want to really kind of push the boundaries and the big word to them was `differentiate` and in the market everything's the same. So, they really spoke very heavily about all of that, but as we moved through, they started stepping back from big decisions. `We're not ready to do that, we don't want to do that.` So, our big ideas started being pinched and we had to reframe how we were thinking things because of that. So, I would say, their willingness to take risks was actually... I would say, it changed. I would say, at the beginning, how they set the scene, I would say it was high. It then went to low as we started getting into the design details and manufacturing possibilities. And then, I would actually say, we managed to stop pushing them out again and explaining that if we do this, you differentiate, if we do this, you achieve this in the market. So, I think it was high, it dipped very low, and then we managed to push it back up again. Low/medium, yeah. To get them to just push the boundaries a little bit forward and take a little bit more risk. But that did constrain the ways we did it. But, yeah, I think we dipped very low and then managed to start pushing them out again and getting them to understand where they could really make big gains through only making certain strategic decisions, instead of all of them. I think we were cherry picking the ones that would have the biggest impact on the user and there was also balance in terms of their manufacturing capabilities, where we felt that they would be comfortable to move forward as well. So, it was kind of a fine balancing act, I think. There's some things that we would do a bit earlier on, instead of leaving it as it was and I think after me after trying to encourage them to push things forward, make decisions earlier on... But also, the expectations around the deliverable, I think, were potentially, our deliverable, was back in the guidelines. And I think maybe they saw it as a false specification. So I think some of the differences in handing over between the two offices. Something slipped through the net, I think, and we were having to deal with those on the fly, really, and kind of just managed those as we went. This was something about because we were handing over a kind semi finished sort of designed guideline. We felt it was necessary that there was potentially an opportunity to have some kind of user testing to understand were we covered? It's just about what is right now, let's test and see whether that would work, part of the design and how we'll change that. And that wasn't kind of specked in as part of the product, but that's something, as a team, we all would've included. That was something we inanely encouraged the client that was a necessary part in the next stage of work that they would do to actually incorporate that, because we couldn't have passed it with the kind of project scope. So yeah, I think there was certain things that we would just do differently, just because we work differently. And I think it was... We did comment on those. It's amazing when you hand over a project that's been defined by a different office. How differently, as a team, you'd do that and do things quite sort of different time frames of things and how long you'll spend on certain things, so, that was quite interesting. Trying to fit in with the Palo Alto framework of scope of work. I think, with that, we work closely with the BD guy out in the states to do that, so there was kind of a forehand over to the UK, over to the London office. But with someone with [inaudible 00:29:02] from the kind of Palo Alto office, so that he was always kind of a link in, because SKT originally had the conversations with the Palo Alto office and Charles, in particular. He remained kind of on the side of the project, I think we can maintain that connection. So, he'd already had a relationship with the company and had worked on previous projects, so he remained as kind of within the team as a check in point, would make regular calls, would kind of understand whether the SKT team was fully up to speed on what we were currently doing now. So it was kind of like a check in process. I think potentially to keep the SKT team happy... Well, I don't know if it was actually that necessary, because I think we controlled the ups and downs and day to day changes of what happened in the project, so I'm not sure that was a complete necessary thing. I don't know how [crosstalk 00:30:06] felt about that. There was a whole issue about the translation. There was one guy on the project, but very [inaudible 00:30:20] educated in America. And his personally feelings about how the design should be often clouded clear communication between the team. And so, he would drip feed. Yeah and he would drip feed what he felt was necessary through to the rest of the client team, so that became another thing to deal with. We started to have to manage that.  Yeah and he would drip feed what he felt was necessary through to the rest of the client team, so that became another thing to deal with. We started to have to manage that. He would taint it. So, that made communication lengthy and difficult, because someone in the team would then ask it in a kind of broken English, we would understand. And we thought we'd just explained that ten minutes ago, but he'd obviously hadn't included it in the discussion, so you'd be startled after a while to figure out he isn't being completely honest. [inaudible 00:31:22] in all translations. I think it got to the fact that on all the key important documents, we had them translated, because the guys at the top were making decisions... He would be feeding the documents through and translating them, so this would say this, that would say that. In the end, the ones that really were critical in the guys fully understanding our design thinking, we had those translated. Yeah, internally here, so there was no misinterpretation. Everything that was on that, the CEO's would all have a clear understanding of what that was and so they could make a clear decision. So, that's kind of how we ended up resolving that particular sticky situation. I would say that there wasn't enough... Because writing up the documentation was so lengthy to ensure that the right stuff was going through to the guys that mattered, because we'd been communicating with them on a day to day basis. It made things much more bogged down, in detail, then we would normally have, I'd say, with any other clients [inaudible 00:33:11] or wonder, didn't have that level of communication internally. And it added an extra element of us being more thorough with how we documented it and gave across our design thinking and thought processes. So, I'd say, that, in itself, started to... It kind of really was heavy on the project team. In terms of doing the work, but also explaining why they're doing it. It added another element, so... The rest of it, I'd say, if that hadn't been necessary, would have been a really well specked out, timely project. Fluctuation a lot, I'd say. From my side in particular, because they don't give much feedback. They're not `this is really bad`, `this is really good`... It's actually quite tough when you've worked on something and they don't actually give you any feedback. They just go, `Okay, that's fine.` Then they kind of [inaudible 00:35:15] agree to it, but they don't pass any comment to you. It's really demoralizing when you've worked your back side off and you don't get anything from them. You get no emotional connection, so I'd say emotional connection's very low. And there was a lot of drip feeding and hand holding and explaining about what we're doing throughout. So, I'd say actually time spent with them was quite lengthy, but a complete lack of emotional connection with them, which is quite demoralizing. So, yeah, I think that'd probably be the way of summarizing it. I think, at last minute, I think it could've only kind of been different if the client core team felt confident in their ability to pass judgment and make comments. I felt because they were the middle playing field between management and us, that's all they ever did was kind of pass information and feed between the two sources. So, I think if they would've been able to have a position of value on the team and I think that would've changed then greatly. I think that was probably the problem, they couldn't do that. And yeah, I think that's probably the frustrating thing for us, as a team. They didn't do that, all the comments would always be talked about and how frustrating that was not to hear their feedback, their personal kind of beliefs about the project and how they think it went. They always skirted around that, even when kind of pushed. No one would ever say anything, so I think that was quite demoralizing as a team, not to hear that. Great. Ant's easy to get on with. As a team, we're all very different. All very [inaudible 00:37:39], their some real different characters. Like Graham, for example, he's a very, very different character than I. We got on very well. And you had , he's very, very different to all of us. We actually gelled very well. And Ant is very much like, he wants you to take control of your stuff and do it and him to add value where he can and I think that's really nice. He kind of empowers you to do stuff rather than take that away from you, so that worked really well. Really good, actually. Fun. We were able to crack jokes and make each other laugh under the most extreme pressure and tension. I think, when you can do that, you've really nailed a good project team. When it can be quite, people are really working on [inaudible 00:38:37] and when we can do that, then that was really good. So I think that was probably the highlight of the project team, actually. Actually, on the way to Korea two weeks ago, we were all quite nervous about doing the presentation and we just had an e-mail sent through from someone over in the states and we'd all found it quite funny and humorous and we'd all be making internal jokes about it and that was the one thing that I think kept us going throughout that week of the presentation. We all just kept cracking the same old jokes. I think that worked. That was really important for keeping the team going, having a good laugh. `Okay, if you had this kind of remote control or this kind of TV interface, how would that change the way you behaved?` So, we started to use it for early on, sparking big thoughts, rather than coming up with those once we've seen people, so That was like, for that project, really quite empowering, actually. It was really quite nice, considering the discussions that had been going on internally about how to start reframing this HF phase and getting out of that and reframing it as design research instead. Yeah, yeah. People are being so sensible now, I hear. But then you always have to [inaudible 00:14:23]. I was speaking to Paul Bennett when I first got here and said, `It's very different, like you haven't got your nutters. Eight weeks in when they started to pick our cracks in communication between them and thinking, `This is not quite running as smoothly.` We're not ready to do that, we don't want to do that.` So, our big ideas started being pinched and we had to reframe how we were thinking things because of that.

    "text": "And at that second one here, we showed them four different options in terms of design, building on what they told us in the first one and we deliberately had the same people come back in so that there was a continuity there. They could see the development. And then we just got their opinion on the positives and negatives of each one we showed them. And then we kind of took that [inaudible 00:17:30] that information down to get to the direction we actually end up in the end. Of course, with I suppose the outside ... if this is all user stuff, we also ... coming into it, we had other inspirations outside of just talking to the consumers like, what's good out there at the moment in that marketspace, but also in other marketspaces, so you don't have to just look in the marketspace you are actually designing for. You can get inspiration from other ones just as easily. I suppose one thing we do here, typically anyway, is the core team focused on one project at a time, so in this case, there was a few part-time team members, but their job was more going around working on multiple projects and reviewing and adding in. The core team were focusing on the one project, so you can get really deep embedded knowledge. We were experimenting with ways to kind of make it easier to work across multiple projects, 'cause I know a lot of other firms you'll see are working on multiple projects at a time. And that's something, historically, we haven't really done, because you get so in depth, you're like living in your space with your team. You kind of live that product or whatever you're designing for that many weeks. Cause the other projects, the one that I would say didn't go as well, was where, it was kind of even an experiment and I was working across two projects, for the same client. It was just two projects. That one I just felt like I never really, in the right space at the right time. I was kind felt like I was always catching up on things as it went along, so that was the one I probably didn't feel was as inspiration as it could have been 'cause I didn't feel I had the time really, to be inspired. Decision makers, well I suppose we all are on our side really. We also had one main client we were dealing with. But there was also three to four of his team as well, but it was really helpful 'cause he was obviously the main decision maker and the meetings where we had ... he was the one we were talking to the whole way through. The meetings were more like our opportunity to present and convince the others that this was the right direction and luckily we were on track a lot of the time. They were happy with how we were going. It was really one key decision maker, client side. And he was passing on the information of what we'd been doing to the rest of the guys. We just used the meetings if they were concerned about something, then we'd flag it up and we'd all work on it and make sure we're happy with the decision before we left the meeting. And then our side, I suppose what worked well in this team is ... 'cause we weren't, obviously we weren't all ... some of the people were doing this part-time alongside other things, because it was such a small project, we had to get such a lot done. There was several tracks of things happening at times, so for instance, there might be a business factors conversation happening with them meeting a client when I'm not there, even though I'm project managing because I have to do a design by the end of the day. There's the design element, then there was the engineering element, and these were kind of all happening together. And not all of us needed to be in all the conversations, as long as at certain points, we'd have a meeting, whether that'd be a physical meeting or email, to let everyone in the team know what was happening. If I hadn't been in this conversation, but then I had to have a meeting with the client, I still knew what had been said in that meeting. That means, we could be really productive in terms of the time, because everyone was really good about communicating in the project teams. It's really important in order for you to be able to kind of move forward quickly. I think that's what worked really well in this particular case. But the brief for this particular one was good type brief because partly down to the nature of the fact that they came to us with something and knew if they wanted a direction in terms of three different strategies, from where they came to us with. In that case, it wasn't like, `What's the future of blah.` It was like, `We've got this particular idea. We are convinced it's good and we want you to help us develop it.` Whereas some of the ones in the past, like for instance, some briefs totally change as well, like I'm working on the project a while ago. It's like, `We want a new packaging shape, box.` We were like, `Okay, well, that's fine but we don't really tend ... we tend to work on broader problems than just that.` And when we started looking into it, we realized that it wasn't necessary. They just needed a new shape, 'cause anyone ... you can put it in any shape. You need to have a reason as to why you use that shape, if it's gonna be a good idea. And we were saying, `Well, actually, what you need is, you need to position your brand slightly differently and create a new category for yourself within this particular aisle.` And so we kind of ... we gave them a new shape and everything, but we also backed it up with a lot of thinking about why this particular shape, why we think it's a good direction to move in and what they would also need to do with branding and communications in order to create the story. It was more, we think they need a new, a further in terms of helping push the brand, giving it a story, and showing that through a new packaging format, rather than just giving them a new shape. Do you see what I mean? Sometimes it's a bit more tricky. It was just iterative in terms of meetings, 'cause we don't really know ourselves until we've gone out and actually seen how things are working. We'll go out and once we've figured out that it's not quite exactly as we think ... basically you've got to all the time, think about what you think the client needs and then flag it up at the next available time, whether that's over a phone call, through the meeting lined up, you just say ... we kind of pave the way for it in a lot of the presentations anyway. And then obviously the client's got to agree that they think that's the right direction you've got to be moving in 'cause otherwise they'll be upset if they come in and at the very end isn't very collaborative with the clients in terms of if we feel the brief needs to slightly change in steering into a slightly different route than ... What inspired us? A combination of a lot of things, really. The user co-creation sessions were probably the biggest source of inspiration, but also the idea we were working with was a great idea, so that helped a lot. Yeah, just the team. The team was a great team on this one. We worked really well together, because we were different specialisms. Or like we'd, I don't know, go and get a few printouts and put on the table and go, `What do you think, guys?` And be like, `Okay, I like this one and this one. I like this one.` `Fine, make a decision and move on.` So, it was very kind of quick. It produced a lot of stuff very quickly. I think that allowed us to get much further down the path, much sooner, so we could spend a lot more time on the final direction that we gave them. Good. He was very supportive, very willing to hear our arguments for various things, to get us involved in all different conversations that were happening, really get in the meetings in terms of ... 'cause obviously he'd be our main contact so we'd keep him in the loop about everything and then he'd be telling his team, so he's very of us in the meetings and all along really. So, yeah it was a good client relationship. I was kind of joint ... 'cause basically, Suzy was also doing the engineering. She was kind of supporting me a bit, when basically there was weeks of high production, when I was very sucked into the design, she'd be there. She was basically leading the engineering conversation with him, 'cause he's much more experienced in that side of things as well and I know nothing about that side of things. Yeah, she was kind of helping doing the project management as well. I think it was very good. I mean I felt it was very good. You can ask Ben. I think you're speaking to him as well. I thought ... because we were doing this kind of track, doing everything, it was quite nice 'cause you kind of could feel it, so I think the design as well, it was more like working together is very much more like that. It's not really very hierarchal, however you say that. It's not like art director type role. It's much more like with it embedded in the team in terms of the design, so we'd work together. I suppose the main core difference with the project leadership role is that you've gotta know what's happening all at the same time and make sure that everyone understands what they have to be doing in that particular time so they feel productive, 'cause we were moving so quickly. But also, making sure that we did have ... that we were very good about talking about what was going on and what happened makes people feel confident that they know what's happened to them when they're put in a situation in front of the client, they can answer questions. I suppose it was a combination of good communication, all the time, even with people who weren't necessarily in the space with us all the time. Kind of relaxed working environment in terms of, I get on really well with both the guys who I was working with in terms of design. Anyway, very kind of relaxed, in terms of open to sharing ideas and being critical of them as well, like objective criticism, not taking offense if someone says, “Oh, I don't really like that.” Stuff like that. Also, I suppose the key difference with the leadership was also you're speaking ... you're the main point of contact for the client. Making sure that if there's issues, even if it's maybe not on your track that you're working on, that you can kind of talk to these guys and take that on board and then talk to the client and get back to them so that they feel like something's been done about it, so problems don't grate or where you ... they're brought to the attention of everyone. You can just deal with them as they come. I think if you do all that, then if it was like it's moving along and things are being dealt with rather than left to fester. And then have fun as well. Have a laugh. Have music on. We have things like Disney hour. Or requesting hour, where people ... we'd have the music on, the people in the project space next to us would request songs across the wall and we'd have to play them. So, just stuff like that make it fun while you're doing it. I think if you do all that, then if it was like it's moving along and things are being dealt with rather than left to fester. We went out initially, researched shops to understand the market. It was slightly different in this case. I don't know if it's the best example, if you're looking for idea generation tips because we were approached with a specific idea and asked to build on it And then, instead of doing more in home interviews, we then asked the users to come in to workshops that were kind of in the project, like those two milestones. And we basically, they were like co-creation sessions and with the users, They could see the development. And then we just got their opinion on the positives and negatives of each one we showed them. And then we kind of took that [inaudible 00:17:30] that information down to get to the direction we actually end up in the end. And that's something, historically, we haven't really done, because you get so in depth, you're like living in your space with your team. You kind of live that product or whatever you're designing for that many weeks. cause I didn't feel I had the time really, to be inspired. uckily we were on track a lot of the time. We just used the meetings if they were concerned about something, then we'd flag it up and we'd all work on it and make sure we're happy with the decision before we left the meeting. Well, he came to us with something ... he's kind of an inventor guy, so he's kind of able to describe that's what he wants. `Okay, well, that's fine but we don't really tend ... we tend to work on broader problems than just that.` And when we started looking into it, we realized that it wasn't necessary. The user co-creation sessions were probably the biggest source of inspiration, but also the idea we were working with was a great idea, so that helped a lot. Yeah, just the team. The team was a great team on this one. We worked really well together, because we were different specialisms. Or like we'd, I don't know, go and get a few printouts and put on the table and go, `What do you think, guys?` And be like, `Okay, I like this one and this one. I like this one.` So, yeah, I think it's a lot of things. The client as well, he was really good at being involved and supportive of what we were doing. I was kind of joint ... 'cause basically, Suzy was also doing the engineering. She was kind of supporting me a bit  think it was very good. I mean I felt it was very good. that we were very good about talking about what was going on and what happened makes people feel confident that they know what's happened to them when they're put in a situation in front of the client, they can answer questions.  suppose it was a combination of good communication,   Anyway, very kind of relaxed, in terms of open to sharing ideas and being critical of them as well, like objective criticism, not taking offense if someone says, “Oh, I don't really like that.” Stuff like that.",

    "text": "A project that doesn't go so well. They're all just so terribly successful. I had a little tiny project where basically, I felt like what the client wanted was not what people wanted, and we basically ended up saying, `We should just stop our work now.` It wasn't political. It wasn't a problem with relationships with the client or anything like that. They were interested in a technology for technology's sake, and we basically said, `People don't care about that technology, or about the perceived need that the technology is answering,` and so that's a place where we've not finished a project. But I think in the end, that's probably considered successful consultmanship, because we were basically really positive about it.

But I think in the end, that's probably considered successful consultmanship, because we were basically really positive about it. The project I mentioned with the stakeholder who was passive-aggressive, and not very helpful, that as a project on cholesterol medication, and I think what was less successful about that is this enormous company, Pfizer, they make bazillions of dollars every second of the year, and they invest in so many different strategies and organizations and creative agencies that it's hard to see where ... The piece of work they gave IDEO was probably a pretty generously sized project for us. Not huge, but a decent size project, and for us it was pretty big, and we paid quite a lot of attention it, and had a pretty large team on it, but for them, it was just one of 20 projects like that, and so trying to figure out ... And I guess this comes back to how well you know your client, how much trust they have in you. He was satisfied with our work, but he never really connected with us as a strategic partner. He basically had a little extra money and said, `I'll have IDEO look into some of these things,` and we delivered nice work that he was pleased with, but he never really opened up to what else is happening for him, for his part of the organization, what are their strategic goals? What are all these other little initiatives you're doing? How can we make sure we're supporting those? Of course, we asked all of those questions, but he just didn't tell us, and he didn't ever so much as come out to dinner with us. I think they were pleased, I'm just not sure anything ever happened with the work that we did. There was some interesting stuff that we uncovered, and I think it's mostly because we were treated like one of many agencies and not as a strategic partner. Well, I think I definitely would have tried to have the conversations about what else is going on. I mean, it's hard, because we invited him out to dinner a hundred times. There are milestones in a project. There's a kickoff meeting, and there's a midway meeting, and a blah blah meeting, and the meetings we would schedule from 2:00 to 4:00 P.M. on Monday. He would show up at 2:01 and leave at 4:00, and that was it. What we tried to do was say, `Hey, why don't we meet before for an hour?` And he'd go, `I'll try to put that on my schedule.` Or we'd say, ` How about we meet for drinks or coffee or dinner afterwards just so we can talk about how it went?` `Oh, sorry. I'm busy.` That kind of thing. There was just never extra time to connect with this guy. If you wanted to make a phone call and talk about things, you could, but he was just such a busy person, running from meeting to meeting to meeting to meeting, to probably all these agencies, that he just never really stopped to share with us the big picture. I guess I just would have pushed back a lot more on that. Probably, and he was very confident. He wasn't a non-confident person. He's the one who had the market research person reporting to him who was quite passive-aggressive, and actually damaging to our project. We had some politically difficult conversations with him to say, ` Hey, this woman is not being very helpful, and we could be delivering a lot more for you if you would help her help us. If she's leading three of these other things, and we're doing this one, how can we help her look good with these other things? How can we not reinvent the wheel?` I think he just had this attitude that, `Let's throw money at five different places and see what comes out.` It was more competitive. I think it was his whole attitude what we would deliver for him. It also, I think, depends on what the client is looking for, and that's something we've found in the current business climate, that often budgets are shrinking, and sometimes what a client needs is something very small. They just need an idea. What's the next successful idea for Vittel Water, for instance? They don't necessarily want a strategy for Vittel Water. Normally, IDEO defaults to, `Here are a thousand cool little ideas for you, Vittel, but what we really want to tell you about is this new strategy moving forward,` you know what I mean?

We had some politically difficult conversations with him to say, ` Hey, this woman is not being very helpful, and we could be delivering a lot more for you if you would help her help us. With him, we had this really great insights, and we had this really nice way that they could strategically think about their drug and their patients in a new way that could be really successful, and really much better for patients, and therefore, better for them, but they just weren't coming to us for that, I think. I think they were viewing us as one agency of many who was possibly coming up with little nuanced ideas that, all thrown in a big pot, would add to their business. That was another thing I'm remembering now. It was quite a long time ago, but we would have an idea, and it would be very similar to something they already do, but the nuances were slightly different. It's about the tone of voice or the way that ... With cholesterol, it's a tough illness or condition, because you can't feel it. You don't know if you have high or low cholesterol, and you don't really know if it's going to affect you or not, and the outcome could be that you possibly have a heart attack or a stroke at some time in the future, but you don't know when that might be. It's really abstract for people, and also, people feel like they can control their cholesterol. Anyway, so there are all these really interesting insights around cholesterol, and so a lot of the ideas that we had were very subtle about these intangible, nuanced understandings of it. Yeah, so we'd say, ` Okay, if you want people to track their cholesterol over time, here are the ways that you could do it in a more subtle way, giving them more control, et cetera,` and they'd say, `We already have that. We already have a way to track cholesterol.` We'd say, `We see that, but it's not the same subtle way. See what we've done here. Blah blah blah.` They never quite got that, so I don't know how much more you can explain things or ... Anyway. I mean, again, I think everything comes down to communication. I always think that if IDEO isn't successful at communicating the nuance behind our ideas, then we may as well not come up with the ideas, and so figuring out how to switch the light bulb on for the client is the main goal of any project, I guess. I put that out of my mind. That was the first project I came over to London to work on. She was absolutely convinced that women needed this shoe, and the problem is when you talk to people, you're kind of like, `Yeah, I could see using that,` but then if you really talked to people, there's no way they'd ever use something like that. No. No, and she absolutely couldn't get it. The worst part was, she got special funding to come to IDEO, and she was sort of a friend of IDEO. It was miserable in every possible way. On the client side, the cholesterol project was the one main guy, but he had his market research lady who passively affected a lot of the decision-making, so maybe one and a half. On our side, we had me as the project manager, and then the support of these two senior people at least, so it was at least three, three decision-makers, maybe. They were interested in a technology for technology's sake, e was satisfied with our work, but he never really connected with us as a strategic partner. He basically had a little extra money and said, `I'll have IDEO look into some of these things,` and we delivered nice work that he was pleased with, but he never really opened up to what else is happening for him, just never really stopped to share with us the big picture. I guess I just would have pushed back a lot more on that. Normally, IDEO defaults to, `Here are a thousand cool little ideas for you, Vittel, but what we really want to tell you about is this new strategy moving forward,` you know what I mean? PROJECT ID `Let's throw money at five different places and see what comes out.` With him, we had this really great insights, and we had this really nice way that they could strategically think about their drug and their patients in a new way that could be really successful, and really much better for patients, and therefore, better for them, but they just weren't coming to us for that, I think. `We already have that.

The worst part was, she got special funding to come to IDEO, and she was sort of a friend of IDEO. It was miserable in every possible way. people said, `Yeah, I guess it's all out there, but frankly, I cannot be bothered to be worrying about that. There are so many other things in my life that I can worry about,  I actually handed this out to all their employees, what that would mean. There are often just people who have an idea for the idea's sake, and these guys wanted to capitalize on the fear that was happening. Anyway.",

    "text": "Interestingly enough, the first project with that bank, it's funny because it was a very high manager in the bank said, `I'm interested in innovation, and I'm interested in our bank becoming more innovative.` IDEO usually says, ` Great, we can help you become more innovative.` There, I've stopped saying innovative. Anyway, `We can help you do that. The best way to do that is to start with a project as an example. Let's do a piece of work to show you how our process works, how we are innovative, and how it could be relative to you, and then we can start thinking about changing your organization to be that way.` We did this project on credit cards with them. There was a very high-level sponsor who was keen about IDEO, keen about innovation, and keen to try the project on credit cards. They're the ones who selected it. Meanwhile, the credit card guys, down several levels in the organization, were kind of like, `What's going on here? Why are you bringing in a consultant? I'm doing my job just fine. We're making lots of money. We're successful. Why are you having someone come and innovate my area?` And so in fact, they were quite passive-aggressive and negative clients, come to think of it, in terms of being supportive of our work, or giving us research information, that kind of thing. Meanwhile, the credit card guys, down several levels in the organization, were kind of like, `What's going on here? Why are you bringing in a consultant? I'm doing my job just fine. We're making lots of money. We're successful. Why are you having someone come and innovate my area?` And so in fact, they were quite passive-aggressive and negative clients, come to think of it, in terms of being supportive of our work, or giving us research information, that kind of thing. The project ended up being, I think, quite successful and unique, because we were able to come up with something that was very, very different. It was interesting, because they wanted us to be disruptive. I've learned since then that the word disruptive in a banking or a business context is not necessarily good. Disrupting a market is, I guess, good, if you are the disruptor, and you're well prepared to do it, but it's hard if the disruption is actually to your systems or if the disruption isn't quite ... I mean, if you were one of the established players in a market, disrupting the market isn't necessarily very good, absolutely, and so we learned a little bit about that, but we basically came up with this unique idea, and to a layperson, it doesn't sound that unique, but to the Swiss market, it was pretty interesting. Because of our relationship with the higher level management, we were able to get them to commit to trying it out in a market, in the market. It's been really successful that way, in that normally, they would have analyzed this new idea and said, `We don't have enough data because it's so different than everything else, so we can't actually analyze it. Therefore, we can't create a business case. Therefore, we can't do anything about this. Therefore, thank you very much for your work, IDEO, but we're going to put this on a shelf.` Because of our relationship with the higher level people and the sponsor, basically, for the project, we were able to get some traction, and they were able to try things in a different way, and say, `Okay, they have no precedent for this kind of thing. We can't make a business case. We're a bank. We usually only make business cases to do projects. We're going to try things differently.` It was a big organizational lesson, a big process lesson, that kind of thing, and it's in process. I think the hard part is this stuff takes a very long time. It took us 12 weeks to come up with the idea and present it quite nicely, and then it takes a year and a half to put it into a pilot, a test market, where 300 people try it out, because a banking product is unique in that it's not quite like, `Oh, here's a piece of technology. We've made a prototype of this recording device. We'll give it to 100 students and see how it goes.` It's more like, if it's a banking product, it has to actually work. A credit card has to work in every machine in the world, and it has to be a real credit card, so prototyping, or piloting something like that, is quite a lot more traumatic than you first think. That's been an example of something that's been quite successful. Then of course, that project has snowballed into other projects with the same client, and because we're little by little learning about different parts of their organization, we've had a lot of success that way. The other project we've done with the same organization is on their customer service experience, basically. That has been very different in the kind of project it is, because it's about a one-on-one service that you provide. As you can imagine, with any organization, especially a large bank, if you are providing a one-on-one service, and you have thousands of employees, and hundreds of thousands of customers, the number of one-on-one types of service that people get is millions of different kinds of experiences, and trying to design a consistent experience, or trying to design a conversation between people, which is essentially what it's coming down to, is how do you get trust with your client or customer? It's a very abstract problem to try to design, actually. What we learned with this project is that fundamentally, the whole bank needs to decide, `We're going to start to treat our customers in a different way, and we're going to try to meet their needs in this new way, and we've all decided to do this, and here are the way we're going to try to do it.` That would be the truly most successful outcome of that project, would have been, the whole bank says, `Hey, we've got a whole new way of talking and listening to our customers,` but in fact, that kind of initiative, that would be a pretty big deal for a very large bank to take on, everything from their outward-facing advertising down to how do their employees interact with their customers? Most organizations have undergone other initiatives like that, and also the market, in case you haven't been aware in the last couple years, has not been very good for banks, and so for them to focus on something other than the fact that the world's finances are going down the toilet No, I think they've been generally very successful, given the constraints. I mean, like with the customer service project with UBS, I mean, UBS is at the top of the list of banks that were in trouble for a while, and getting a lot of negative press, and in fact, still the most profitable bank in the world, but still getting a lot of negative press with the credit crunch and that kind of thing. The other thing that could be interesting that probably not a lot of people have talked to you about with UBS is that all along, all of our work with them, there's been this underlying interest in how do they become more innovative as an organization, and the problem is that banks are fundamentally not that innovative. They're about conservatism, especially a Swiss bank. It's about privacy and conservatism, and control, and innovation requires openness and things out of your control a little bit, and trying things before you know if they're successful. All of the attitudes about being creative are not very Swiss bank, basically. The overlap between those two is not big. All along they've been interested in being more innovative, and so all along we've learned from this series of projects about how they conduct their work and why they aren't creative like we are, because they are so driven by numbers. They're so driven by presumptions around numbers and business cases, and that kind of thing, and they don't really know how to quantify people needs and people attitudes and that kind of thing. Yeah, they do bring in people into the equation, but they use typical, traditional quantitative market research, where they try to take all of the nuances and complexities of people and turn them into statistics. `33.5% of people said that they might somewhat be more interested in investing more money, or would be interested in this kind of new credit card or that kind of new thing as well.` Well, the credit card project, let's see, here it was just a core team of four, and in terms of decision-makers, I guess just me as the project leader. When it comes down to it, the project manager is effectively making a lot of the decisions. Now I'm in the practice, so you can go to the practice for questions or support or guidance, if things are going wrong, but in general, you can take their advice or not. That sounds quite extreme, but that was a successful project, and the practice was very supportive, and so everything was going well, and nobody disagreed, so I guess in terms of decision-making, everybody was sort of in line with tone decision that we were making Well, the credit card project, let's see, here it was just a core team of four, and in terms of decision-makers, I guess just me as the project leader. When it comes down to it, the project manager is effectively making a lot of the decisions. Now I'm in the practice, so you can go to the practice for questions or support or guidance, if things are going wrong, but in general, you can take their advice or not. That sounds quite extreme, but that was a successful project, and the practice was very supportive, and so everything was going well, and nobody disagreed, so I guess in terms of decision-making, everybody was sort of in line with tone decision that we were making. Then with the client's side, we always had a very clear sponsor, the person who's paying for the work, but then underneath that was the group who was responsible for implementing credit cards, who didn't really feel comfortable that we were on their turf. I'd say that they weren't the official decision-maker on our project, but they would have a lot of influence, so I'm not quite sure exactly how you'd divide that. I mean, if somebody very senior says, `Thou shalt try this new credit card,` they would be like, `Sure, okay,` but in a real passive-aggressive kind of, `We're not going to put too many resources on it. We're not really going to provide you with any real data. We're not going to help you help us.` They can make a decision which is taken by somebody else not successful because they don't want to participate or collaborate. There were too many people who disagreed with the direction of that project, and so there was a lot of conflict in house. I haven't talked too much about that. I'm sure somebody else has, but there was a bit of conflict on that project internally at IDEO because it was very fuzzy. It wasn't really clear what we were going to deliver. The project manager tends to work in a very abstract, fuzzy, `The answer will come at some point,` kind of way, and then the other senior people on the project wanted to work in a more rigorous sort of, `Let's figure out what we need to get done and when,` kind of way, and those personalities clashed quite significantly on the project. I'm a huge fan of the embedded team member. They're difficult. They're a pain in the rear. They require a lot of hand-holding, especially at the beginning, and then especially at the end, when they were sort of mentally checking out from the project, but in the middle, I think they're one of the reasons our relationship with UBS has been as successful as it has been, because they, one-on-one, were able to see what it is that we do and how much passion we bring to the project work, and how we are working really collaboratively and strategically to help them be successful. And so in fact, they were quite passive-aggressive and negative clients, come to think of it, in terms of being supportive of our work, or giving us research information, that kind of thing. `What's going on here? Why are you bringing in a consultant? I'm doing my job just fine. We're making lots of money. We're successful. Why are you having someone come and innovate my area?` `We're going to start to treat our customers in a different way, and we're going to try to meet their needs in this new way, and we've all decided to do this, and here are the way we're going to try to do it.` why they aren't creative like we are, because they are so driven by numbers.   `Thou shalt try this new credit card,` they would be like, `Sure, okay,` but in a real passive-aggressive kind of, `We're not going to put too many resources on it. We're not really going to provide you with any real data.

    "text": "So it's pretty much contained to London at the moment. But, you know, a little while ago... just over a year ago, we were in a bit of a state and ideas have always been this kind like hard working, stay til midnight, designers in the zone kind of place. Which is really lovely and great when you're young and you don't have anything else to sort of look after. But people got to the point where they were sort of struggling a little bit, and it all kind of... I think there... we just had a series of projects that seemed to be really draining and then everyone fell apart a little bit and was like... oh God, you know... I haven't done my clothes washing for a month and like, I haven't eaten anything but takeaway, and I haven't been to the gym, and I never see my husband and like... and it just, I thought, there was obviously a need. And we've never really concentrated on a, kind of, HR or any kind of looking after people as a role very much. So... and I was doing, as I say, I started... it coincided with me being really interested in the gender and politics course. So I just sort of said, look, I'd be really interested to look at this. And the other thing that was a big trigger was, we've got so many women of childbearing age, which is now obvious, but at the time, none of them were pregnant. But there's this almost time bomb of sort of 30-odd year old women in the office getting booty. And we had no moms at all, and nobody making part-time work, or other responsibilities work. So it was like, oh shit, you know, we'd better look at how we can support people when they've got something really big going on in their life outside of work. And it started from there, and I just kind of did it... I took the idea process of kind of going out and gaining inspiration from people, and then sort of processing it and prototyping, and trying things. Went through the whole thing over the course of about, sort of, six to nine months. Then I... well, I guess I've kind of... because of my role in the Human Factors Team, I was... at the time, I was like team coordinator. And I also have quite good friendships with people here, it's very... I mean, you've probably picked up on that. It's like everyone's friends with each other. So we do talk about personal things. So, I picked up on it personally because... well, just, I've noticed that I didn't see as much of my friends, and I was often working late and sort of tired and stuff. But also, a lot of people had kind of talked to me about it from their perspective, and various people have been like, you know I'm sort of... times getting on and I'd like a family but I just don't know how I would cope and... you know, the anecdotal stuff they each have around the pub. But, it kind of all mounted up, and that's what was the trigger. And then, we kind of... I think the office just realized the leadership were really open to it, and I just kind of went and said, look I'd really like to run this project on work-life balance, and they were just so supportive and said, yeah let's do it, that's great. So I kind of formalized it a little bit more and gathered... sort of did basically what you're doing, that interview to sit loads of people, and processed it all. And then we had brainstorms which I deliberately kept it really, really open. I wanted it to be not at all exclusive. So I had brainstorms, and everyone in the office is invited. And if people with... loads of people came along, and we all kind of tackled ways of what... you know, supporting people with commitments outside of work, people you need to just put part-time, and blah, blah, blah. And then we... I kind of wrote up all of the brainstorm ideas, and we did a massive office voting system over a couple of weeks and then we picked the people that ideas that were the most... not only the most popular, but a bunch of us... myself, and the Location Lead and a couple of other people got together and worked out... we wanted to go for prevention rather than cure kind of method. So, we picked out the most popular, prevention, or kind of sustainable methods. We prototyped them on a live client project, which just wrapped up two weeks ago, and it was a huge success in pretty much all respects. Everything that we prototyped worked. I tracked the team over the course of the projects, and then checked in with them every week to find out what the kind of outputs of each little change were. And so, I kind of gathered all of that from a kind of human, personal point of view. And financially, the project pulled in a higher margin than we've done for a long, long time. So it was an overall huge success, and then presented that yesterday and it was really well received. So, it was great. Certainly in London, and... But across the board, all projects, yeah. And they said... they sort of said... the leadership said yesterday they wanted to start immediately. And I've been asked to stay in the role, and kind of be part of project kick offs, and checking in on teams, and reviewing, and that sort of thing, which is fantastic. Well I think, you know, it is obvious, but it was beneficial to everybody. It was definitely hard to do, there was... there have been some really key... like proper, cultural shifts that have needed to happen. But because they were for the benefit of everyone... I mean, it becomes almost cultish. You know, if you're kind of... it sounds really overdramatic, but people were a bit like... they kind of lost control a little bit and were sort of staying all hours, and didn't really have a personal life, and were traveling loads. Then, when... if somebody kind of... if you're like nominated to be on a prototype project, and that's fixed you become quite expressive about it. And so, the people here that were on the prototype project have been really kind of like, this has changed my life, I now see my friends, I go on holiday, it's great, I get eight hours sleep a night, and I'm really healthy. And that, I think, you can see that in your colleagues. You can see when they're happy, and healthy, and... So, I think it's quite infectious that way, which is great. But also I think, the... I can't really get away from... I've done so much looking into client organizations, and sort of research for work and for studies, into organizational behavior and I really have never seen a case where, if the leadership right at the top, support the idea, it works. And if they don't support the idea, it doesn't work. And I think that's what happened here, is... because we hit some hurdles when it wasn't so much on the kind of, table in the big board meetings. But it's... We've now, yesterday, pulled Bennett who's kind of the most influential guy in the office, kind of stood up and said this is great, this is exactly what we should be doing. And working late is so 80's, it's not cool, don't do it. And that's the thing that's going to make everybody not do it. Because the thing that was making everybody do it before was like, oh God, everyone is staying late, I've got to stay late. Otherwise, I'll look bad. Whereas the one kind of trigger from the person who they don't want to look bad to, is enough to make them think, okay, maybe if I do stay late he'll think I'm a dick. So, I think top-down support to genuine buy in from the leadership is what made it really successful. Well, I think it was... it's a very sensitive area, and it was highly emotional for a lot of people. And because we didn't have a kind of formalized, I guess, HR machine in this location previously, there was no... people didn't really have an outlet for their kind of angst about it, and their concerns. And so when we started it, it was the first time anyone had been given an opportunity to pour their heart out, so they did. So one of the first big hurdles was this huge outpouring of emotion. And then obviously... I mean, we say we're a flat hierarchy, but we're not. I don't think it would work if we were to totally flat, because we're too big. So, there's obvious... there is a kind of chain of responsibility, if you like. And if when the people at the bottom suddenly say, oh God, my life's a mess, this is so awful, work is ruining my life. Then the people up from them start to say, well that's not fair, you've never told me that, it's not my fault. And then the people up from there are like... so there was... it's very emotional I think. And there was a lot of... people had to work though this feeling responsible for each other, and sort of, this kind of blame. And everyone getting out their gripes about who stayed the latest, and who expected you to. And I think there was a... because of the way we've worked with... we have project teams and project leaders. And there's a hell of a lot of responsibility put onto the project leader. So when we had teams saying like, oh, I've worked on projects where I've been forced to stay 'til 11:00. We're a small enough office that everybody can work out quite quickly which those projects were, and who those Project Managers are. And then it's really horrible for them to have to deal with it, when nobody's been talking about it openly before. It just so happened that we were... I was the first person to say, let's talk about it. So there was definitely that. So, that was probably the biggest hurdle is making sure that people put aside their personal sort of hurt, or embarrassment, or discomfort and actually just [inaudible 00:19:02]. No blame, no sort of saying 'X' makes me stay until 11:00, whereas 'Y' is really good at everyone getting home at 6:00. Just forget about it and look at how everyone on the team can support each other. So that was the approach that we had to take. I think it required a bit of a shift in the respect. And then the other hurdle was, I think, as with any initiative and any organization, was time and resources. So it required a huge amount of my time. Absolutely enormous. And it became... it sort of felt really ironic at times that I was working late and tiring myself out on the Work-Life Balance Initiative. But it did, I mean it was so time-consuming. Because everyone... if you expect a culture to change, you have to sort of push, push, push, push, push at it the whole time until it does and then it can be self-sustaining. But there was a lot of the pushing work that took a lot of energy. And I had moments where I was like, forget it, I can't do it anymore. I'm not going to be the person who is pushing water up a hill. And then, just as I got to that point, I could make a little breakthrough and that would be what I needed to keep going, and keep going. And each extra person that bought into it and helped out, it got easier, and easier. I was the only full-time team member. After some... one of my mini kind of, 'I'm packing it in' breakdowns, there was a Service... their Service Practice Lead, Fran, was kind of just stuck her hand up and said that she would be high-level support. So I knew I could go to her at anytime and say, look, Fran, nobody's listening, nobody's doing this, we need to do this. And she would be the kind of, the heavy. Say, you gotta do this. And then, that was it. Although, as I say, as it went along we did... we made it as open an inclusive as possible so that people could kind of express their input. That's just important. oh God, you know... I haven't done my clothes washing for a month and like, I haven't eaten anything but takeaway, and I haven't been to the gym, and I never see my husband and like... and it just, I thought, there was obviously a need. So I had brainstorms, and everyone in the office is invited. And if people with... loads of people came along, and we all kind of tackled ways of what... you know, supporting people with commitments outside of work, people you need to just put part-time, and blah, blah, blah.

    "text": "So, in terms of the end result, I think at the end of the project when we delivered, I was no longer on the project team. But when the Project Manager took the output to the client, they were... the client was happy. But throughout it, it was what we call a really foggy project  So, for me, the biggest thing to sum up why it didn't go well is nobody knew what we were trying to do. And that was the sort of... we had... it was limited in time, it was shorter than we would normally be used to working and I think it was about six or seven weeks in total. And we genuinely didn't know what we were expected to output, and there was a kind of communication breakdown within the team, and it all got a bit ridiculous. So, for me, the biggest thing to sum up why it didn't go well is nobody knew what we were trying to do.

And we genuinely didn't know what we were expected to output, and there was a kind of communication breakdown within the team, and it all got a bit ridiculous. You know, everyone has their person who they turn to at work I think, I had sort of that someone in particular who I could confide in, who is senior to me, so she helps me in situations like that. So I was going to her and saying, I don't know what I'm doing and time is ticking on and I'm finding it really hard to extract this information from the PM, or if he doesn't know, from the client. And then other people on the team were going to their person, and sort of saying the same thing. So there ended up being a couple of senior people looking into it going, what's going on here? And then it became a sort of... it was just a bit silly, you know. There were people popping in left, right and center to try and rescue the project and this is still very stressful. It wasn't enough clarity around what was... you know, I work much better when I know... you know, tell me how long I've got, and what I have to do by the end of it and then I'll break it down into chunks and work my way through it. If you don't tell me exactly what I have to do by then end of it, then I feel nervous when people kind of drip feed me tasks to do, but I can't see where that task is leading to, so I don't... and I think that was the problem. Certainly for me, and I know definitely team members of the team who felt the same way.  I think there was also a slight issue with the Project Manager, and his working style is to hold things in his own head, and he's definitely faced communication problems with team members before. I know... and he's a lovely guy, that the... but he's not the best person at sharing information and helping people kind of see where it's going. I think he held on little bit too much to his knowledge of the project. And kind of, he would contact the client, and he would know exactly what was going on, and he would... I think... I don't know if he thought he was feeding back pretty clearly to us, but in reality, from my perspective, he wasn't. So there became a kind of internal tension there, as well. I think there was also a slight issue with the Project Manager, and his working style is to hold things in his own head, and he's definitely faced communication problems with team members before.

I don't know if he thought he was feeding back pretty clearly to us, but in reality, from my perspective, he wasn't. So there became a kind of internal tension there, as well. I think there was a combination of things. I think it... the project itself was genuinely unclear, like the client kept chopping and changing their mind. I think there was also a slight issue with the Project Manager, and his working style is to hold things in his own head, and he's definitely faced communication problems with team members before.

I don't know if he thought he was feeding back pretty clearly to us, but in reality, from my perspective, he wasn't. So there became a kind of internal tension there, as well. I think... I don't know how to put this without being a bit... I don't want to be unprofessional. But I personally find it quite important to trust and respect in people who are perceived to be senior to me in making decisions, and I didn't necessarily feel like that. I've since... we've since made a huge effort to kind of work out how to work better together, and I think he has with some of the other people on the team as well. But at the time, I was kind of thinking, I don't really know what I'm doing, but I don't really trust that he knows what he's doing, and he's not giving me the right sort of information. So there was a little bit of a breakdown in... I guess, I suppose trust is probably... Trust and communication. Again, that wasn't clear. And I think that lead to a little bit of... I suppose, hostility to the people who scoped it. So we were thinking kind of the whole time... it was like, I don't know what I'm doing. And also, who the hell told the client we could do this in six weeks? So that was a second kind of background question going through our already stressed and slightly angry minds. So I'm not sure, actually. I still to this day don't know who scoped it, but I know that if I was somebody put in scoping then I would definitely not have scoped it with the resources that we had available. . And I don't know whether it was the Practice Lead that scoped it on his own, or the PM that scoped it on his own, or somebody else. But, whoever it was, I don't think it was done in a malicious way. And I think it's more important to raise the flag that the scoping was wrong, than to kind of find out who scoped it and berate them. Well, no. I think it sort of... it's unclear. I mean, you don't want to push [inaudible 00:28:39] too far. I tried not to let things get too personal, and it's a small office and I have sense that it was possibly scoped, like... it's been a stressful time work-wise. We've been desperately trying to get work in, and I think it was one of those, shit, we're just gonna have to get this working any way we can. And I don't know whether it was the Practice Lead that scoped it on his own, or the PM that scoped it on his own, or somebody else. But, whoever it was, I don't think it was done in a malicious way. And I think it's more important to raise the flag that the scoping was wrong, than to kind of find out who scoped it and berate them. Well for me, I went outside of the project team. It was quite stressful. I was... I'm quite close to one of the other people that was on the project, and I know... and he found it, I think, even harder than I did. So, within the project, while I was finding it really difficult, I also felt like I was slightly supporting him. So for my own support, I went outside of the project team to somebody who I trusted implicitly and had worked with before, really successfully, who is quite senior in the organization and respected, and I knew would kind of tell me honestly what I needed to do, and would help me. So, I just went to her, and sort of talked to her on a regular basis. Talked it through, explained what the problems were, and she kind of dropped in when she could. Like luckily, she in the sort of role where she can drop into projects, and she kind of cold came in and tried to figure out direction for us and help us. So, that's how I tried to cope with it. And then also, this other guy on the project and I decided after the whole project was over, that we wanted to feedback to the Location Head, and one of the Design Directors, because we felt like it was important that we get out our concerns so that the scoping and the team make-up and stuff, we didn't just face the same issue over again. And I felt quite like I had a responsibility, really. I don't think you should sort of sit around slagging everything off, and then not try to do something about it. Yeah, so, in all honestly I think the Project Manager held onto most of the content, and certainly all of the client contact. So I actually, genuinely, to this day so don't know what was finally delivered, and how. But I suspect most of it came from him, directly to the client, and they were happy. I think he was possibly more aligned with what the client was wanting than we were at any point, so he was in a position to deliver that, and couldn't seem to get us on board. So I felt... I felt quite excluded from what was delivered. But, by that point, I was just quick to get off the project, so I wasn't struggling to be involved. I was just like, whatever. Just as long as I don't have to be there. I think it does, I really do. I think it's so hard, and I'm just going to have to be brutally honest, but that I try really hard to sort of approach everything with the same openness. But if I, you know, I struggle to work with this person still, and I'm naturally... you know, if I've been on a project team with someone and I've had a really successful collaboration with them, and really enjoyed it, and I felt like it's worked really nicely, when we have to work together in the future and they come to me with something, I'm in problem solving mode. So it's like, yes, let's do it. You know, we'll work together and we'll get it done. But, I wouldn't really say that was kind of... that... I know there are other people who I've sort of chatted to who are genuinely quite afraid of being stuck working with some people, which I think is a really bad way to go into a project. And I think that comes back to the trust thing as well. I think you can... I can certainly see it more in project teams where the people on the team have previously worked together, and it's been good. I think, sort of, just in my own experience, I see... when people have worked together before and it's been bad, they're going to the next project all feeling a little bit tense, or there's sort of emotions already high, or it's a little bit like... Mmm. But they kind of just get on and do it, and the looks like a normal project. Apart from a project like that, where it goes totally tits up. Whereas, I think you can really see the project teams where I say their work is outstanding, and they push the boundaries. You know, they'll sort of fit in a lot more, or do something really unusual, or produce something really outstanding. They tend to be teams where they've worked together before, and it's almost like they've done the groundwork of building up the trust, and the kind of collaborating. And then they can take what they produced on the last project and use that, kind of, already knitted sense to make something great. So, there's a couple of projects where they've obviously been a huge success, either in terms of team wellbeing and satisfaction, which for me is as important as client... or in terms of the output being just the most brilliant design, or beautiful thing or whatever. And I think that's where you really see it. Like you can... I can look in my head at most of those projects and say, yeah I think that's because those two work together on the previous one, so they were already in that sort of nice way of working together. Then I think it's harder to spot, because there's a certain... think that's what kind of goes on in people's heads, behind the scenes. So, maybe it just becomes a little bit more stressful, and I think the output tends to be... I don't think the actual kind of content output of the project is necessarily bad because of it, but I'd say it's probably more mediocre. You know, you haven't got that room, and that sort of freedom to be really, really, creative when you're emotionally not as comfortable as you would like to be. I think that's how it shows. No, higher up people, the resourcing team, wanted continuity for the client because obviously it looks better for them, and they're holding the knowledge and they all said no way. I mean there's some people who were kind of saying, look, I'm really sorry but I'm going to leave if you put me on the next project with that client. So, I think it's very much the same, and I think that you have the same trust things. You know, if you've... probably comes from the client as much as, if not more so than IDEO. Like if they've had a project with a team, and the output of the project has been great, and it's sort of taken hold internally in their organization, and they feel that trust, then they're going to be much more open to pushing the boundaries on the next project. So I think it's pretty similar, actually, with clients. In house, it would have originally just have been the PM and the practice person. But because it all went so badly wrong on the team, then each person on the team was pulling in their most trusted person from the Leadership and there became a few people calling the shots. Like, maybe, three more people coming in and... I don't know if I'd necessarily call them decision makers, but their influence was greater than the PM's. And... but that was just towards the end, when we all waived the flag and said, what the hell's going on? Initially, I don't think there was a huge... you know, it... we didn't really go into it with a sort of massive network of decision makers to navigate. I don't think that was ever really a hurdle. It became, sort of, part of the problem towards the end. But, there wasn't a sort of terrible organizational map all over the place or anything. I don't know. I mean, I know there was a key client, but I don't know where they sat within the organization. Whether they were kind of taking what we told them, and taking it to other internal decision makers, I've no idea. But that could've been the cause of the fog, actually. I mean, in my experience it quite often is. But, I don't know. Unsuccessful. There wasn't really a process. It would be... it was... very badly handled, on all parts, including mine. And it kind of got to the point where there was just a lot of emotional baggage going along with the questions. So, I was trying to find out what the hell I needed to do, but I was in that. There was like, accusations from me and from everybody else that it was somebody's fault that we didn't know how to do... you know, what we needed to do. So, it became kind of like quite [inaudible 00:44:47]. And we would be like, look I've got no idea what's going on. And then, the guy would be like, well, we don't know either. And then there'd be kind of a series of little explosive moments, and then various people going off and crying, and coming back, and there's so many tears on that project. It was like living in a soap opera. And then the end result is, I still don't know what the brief was. And we genuinely didn't know what we were expected to output, and there was a kind of communication breakdown within the team, and it all got a bit ridiculous. But throughout it, it was what we call a really foggy project. So, for me, the biggest thing to sum up why it didn't go well is nobody knew what we were trying to do. I don't know what I'm doing and time is ticking on and I'm finding it really hard to extract this information from the PM, or if he doesn't know, from the client. And then other people on the team were going to their person, and sort of saying the same thing. So there ended up being a couple of senior people looking into it going, what's going on here?

I don't think you should sort of sit around slagging everything off, and then not try to do something about it. So we arranged that meeting with them, talked it all through with them, and they were great. Really good. And, so they just... so, they were very open to our feedback, and kind of had a kind of a... how can we solve it sort of approach, rather than a... who's to blame, or how dare you sort of approach. Which I think is what you need. But, by that point, I was just quick to get off the project, so I wasn't struggling to be involved. I was just like, whatever. Just as long as I don't have to be there. When somebody who I've had a negative experience with come to me and says, we need to do this, I'm in much more like... no, kind of. And I try not to be in that kind of... I have to kind of take myself off for a moment, and think, well, you know, probably could be done. It's not ideal, it's not the way I would've done it, but sort of, we'll do it anyway. I know there are other people who I've sort of chatted to who are genuinely quite afraid of being stuck working with some people, which I think is a really bad way to go into a project. And I think that comes back to the trust thing as well.   I think, sort of, just in my own experience, I see... when people have worked together before and it's been bad, they're going to the next project all feeling a little bit tense, or there's sort of emotions already high, or it's a little bit like  think if... I mean, we had an experience with UBS, where a team worked on phase one of a project and it was awful, and that was for internal reasons. Actually, with the same guy as the other project that I talked about. But also, client reasons. The client was embedded, and worked full-time at IDEO and it was very stressful. And then, we got to the end of that project and no one from the project team would go onto the next phase. And they... they just said... look, I'm really sorry but I'm going to leave if you put me on the next project with that client.",

    "text": "I would say, actually, from an overall success, definitely the project we just did went very well. The chairman of the client was thrilled. The team was one of the largest the office has ever had to work together in. And we covered so much ground in such a short period of time that overall, it definitely was painful at parts, but it definitely was a success. And everyone on the team learned quite a bit from it and grew quite a bit, I think. Well I think it's, for me, it's the type of project that helps IDEO expand and grow. It's the type of project that teaches IDEO something too. So IDEO's done a lot of projects. And there are a lot of projects they've done that are quite similar to other projects they've done. And there seems to be quite a distinct pattern in team size and project length. It's always three person teams for three months. I mean, that's like the magic formula it feels. This broke that a lot. And it didn't just break it because it was seven full time people for 17 weeks. But it broke it because it was by definition, a team with, I don't even think, only two people who are the same nationality out of the seven. Three offices, and just about every, it covered just about every core service practice area of expertise that IDEO has. So we dealt with space, we dealt with product, we dealt with service, we dealt with interface. We dealt with communications, then we dealt with organizational factors. So that, to me, that kind of size, breadth and depth is not something IDEO does every day. And it's a truly global client, five to 10 year relationship. Different dynamic, different kind of thing. So that's why I think it was quite successful is that we pulled it off. The client is coming to us with a lot more work and we're starting to now think about how we road map and manage and navigate with a client that size of an engagement. So I think that's quite a huge step for IDEO. The challenges with that one are IDEO is also very flat and the too many chefs in the kitchen thing happened, I think, a lot. Everyone's got an opinion and there was a general feeling that consensus was needed before moving on. So everyone gets consulted on every issue. And there was a lot of time spent debating and discussing things that probably didn't really need that kind of intensity. Certainly not when the client was comfortable with us moving forward on a direction, we were more on a lower level arguing, not really for a reason that was good for the client. But the client's paying for that. And then I just think we have challenges with foreign clients, just the whole dealing with a Chinese client, translation, cultural differences, understanding how to present to a Chinese client. Really ramping up our capabilities and understanding what translation time is needed, how to use the room how the hierarchy, pecking order of the people who are sitting there. I think that could have been managed a lot differently Their ability to comment when they're invited to comment, what we're asking them to approve, not being confrontational in dialogue. All of that stuff, we learned along the way, but really we shouldn't be at that level with that size of a project, learning that along the way. We should have some of that at the more senior level already nailed. So the junior people can learn, but that felt a bit, that was risky, even though we pulled it off. And then yeah, I guess, I think we waited too long to really do the design, the think, build, build, think. So we did it, but we didn't do it on day one. We overthought the problem, I think, a bit. And in overthinking the problem, had to rethink it before we could ... It paralyzed the team in terms of build. And no one felt ready to start building because we were really bogged down in discussing the strategy and we needed to just making stuff sooner. So we go crunched of course for time and all that at the end. It's my first IDEO project. I've been at IDEO for three and a half months now. And the whole time, it's been on this project. So we dealt with space, we dealt with product, we dealt with service, we dealt with interface. We dealt with communications, then we dealt with organizational factors. So that, to me, that kind of size, breadth and depth is not something IDEO does every day. Everyone's got an opinion and there was a general feeling that consensus was needed before moving on.

    "text": "Feed Me Bottles, I think you spoke to Lucy, as well. Yeah, that went well enough for multiple reasons. On a person thing, I'm very much of instant gratification. And this was a six weeks project, and it was full paced, like we couldn't have worked any quicker, we didn't work stupid hours or stuff, we'd go home around sort of half six every night, but in those hours, everything was condensed. It was like two weeks observation, two weeks ideas, two weeks execution. And this was a six weeks project, and it was full paced, like we couldn't have worked any quicker, we didn't work stupid hours or stuff, we'd go home around sort of half six every night, but in those hours, everything was condensed. It was like two weeks observation, two weeks ideas, two weeks execution. And it was sort of bang, bang, bang done. And it was an interesting project because it's so short that everything has to run alongside each other, so you've got the human factors with the branding, with the sort of communication of it, we even went down to sort of adverts and suggestions for advertising. And the business plan, as well. We had a business factor working with us, so because of that, everything was working sort of empowered with each other, and that sort of put a thread throughout it all and tied it all in. And we think it came out really nicely executed at the end. For me, that was a great project, because we had an awesome deliverable at the end. If you ... Quite often you see projects where ... I mean, not so much IDEO, but quite often you can see things where they're sort of mix-matched and the product's been designed, then the brand's been designed, and something else has been sort of ... That just has to keep the same logo, or they've got some brand values that tie in together roughly, where this was just really different, the fact that everything usually and in any company, you'd have a brand and then you'd design a new product, but the fact that the company was being ... The brand of the company was being built alongside the product means that everything reinforces each other, which is nice. And we think it came out really nicely executed at the end. For me, that was a great project, because we had an awesome deliverable at the end. In terms of what was interesting about it, I don't know if you ... We took a seven percent share in that company in exchange, obviously. So that was interesting, the fact that we were almost ... To a degree, we were the client, as well. So, because we own seven percent of the company, so it went really well. And I was dubious at first as to how that was gonna work, whether we would try and override, because quite often if you get a tricky client, and you sort of have to work out with them, I didn't know if we would be sort of trying to override those with us owning seven percent, or just how mentally you'd get your brain around the idea that if I liked this, and the client didn't, then how ... What would we pursue, then? But it worked really well, it was just things though, the client and naturally we designed to the best of our ability, so it was irrelevant as to whether we liked it, they liked it, we were always both gonna like it. So, yes, so that was interesting. And the sort of, say, merging everything together, of never sort of really heard of the product. I mean [inaudible 00:09:36]. But I've never heard of a project where everything sort of been designed from scratch. Even down to the final thing we passed over last week was the director's business cards and stuff that we designed, so it was like stationary, even throwing in at the end But it worked really well, it was just things though, the client and naturally we designed to the best of our ability, so it was irrelevant as to whether we liked it, they liked it, we were always both gonna like it.

But I've never heard of a project where everything sort of been designed from scratch. Even down to the final thing we passed over last week was the director's business cards and stuff that we designed, so it was like stationary, even throwing in at the end. There's been a shift, sort of more recently, to sort of make things a lot more tangible. Like you'll see a lot of projects print posters rather than do projected presentations, and just makes things tangible, get things on the table, and this was interesting, because in London, we don't really design stuff ... We're not known for a huge amount of project design like Munich and Palo Alto sort of do that, and we do product design comes into occasionally, but it's more in terms of deliverables. Because this was a staff project, so we had like models made and we had foam models and then we had aesthetic models done, from prototypers, and that was really interesting, just seeing people get really revved up and excited about it. Like Suzie was on the project, she's been here for sort of ... 20 years, or something like that. A long, long time. And she's sort of an engineer by training, and she was saying, that it was great to see people's faces like they used to when stuff would come into the office and people would wow, look at this, look at this. Because usually we have like a folder or a poster or something like that, sort of stuff. So sort of stuff's changed. So that was really interesting, really tangible product, in terms of human factor side of it as well. Bringing in the users, that was interesting, because we had foam, so each bottle we designed, we had a foam mock-up made and the users could try that, and it was interesting seeing the different, in terms of users holding a bottle and using a sort of testing, imaging it with a foam bottle, as opposed to looking at a poster, being like, yeah, I like that, it's all right. No, I wouldn't buy that one, it's yellow or something like that. There's probably rarely more than three or four people full-time. Which is also a great thing as well, because it was just really easy to make decisions, it wasn't a women's institute conference, every afternoon discussing what we should do. it wasn't a women's institute conference, every afternoon discussing what we should do. It was like, should we do this? Yeah, okay, let's do that. So, if the team was any bigger, we'd have struggled to get the project done in such a small amount of time. I think because we just had to trust each other and sort of trust their views and opinions. So, if the team was any bigger, we'd have struggled to get the project done in such a small amount of time. I think because we just had to trust each other and sort of trust their views and opinions. But in terms of different projects, I think it's certainly very talked about, because it's a totally different way of doing things, like, we're taking equity instead of money, which is obviously one of the key things. But also, we're designing a company, sort of semi from scratch. I mean, they came to us with the technology, but we've done the brand, and so our deliverable was their pitch to sort of the John Lewises and all this stuff, rather than usually we do a presentation saying, this is what we did, and this is how we got there. Instead it was like, this is what Feed Me is, and it was a totally sort of modular pitch that we give to them. And we were basically, it was great, because we were sort of all empowered the make the decisions in the different areas, so I was dealing with sort of prototyping and production, all the makers, and whatnot. And then so the other guy was doing to final catch, Lucy was doing the ... So we'd throw something in and say, what do you think about this, and then we'd make the decision. . And we were basically, it was great, because we were sort of all empowered the make the decisions in the different areas, so I was dealing with sort of prototyping and production, all the makers, and whatnot. And then so the other guy was doing to final catch, Lucy was doing the ... So we'd throw something in and say, what do you think about this, and then we'd make the decision. But also, so you'd always check your decision, but at the same time, it was a group decision and you always felt like you could just make a decision on your own and that was trusted as well. So if something didn't work, you'd change it, offer it out to the table, and you'd be done. So I know that doesn't really answer your question of a number. They were quite open to it. Because again, because we ... Well, not invested, per se, because we didn't actually give them any money. Because we had a stake in equity in the company, they were quite open to it, and it got to a stage towards the end where Jim, the director, would just say to us, well, what do you think, should we do it, what do you think? And we sort of became the empowered decision makers, and he'd come back to us with light ideas that some of his engineers would have, and like, what do you we think about this, are users gonna want it? It's sort of ... The trust seemed to be there, certainly my from being in the first meeting I was, it was just three meetings down the road, the trust was sort of instilled in us in the beginning, it felt that way, at least. So seeing as we explained sort of our process and how we speak to users, and we were gonna bring in these sort of eight to 10 key users, which were in their demographic, and we'd basically just sit down, hang out, and talk to them and find out what they wanted, and test our ideas against that. So they came to us, this huge bottle. It was only a nine ounce bottle, a standard bottle, but it was the size of a pint glass, and this thing was just colossally huge, and really rather phallic as well. And didn't go down a storm with the parents, when we showed them that, and we suggested that they were gonna put that in their child's mouth. So, we sort of flagged up our concerns around this design, and they were aware of the concerns, as well. But it was a key, that was key to getting the engineering right, and then they came to us, and they were like, it sort of works now, can you make it? But it was supposed to be a [inaudible 00:23:52] but it works now, so can you make it look pretty? And we were like no. We need to change a few things. So for one, this has 15 parts, it needs to have four. So 15 is an exaggeration, but it was probably pushing close to 10. So we shed some parts, which they were really chuffed about, because that sheds cost. They were very cost-sensitive throughout, as well. So, yeah, so as soon as we said, oh, we're going to speak to users and see what they think, and then they were more than open, sort of trust started them. And the fact that we wouldn't just make rash decisions, we'd contact Jim or who their engineers, and double check with them, that A, it would work, because there's no point designing something like, this wasn't the concept, this is something we want to take straightaway to market. So I think it was a good balance sort of between us doing our work and also referencing them. That was quite often, well, not quite often, it was often difficult because so ... Obviously originally we expected to be like sort of a skin job, so they came in with this technology, we designed the bottle, dropped it. And that wasn't to be the case, because we soon found out beyond that this thing was too big, and if it went to market size, it wasn't gonna sell. These required ... So, it became sort of a bit of strip it back, and then redesign a bit, but the client was more than open to ... Like I said, they were aware of it, as well. So, they sort of threw an engineer our way for a few days, and we sort of liaised with him, and checked with him what we could do. And in the end we got sort of a ten percent scale reduction in volume, and decisions like this, which sort of were made quite well together. But, like I say, in terms of deliverable, we knew we had to present a brand, and we knew we had to come up with a bottle, so it was quite clear from the start what it was we were doing. And then it just came down to what we could get in the time, so originally it was set up to plan the bottle and then a range of accessories, sort of bags that sterilize. And then it was clear when we had to take on this extra engineering that it wasn't gonna happen. But the client, again, was more than open to that. They were aware that this was a six week product and they were happy for us to do as much as we could in six weeks. I mean, the key thing was, after the second week, we basically nailed the key thing was the vision, so we wanted to have a great looking brand, and a great looking product, and that was the vision, so if there were a couple of engineering faults that needed to be ironed out, that was fine. The other thing was, because this was a new company, we'd be trying to design alongside their engineers, so we'd be allowing and sort of presuming that this would work. So we'd start designing, say, okay, so it has to come out of a vent, and it has this colic thing. Fine. Like, Lucy's a legend anyways, so she's very ... I can't think of the word. The word's not headstrong, but she's very driven, so she knew ... We all knew that we needed a pack and a brand, and the bottle, and we knew that's what we wanted, and it was just a case of how can we get there? So I think Lucky quite often had difficulty in trying to run a project and do half of the deliverables all at the same time Yeah, there was no tricky relationships. Near the end, the district designer came over from Munich, so there was a few culture differences and stuff at first, but there was nothing hugely difficult. It was just what you'd expect in any normal project. Well, they're self-ironing. So, if people come from different offices and different things are done differently at different offices, like, you've probably found this, like London, I think from what ... I mean, I've not been to any other offices. But I get the impression that London's a lot more laid back office than some of the other places. And we're also a lot more sort of open, so we're a lot more transparent, and we know how much money the office is making, where the money's going, what the pipeline is, what decisions have been made by partners. We're more than aware of all of this, which isn't often the case. everything was working sort of empowered with each other, and that sort of put a thread throughout it all and tied it all in. And it was sort of bang, bang, bang done. And it was an interesting project because it's so short that everything has to run alongside each other, so you've got the human factors with the branding, with the sort of communication of it, we even went down to sort of adverts and suggestions for advertising The brand of the company was being built alongside the product means that everything reinforces each other, which is nice. But it worked really well, it was just things though, the client and naturally we designed to the best of our ability, so it was irrelevant as to whether we liked it, they liked it, we were always both gonna like it. Bringing in the users, that was interesting, because we had foam, so each bottle we designed, we had a foam mock-up made and the users could try that, and it was interesting seeing the different, in terms of users holding a bottle and using a sort of testing, imaging it with a foam bottle, as opposed to looking at a poster, being like, yeah, I like that, it's all right. No, I wouldn't buy that one, it's yellow or something like that. So the difference in terms of opinion by the tangible, in terms of the procedure was quite interesting. I think because we just had to trust each other and sort of trust their views and opinions. It was like, should we do this? Yeah, okay, let's do that. So, if the team was any bigger, we'd have struggled to get the project done in such a small amount of time. But in terms of the sort of actual tangible, when you give it to them in a magazine, so like the final ad sets we put in a magazine, then the context has changed, they're no longer focused on this one A3 sheet on the wall that we're gonna make them look at and talk about. They all sort of picked up this bottle, and then sort of imagined their kid was there, and were like, yeah, that feels awkward, that feels a bit too heavy, and stuff. And they all like voted, oh, we love that, we love that, we love that. And then we sort of passed the bottle around, and they had it in this thing, it was like huge, because on the image it looked fine, then when they held it, and then they sort of sleek design that we had going on, then suddenly, and you sort of had your bottle cap coming out of here, suddenly when they held this, and they'd sort of taken the cap off and they'd held it, they were like, oh, it feels like it's slipping out of my hand. So the perception was all like, oh, that is beautiful, and sleek, and then they hold it, and the practicality's over, this feels like it would slip out of my hand. So, in terms of its scale and size, money-wise it's quite hard to value. But in terms of different projects, I think it's certainly very talked about, because it's a totally different way of doing things, like, we're taking equity instead of money, which is obviously one of the key things. But also, we're designing a company, sort of semi from scratch. it was great, because we were sort of all empowered the make the decisions in the different areas, so I was dealing with sort of prototyping and production, all the makers, and whatnot. But also, so you'd always check your decision, but at the same time, it was a group decision and you always felt like you could just make a decision on your own and that was trusted as well.

So, yeah, so as soon as we said, oh, we're going to speak to users and see what they think, and then they were more than open, sort of trust started them we'd be trying to design alongside their engineers, And they agreed to do that, that was fine, but they said, we don't know about [inaudible 00:28:22], we might need to go back to the valve. But their vision was that we wouldn't have this extra component, it would be built into the teat. So, we designed to that, and then two weeks later, they go, oh, it's fine, we spoke to the patents office and we can get away with it. So as long as we justified decisions, like I say, in terms of the scheduling and stuff, everything kind of fell bang on because we knew what we were doing and when it was gonna be there.   the industrial designer's who's doing the CAD would email his CAD guy, and he was very sort of open, and you could sort of send anything. And if you had a question, it wasn't like, oh we need to try and work out, we don't want to lose faith, it was like, okay, let's get it sorted. Near the end, the district designer came over from Munich, so there was a few culture differences and stuff at first, I mean, I've not been to any other offices. But I get the impression that London's a lot more laid back office than some of the other places",

    "text": "I've only been at IDEO ... I joined a year last July. So this isn't the best time, project-wise, obviously, so I couldn't probably tell I've only been on three projects, and I was very fortunate that they were three very good projects that all went really well, so- Yeah, so, in terms of the Havaianas footwear, that was tricky because like I say, they were ... Havaianas is obviously based in Brazil, so that was quite a pain in the out-start. Because it wasn't feasible to fly the whole team out there for presentations and whatnot, so-  Havaianas is obviously based in Brazil, so that was quite a pain in the out-start. Because it wasn't feasible to fly the whole team out there for presentations and whatnot, so- But it wasn't feasible to fly the whole project out there, so there'd be like, Ingrid, who's a project leader at that time, and Miguel, who's the senior designer. So they'd go out there and then they'd come back and it'd be a case of them having to reiterate to the design team what their decisions were and whether they liked it or not. So that's always tricky, trying to remember everything that was said over meetings which lasted sort of a week long.  There was also a lot of issues ... It was our second project with Havaianas, the first project was a range of bags that we'd done for them. That I was on that as well, so that was quite hard, because one project finished and then there was a certain couple of weeks, and then the next project started. So it was very tricky in terms of ... The bags project hadn't sort of totally finished, because that was going through engineering and manufacturer, so it was quite often at the stat of the footwear, you'd be trying to get bags to finish near phone calls and clients, clients and engineers saying, oh, what about this? And then we'd have to re-spec something, but Miguel would be too busy trying to get the footwear stuff done. So I'd be having to like do a design spec document, but then also falling back on the sandals, so the initial sort of crossover stage of that was hard. It was also hard because Ingrid was controlling the crossover, sort of going through the production of the bags. This was a key product as well, because it was one of the first things that was going to go to market from IDEO for quite a while, so it was all guns blazing to get that through. So Ingrid was sort of fighting her battles and sort of sorting all that out. Which meant that Miguel sort of ... Miguel who's one of the designers, he sort of took over the project manager role of the sandals, which he sort of stepped up a bit, and then he was sort of doing things that you weren't so much used to doing, because it wasn't tricky things, but there was a bit of a blur between who was project manager and whatnot. It was just the crossover phase that was tricky there. And also Ingrid was sort of keeping the client relationship going, so there was less time for project managing and there was a lot of things. And this was November and December last year, which I think were the busiest months I've ever been in IDEO history. Everybody was working 140%, if such a thing exists. And we just made those, and that was when ... So after that point, prototyping really came in, I think it sort of dwindled, from what people were saying. It sort of dwindled off when we sort of got into this, and also electronic presentations and then prototyping really came back then. And that was, sort of decision made to start going down the process route, and sort of tangible processes you'd take and put up and talk around you, rather than sit in a dark room staring at a projector screen. Yeah, it went well, because like I said, everyone just sort of stepped up a notch. Ingrid was still sort of project manager, but for quick questions and just general discussion around design, you just went to sort of Miguel, and everyone sort of, literally, Ingrid sort of popped off and was controlling all of it. And then just had a new deputy project manager- Well, Miguel and Ingrid were the classic pair, like, Miguel was sort of ... On every project, it'd be, if Ingrid was on the project, it'd be Miguel. They were like a team. They were like ... So the trust is inevitably there, I mean Miguel moved over from the London office to work with ... From the Munich office to the London office to work with Ingrid more on projects, so I understand, so there was no worries about trusting them. Miguel was sort of ... On every project, it'd be, if Ingrid was on the project, it'd be Miguel. They were like a team. They were like ... So the trust is inevitably there, I mean Miguel moved over from the London office to work with ... From the Munich office to the London office to work with Ingrid more on projects, so I understand, so there was no worries about trusting them. And then we all got along really well with Ingrid and stuff as well, so that wasn't an issue. Like I said, the trust was there, so with in terms of the flip flops, Miguel and Ingrid went over to Brazil, and that left me, and another guy, so we'd only ... This was like our first full-time project at IDEO after being sort of interns over the summer. And Ingrid left us and was like, yeah, just design. So you in a week when we come back. And she just turned us over, do our own thing, don't bother ringing me, just do stuff. And she opened up the floor to us when she came back in a week, and we'd made sort of a hundred pairs of different flip flops, and we'd structured the project, and we came out of sort of areas where we thought we could design to. And that was great, because she just empowered us, sort of two junior designers to just do whatever, how we want. And that worked really well, and that's when the prototyping thing really started to come through, because within a day we realized there was no point drawing a flip flop, because it would just look like that. So they'd go out there and then they'd come back and it'd be a case of them having to reiterate to the design team what their decisions were and whether they liked it or not. So that's always tricky, trying to remember everything that was said over meetings which lasted sort of a week long. The bags project hadn't sort of totally finished, because that was going through engineering and manufacturer, so it was quite often at the stat of the footwear, you'd be trying to get bags to finish near phone calls and clients, clients and engineers saying, oh, what about this? And then we'd have to re-spec something, but Miguel would be too busy trying to get the footwear stuff done. because it was one of the first things that was going to go to market from IDO for quite a while, so it was all guns blazing to get that through. Miguel who's one of the designers, he sort of took over the project manager role of the sandals, which he sort of stepped up a bit, and then he was sort of doing things that you weren't so much used to doing, because it wasn't tricky things, but there was a bit of a blur between who was project manager and whatnot. It was just the crossover phase that was tricky there. And this was November and December last year, which I think were the busiest months I've ever been in IDO history. Everybody was working 140%, if such a thing exists. Actually there was me and another two designers. Excuse me, we'd just churn out hundreds of pairs of flip flops, there's a photo at the end of just flip flops all in a row that we've made in the foyer, taken from the top floor, and it's just like, sort of filling this room, flip flop by flip flop. Well, that was good, that was one of the first really hands-on project. So with the bags, we had a seamstress in who was sort of making the bags as we were going along, sort of mocking up and trying things out. So a lot of things ... And we started doing sort of brainstorms which were sort of body storms, ctually there was me and another two designers. Excuse me, we'd just churn out hundreds of pairs of flip flops, there's a photo at the end of just flip flops all in a row that we've made in the foyer, taken from the top floor, and it's just like, sort of filling this room, flip flop by flip flop. So the trust is inevitably there, I mean Miguel moved over from the London office to work with Well, Miguel and Ingrid were the classic pair, like, Miguel was sort of ... On every project, it'd be, if Ingrid was on the project, it'd be Miguel. They were like a team. Like I said, the trust was there, so with in terms of the flip flops And she just turned us over, do our own thing, don't bother ringing me, just do stuff. we'd structured the project, and we came out of sort of areas where we thought we could design to. And that was great, because she just empowered us   we'd structured the project, and we came out of sort of areas where we thought we could design to. And that was great, because she just empowered us,",

    "text": "I think a project that went really well was last year's Listerine below the line activation. Where I guess we started off with very much the team sort of working together to solve the problems. We would have everybody on the team thinking about it and working together to solve different areas of it. There were - it was probably - there was Doug who was our CD at the time. Roger, Jess, myself, Amy. I guess working together as a group and then solving different parts of it. Working together, adding different value along the way and coming down to an idea. Which I think Jess, Jess then carried on with and it was rocky as well. To working off clients, we had a client who was quite pedantic. Bit of a workaholic. Very much sort of too and fro with the client. We eventually got the thing solved through and then brought in external, online people who made a huge contribution to it. Sort of point of sale development companies. Yeah, ended up with something that worked off the global TV ad which would run in time. And worked pretty well in engaging people on radio and then at an event at the end. I guess it was - you know we saw the original idea and she bought it straight off and too and fro really was execution of that idea. Sort of getting her buying for the look and feel of it. Getting that approved and just working those components of it. Like the online thing, working with - they've got their own partners. Working with them toward that. The brief didn't change, no. Because the idea was very much the activator of the global platform. So it was quite solid in that way and that response was quite direct. I mean, sort of controlling of - I think that our strategy and our senior clientele people involved on and ongoing basis to ensure that we're working towards our goals. The moment you come up with a solution it will be sent to check with strategy and the business directors to ensure that, before it goes across the client. And I guess the client goes through there and internal presence. I think a certain amount of stuff comes out in the creative process. You know, if your brief is a bit thin then it's working, making sure it sort of ties in using the brand insights and the brand understanding. And the target market understanding to keep bringing it back. I think that gets - there's a certain amount of sort of free creative thinking and just putting things down no matter what they are to really style out their thinking. Once you've gone through the process of that, which I think helps. I think on Listerine, she was pretty happy. I think she's prepared to take a risk provided it is - it's not way out there. If it can't be substantiative of it's own brand. If it makes sense she is going to take the risk and put the money in to run the project. I think everybody - sort of everybody's contribution really. I don't think there's any sort of central inspiration. I think it's just really the culture of working together, which I think is quite unique to our team, really. We work together very much as a whole unit, as a team rather than sort of individual pockets. I think they're very - the client can be very - some possum calls - and can - it has been frustrating that on days, actually has entirely bought an idea and been happy. Then two days later, she's not happy with it. Whether that involves her in house process or what, I'm not sure. But it can be - you can be a bit unsure about how she's going to respond to things. I think it's probably to do with her consulting other people, you know? Or perhaps she - initial thoughts don't cover, she perhaps thinks about things in a different way and comes up with different issues where it concerns, I guess. They're all going `Yes. We'll send an email.` (laughs) It's quite weird 'cause she is, you know. If she doesn't like some thing, she isn't scared to say she doesn't like it. It's not that she's innocent in the meeting thinking it's rubbish. I think it definitely is part of her process. I think good. The client service person is very much client orientated. She doesn't spend a lot of time with the team in solving the issues. That said, her client service director is more involved with the team. And the process and the team. It's a bit mixed. We've got a great relationship with planning. They're very involved. Very hands on and very responsive to our needs and our creative as well. They've always got something positive to put in and to direct our creative. Well, Doug. Doug is very hands - he was very hands on when he was here. Absolutely, you know. We need to be fully involved in any project that's going on. I think that's the culture that we work in. It's a very flat structure that the creative director is involved all the way through, and pushing and challenging Yeah, great. There's good communication. It was initially moved around quite a lot. It was worked up in different areas we worked on by different people. Different times. I think again, you know. Really good. Where I guess we started off with very much the team sort of working together to solve the problems. We would have everybody on the team thinking about it and working together to solve different areas of it. Even if an idea is not necessarily right on, I think that it's worth gathering that all in and then into that process you're resetting what is on brief and refining it there at the end of it. Perhaps responding to certain issues and problems and growing the process.   I think everybody - sort of everybody's contribution really. I don't think there's any sort of central inspiration. I think it's just really the culture of working together, which I think is quite unique to our team, really. We work together very much as a whole unit, as a team rather than sort of individual pockets I think they're very - the client can be very - some possum calls - and can - it has been frustrating that on days, actually has entirely bought an idea and been happy. Then two days later, she's not happy with it. Whether that involves her in house process or what, I'm not sure. But it can be - you can be a bit unsure about how she's going to respond to things I think there was certain production processes and the - there was a bit of a disjoint between what was done on the day of the shoot and what actually came out. I think, sort of managing the client's expectations and having her more involved in what was shot on the day would have helped. (laughs) I'm not sure. I mean, she signed off on the models and the look and feel. When it came out of re-touching on the other side, she wasn't happy and there was quite a bit of work. I think that there was - I'm not sure what. It was just a bit of a disjoint.",

    "location": "Cape Town",
    "text": "We were sent down a creative ruse that was very vague. Our client had, Shell had just relocated to Johannesburg and it lost all of it's key brand people so their team was totally disorganized. Without structure and without leadership. And without any experience in working with an agency, really. So, we were working on a brief that was really vague that excluded the most powerful brief points and we went on quite a long, bumpy ride and ended up with the Shell Diesel Revolution. You know, creatively. Photographically. Visually. Messaging wise. It was just horrible. (laughs) I think the client's total disarray. Failing the Le Mans thing aside. It was nothing of substance that came from the client that we could actually work on. There was nothing that was saying `This is what we're standing for. This is what we're representing` because they're totally ignoring what the rest of the world was doing, so yeah. I think even them as a team realized that it's rubbish. It's not something that is generally done. Everybody has their opinion, but then somebody disagrees with them can actually speak up and you can carry a project through with a sense of leadership that can see sense. It's not all that common. It's the first time I've come across it, but it is what was at Shell at the time. We were pulling concepts out of the hat and it was that one that eventually got through. I think that the decision ultimately ended up with the client. We presented a number of things and that was where we ended up. Budget wise, I think we were in budget. Time wise, we were way late. Budget wise, I think they actually cut the budget. I think at that time, really. Desperate and untrusting. I would come from a position where we had good team based trust and relationships with certain people with the client who had left. I think that was really evident - that those people had left and they were champions of agency, kind of thing. We had worked hard at building a good trust and relationship with them. The head of their brand team was an ex agency person so had insights into how to work with agencies. The other key person had, I think close on twenty years experience at Shell. Was really insightful into the brand, what it's nuances were. What it stood for. And both of them had left. Yeah. The head of brand was escorted to the door basically. The woman with really long term knowledge had left under not very happy circumstances. I think that (laughs) that inherently we always try to do something better. I think that if we've done something well that gives us a springboard to actually go on and do something better from there and if something's gone wrong, then we can build in perhaps processes or ways of dealing with those clients that will actually make work around the problems we've had before. I think that's inherent nature of what we do. I think that's aside from personal and personality clashes which obviously do the opposite. If you can't work together, that's clearly an issue. I think that different clients have different ways of working and different expectations and it's really understanding what those are. And how you work with them. If they don't have the experience of working with an agency and an agency's processes then it's a question of almost, spoon feeding them a bit more. Given creatively, they're not used to seeing a scan to represent an idea. Doing a digital scan so they can see some sort of better visual representation. Just doing little things that will help them along the line of building trust. Great. We've worked together as a team for a long time. We understand each other's strengths and weaknesses. It's good. The agency was set out to service Shell business and to a large extent the people who've - that long term exposure was working on that. On the project. I think everything. Our initial - I couldn't say our initial idea because we had quite a few good ideas that didn't fly. I think our relationship with clients. The design and work itself. The photography. The - I think everything could've been better, really. Without structure and without leadership. And without any experience in working with an agency, really. So, we were working on a brief that was really vague that excluded the most powerful brief points and we went on quite a long, bumpy ride and ended up with the Shell Diesel Revolution. Their lack of understanding of the value of Le Mans leverage, you know. I believe it is sure Le Mans is niche. How many people sit down and watch a race for 24 hours? Nobody. I think it's a fantastic brief point to stand up and say `We're going to be winning this thing three times in a row.` That is, if you drive a diesel car, it's an immediate something that you can recognize. Even if you don't, if you aren't into motor racing. I think that they were having the difficulty of understanding the context and were sitting there as consumers and thinking `I don't sit and watch motor sports so I'm not going to be interested in this brief point.` Possibly. Also, the team had been just totally - totally disintegrated basically. There was nobody taking part. They were trying to put in a new organizational structure I guess and culture. To the point that nobody was actually standing up for a piece of work that worked. It was all 'vote by committee' so anything that was presented, all it required was one person with a reason. No matter how bizarre. To actually kill whatever was presented. We had obviously [inaudible 00:39:32] internally what was put forward and strategically we were having problems because we weren't getting much, sort of strategic direction and input from client. They weren't listening to our strategic input. Yeah. It was - the brief was `We don't want Le Mans.` So to prove the V-Power diesel's power line, which is `more power for longer`. We had to ditch Le Mans basically. I think yeah. The people who had been really strong - had really strong relationships had left and we were left with people who were perhaps threatened by those strong relationships. Or were trying to then in this power vacuum trying to prove themselves. I think you build on relationships and project for project you do. You build. You grow and you get better. The longer time you work with a person or with a group of people, the better your work gets. The more insightful you are of each other's needs and of each other's targets. ( laughs) I think that there needs to be some sort of conflict resolution put in place. I think it is really dumb. I think that, you know not really from a creative point of view because we can stand back and get on with the next project and ignore it but I think from a client service point of view of when people are needing to work with those clients on a daily basis. It can be really destructive and I don't know what the solution would be there. People not answering phone calls. Being rude to each other. It's - once a person has totally lost respect for another human being, it's really difficult to move into a space where they have a positive interaction. They've set them - when people expect somebody to be a certain way then, to a large extent, those expectations are fulfilled. Not necessarily by people doing those things. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy that you expect something to be and you create your own affect I guess. Planning was good. The difficulty really was that the strategic objectives kept changing and there wasn't - not necessarily from our strategy department, they were a bit lost as well because the direction kept changing. But yeah. We worked really well with our strategy department again.   I think that as far as engaging consumers that project was a total waste of money and time. Really. It was something that should never have happened. It should never have gone through. It was a total act of desperation and I'd be happy to never see any of their work ever again. (laughs)",

    "text": "Yeah. I look through a lot of design books and websites for inspiration but like not necessarily advertising but just anything creative can sort of spark off ideas. And also to get out and sit in the garden or walk down to the gardens. I like to do that. Every year somebody gets to do the calendar and it's more of a creative sort design piece. It just sort of ... it gave me a chance to grow quite a bit because I got to sort of source lots of props and do a shoot. It was just a great learning experience and I think it turned out really well cuz everyone was very impressed and very ooh wow the calendar. It's the best it's been and things like that. So, I figure that one went well. Although, I'm pretty harsh about my own work. I always look at it and I'm like, uh. I could have totally done way better on this and that. But anyway I think if we're talking about things going well that would be. I think it went well because I had more freedom from the client. Freedom as in I could still work within the boundaries, because I always feel like when they say freedom, it's actually a shitty, scary thing because that means that they haven't given you a proper brief. You know, it's always like uh this big open brief and then you don't know what to do. But if you have a good brief and you still ... and you can kind of express yourself within that nicely that's really cool and I think that they let me do that with the calendar. I got to just decide and design and come up with things and every time we sent it over they were just, like oh wow, great. This is amazing. So that was a lot of fun. I think that the one thing that I learned at college that always comes through is that one of my lecturers said, `The better the brief, the better the creative.` And we always go like no. Like masters. (whip sound). But it really matters. If people give you, shitty sort of [inaudible 00:09:39] weird briefs it makes it impossible. Zero or minus. It's really irritating because they keep asking for it and I get really irritated because Jim keeps saying to me, `Amy, I want you to push for amazing creative work.` And then I'm like, `Jim, I do.` But every time we show to clients they pick the safe one. We always get told come up with a really cool one and then ooh should we just put in a safe one and they always pick the shitty, safe one. It's quite soul destroying. The client absolutely loved it. I didn't go to the meeting but I heard that they were pretty much on the floor. Then they were like, look we love it but we're gonna go with the safe one, because I don't think anyone else will get this, but it was like you got it. Everyone who's seen it got it. But, hey we'll go with the safe one. That one would have been a lot of fun and the safe one was very pretty at least. I got to do a lot of my nice designing. I think. Yeah, I think it was fine. I think that's probably why it was a good one, because I actually got to do some work on it. And could afford the shoot and everything. It was fine. I guess it was really good, because they gave feedback that was sort of understandable. They said, `this chart looks a bit strange.` Or something like that and I could totally say, `Yeah, you know I can see that.` But often a client will give feedback where it's like, what. Where did that come from. So, I could kind of level with them on that. It was good. Really good, they were really supportive and loved it all the way through. That's why it was a good one. Global clients seem to think that we're just a repro house. They give us our ideas and they're like, look this is it and we've got to pretty much make it up from their shitty jpegs that they send us and it's really frustrating. Cuz it's like, okay well this is hideous. Often, when we have brainstorm sessions and things they don't really understand our markets as well as we do and it's quite frustrating. We know we could do a much better job. Also, It feels like they don't trust us because often they'll send us their little jpegs of the layout and we'll ask them for the open files because we have to reproduce this piece for South Africa and they'll kind of be like, oh we've been told not to give you the open files because you know we've got to keep the quality good. And we're like yeah, but we've been told by your client to work on it. So, how about handing it over. It's always quite restraining and it just feels like we're not really important when we do global stuff. Global clients seem to think that we're just a repro house. They give us our ideas and they're like, look this is it and we've got to pretty much make it up from their shitty jpegs that they send us and it's really frustrating.

And we're like yeah, but we've been told by your client to work on it. So, how about handing it over. It's always quite restraining and it just feels like we're not really important when we do global stuff I think, concept. I think if I went with that one that I initially came up with that it would have been a lot more impactful. This was a pretty calendar that was done nicely, but the other one had humor and ... Although, I'm pretty harsh about my own work. I always look at it and I'm like, uh. I could have totally done way better on this and that. I think it went well because I had more freedom from the client. I got to just decide and design and come up with things and every time we sent it over they were just, like oh wow, great. This is amazing. So that was a lot of fun. look, we want a stupid party and just come up with a theme for it instead of just come up with something amazing. It's an experience. And then we were like, yeah we came up with the most amazing stuff and then they were like well we just wanted to have kind of like bring a DJ over or something and we were like, you could have said that. And then I'm like, `Jim, I do.` But every time we show to clients they pick the safe one. We always get told come up with a really cool one and then ooh should we just put in a safe one and they always pick the shitty, safe one. It's quite soul destroying. it had all these kind of mountain climbing things and then we came up with a really cool idea for it which was this really stupid guy I didn't go to the meeting but I heard that they were pretty much on the floor. Then they were like, look we love it but we're gonna go with the safe one, because I don't think anyone else will get this, but it was like you got it. Everyone who's seen it got it.

    "text": "We went crazy and they loved what we came up with and then we actually got to the point where we were pretty much designing the interiors for every single building in the town and saying, banks going to look like this and this and then it was on the third review and then the client said,` Whoa, I think that the experience is overpowering Smirnoff.` We were like, but it's supposed to be huge. Not what you want now. Cuz you made me turn it down and then in the meeting they were like Heineken threw a party last week for $2 million. Why can't we do something for $2 million instead of ... I think the budget was $7 or something. We were like, but um, you know don't you throw parties all the time? This is supposed to be the huge experience. This isn't just a party, because nobody's talking about the Heineken party that happened a week ago. Nobody, because this happens all the time. We were pretty much completely destroyed and heartbroken. Then the feed back we got back was, okay so we're having a party and we need to come up with a theme and an act. We were like they have events companies that can do that. We're an ad agency. I think that was the worst brief ever. Well, worst job ever. The meeting we were in had seven people in it. Which, was probably why it collapsed, because there were just hundreds of different views and they all sort of took a strange negative tone and then snowballed and then it turned out to be completely disastrous when it didn't need to be. Yeah. I can't remember her name but it was one who was supposed to be like the head honcho. Out of 10 I'd give them a four, because they really want to but then every time it's there it gets pulled back. The whole thing is a Smirnoff original like different. That's kind of the brand vibe and they keep saying, `It needs to be original. It needs to be something that's never been done before but make it crap.` They really contradict themselves all the time. But then they just seem to be a little to scared to go there. So I don't really understand what more they need to do. It seems like they're there but they're just a little too afraid to let go. I guess that's it. Yeah, like you have $7 million for the whole campaign this isn't really going to work. Budget was stupid. I think it was like ... It had the potential to be the most amazing job I've ever done. I think it was exciting because it wasn't just ads and layouts and whatever. It was more like. It was like coming up with a whole experience and I'm quite into interior design and industrial design and things so it was very exciting to come up with what the place is going to look like. I had so much fun planning it. It just seemed like we weren't getting through to them because ... It was really frustrating because we felt like we totally onto their brief but they won't see it like. It seemed like there was some weird communication barrier. I wasn't allowed to talk in the meeting and I was just so frustrated because I could have totally answered their questions and then like you said you want this and we'll put it here but then I kept getting shushed in the meeting. I don't know. Con was very ... every time they said ... Con just put his hand out like shut the fuck up. I was like, okay. He kind of spoke but he didn't get it across properly and that's what I've noticed a lot. I've often been in presentations or meetings with clients where ... we're just have misfiring communications and it snowballs from there. It becomes a complete flop where it could just be a little answer that you put across differently. The one thing we went into where ... Cuz Paul's just kind of moved up to take Doug's place for a bit and we went to a Smirnoff meeting kind of like pitching an idea and they liked it but they were just so confused that they ended up bombing half of it when it didn't need to be because they kept saying, `What about the off con stuff,` even though it was like an on con event. They kept saying, `What about the off con stuff.` We thought, shit, was that not in the brief that we were supposed to do off con stuff. Paul was like, `We can totally do off con stuff we just put stickers on instead of this. Then they were like, `Why?` And then we were like, `Because you [inaudible 00:35:46].` Yeah. It was very ahhhh. When we could have just said no. It's an on con thing like you said in the brief. Here's what we've done and Bob's your uncle. It just went horribly wrong. It was like watching a car accident. It was like waiiiiiit. Whoa. This is totally not going the right ... yeah it was terrible. That happens a lot and that happened to the biggest degree on the Smirnoff job. They were like, `But where is Smirnoff in this whole thing?` It was pretty much like we were coming up with interior design not like integrating Smirnoff at the time because obviously branding things with Smirnoff's going to be pretty easy but coming up with the exterior of a building is going to be a little more tricky. That's what they'd have to approve. They wouldn't have to approve the big Smirnoff sign on the building because that's pretty much a given and they didn't see any branding on the things. So they started freaking out like where's Smirnoff going to be in this whole town and we were like but you don't understand we're just showing you look and feel for everything so that you can approve it and it just went whoa, this town is taking over. There's no Smirnoff and we were like, ahhh. It was horrible. It was him and Lisa and then Lisa came into one of our brainstorm sessions and she was like, `Oh did you guys know that the venue has been canned?` And we were like what. What. And then she was like, `Oh, didn't Neil tell you a week ago?` It was very irritating. That was very good, smooth going. It was just like here's what we think you'll love and then he was like `Yeah, this probably isn't in line. Can that little building but I like this one and sort of worked together really well. That was a good relationship. No, it was good. They were quite supportive. They could have done more but they were pretty supportive of our ... they backed us up quite well. In the initial stages when we were coming up with the big idea they were like, yeah, we love that. Let's do that. Let's pitch it. And we went through with it and the client bought into it and obviously the client wouldn't buy into it if it wasn't backed up well. I don't know. I think they were just stunned. I think everyone was quite shocked because we were so far along and they suddenly started bringing up weird issues, like `Is this too big for our brand.` Like, what? They asked for the experience, so it was really bizarre and they could've said more in that meeting but I guess, coulda, woulda, shoulda. They were probably just very stunned and shocked and like what. When we came out of there we were quite like, what just happened? What just happened in there? It was good. Just like ... supportive They gave us good information. I think it was really good. There was a lot of supportive team spirit. There wasn't any this is my idea, this is yours. It was very us and we're going to make this happen. I would have given it a 10. I think it would have been amazing. I think the suits could have ... because I think they got kind of scared and blown away by the scale of this whole thing but it was pretty much in budget. We'd spoken to people who were like how difficult is to pull this off? And production was like, no, no, it's doable. Obviously, we'll cut back on a couple of these things but we're on the right track. I don't think the guys backed it up enough. They didn't ... I think they should have said, `Look, we've taken your budget into consideration. We've come up with all of these ideas to fit in with your budget. We've checked it out. It should be fine. And then here's the idea. They didn't and I think they kind of got scared off big time. They were like, `Holy shit you want a whole town. It's gonna look like this. Like whoa. Like this is too much. It's crazy.` But it wasn't. I think we could have shown a big more, look it works with the budget kind of thing.  think the suits could have ... because I think they got kind of scared and blown away by the scale of this whole thing but it was pretty much in budget. We'd spoken to people who were like how difficult is to pull this off? And production was like, no, no, it's doable. Obviously, we'll cut back on a couple of these things but we're on the right track. I don't think the guys backed it up enough. They didn't ... I think they should have said, `Look, we've taken your budget into consideration. We've come up with all of these ideas to fit in with your budget. We've checked it out. It should be fine. And then here's the idea. They didn't and I think they kind of got scared off big time. They were like, `Holy shit you want a whole town. It's gonna look like this. Like whoa. Like this is too much. It's crazy.` But it wasn't. I think we could have shown a big more, look it works with the budget kind of thing. Cuz you made me turn it down and then in the meeting they were like Heineken threw a party last week for $2 million. Why can't we do something for $2 million instead of ... I think the budget was $7 or something. We were like, but um, you know don't you throw parties all the time? This is supposed to be the huge experience. This isn't just a party, because nobody's talking about the Heineken party that happened a week ago. Nobody, because this happens all the time. We were pretty much completely destroyed and heartbroken. Which, was probably why it collapsed, because there were just hundreds of different views and they all sort of took a strange negative tone and then snowballed and then it turned out to be completely disastrous when it didn't need to be.  So like, she's heard about that and she thought it was really cool and she thought it was like, `Yeah, that's really original. No ones doing that sort of stuff. That's out there and we want to be sort of in that realm.` I don't think the budget was there. Especially because they were pushing for the biggest idea. It felt like in the meetings they were saying things like `Let's get a huge DJ, fly people over to the Antarctica and have a party on an iceberg.` We were like ... They kind of ... when they were coming up with the brief they should have realized if they want something huge that no one's ever going to forget. It's probably not enough. I think it was right in the beginning when they were coming up with the brief they should have realized and put more into it or brought down the brief a little bit.  think it was exciting because it wasn't just ads and layouts and whatever. It was more like. It was like coming up with a whole experience and I'm quite into interior design and industrial design and things so it was very exciting to come up with what the place is going to look like. I had so much fun planning it. It just seemed like we weren't getting through to them because ... It was really frustrating because we felt like we totally onto their brief but they won't see it like. I wasn't allowed to talk in the meeting and I was just so frustrated because I could have totally answered their questions and then like you said you want this and we'll put it here but then I kept getting shushed in the meeting. He kind of spoke but he didn't get it across properly and that's what I've noticed a lot. I've often been in presentations or meetings with clients where ... we're just have misfiring communications and it snowballs from there. It becomes a complete flop where it could just be a little answer that you put across differently. This is totally not going the right ... yeah it was terrible. That happens a lot and that happened to the biggest degree on the Smirnoff job. They were like, `But where is Smirnoff in this whole thing?` So they started freaking out like where's Smirnoff going to be in this whole town and we were like but you don't understand we're just showing you look and feel for everything so that you can approve it and it just went whoa, this town is taking over. There's no Smirnoff and we were like, ahhh. It was horrible. Our marketing guys they didn't really stick up for us. They could have saved it too. Also, Neil's got this kind of rockstar approach to their side of it where he's like the client will say to xxx in their meeting yeah the venues been canned and then he won't tell us. He'll just be like. Ahh, screw them. We'll do whatever but it's important because we've got to know this to move on and he sort of we'll find out two days before the meeting when he knew it two weeks ago and we're like, dude. We kind of need to know.   They asked for the experience, so it was really bizarre and they could've said more in that meeting but I guess, coulda, woulda, shoulda. They were probably just very stunned and shocked and like what. When we came out of there we were quite like, what just happened? What just happened in there? I don't know. I think they were just stunned. I think everyone was quite shocked because we were so far along and they suddenly started bringing up weird issues, like `Is this too big for our brand.` Like, what? They were like, `Holy shit you want a whole town. It's gonna look like this. Like whoa. Like this is too much. It's crazy.` But it wasn't. I think we could have shown a big more, look it works with the budget kind of thing.",

    "text": "Yeah. They're called Hellocomputer. They were absolutely brilliant. They did very well at The Loeries Awards this year with ... or they won like loads of stuff. A small company ... I'm not sure but they're really small and kind of new. We got them in and they just got it from the start and kind of ran with it and added stuff to it so everything on this project just clicked. Then I think the last- Most like, cherry on the coke for us really, was the feedback. I mean, we got emails from the media guys saying ` This and this banners` ... like exact feedback. `These banners run these sites from their day to that day. This is how many hits it got.` At that point, it was the busiest media placement company that was the best figures they'd ever had. It was like- I think it was the, like I said, it's the crafting of the idea. It wasn't just like ... we do find ourselves in the position where sometimes it's a bit rushed and you can't do the thing as crafted as you want to but we had time to- I mean, those banners were really- They stood out and the people were like `The game!` Especially the game one, we were all very chuffed on. We were playing it in the office and that's ... it was just so unobtrusive to people surfing websites. Normally, or a lot of time, these things can be so irritating when it's popping up and jumping up and this thing was just like a little thing in the corner, yeah, but it's such an addictive little game. Normally advertising could be a bit irritating to people but everyone in the feedback was just `Everyone loves it and everyone's playing it.` So that was great and ... yeah, and just see that it looked really well crafted and beautifully done and everyone was just chuffed, you know. We were all very happy with it and getting weekly feedback, like ... it just keeps on going. It just keeps on going well and the end, loads of entries into the competition so yeah, that was ... I can't think of bad stuff there. So what the old school is, almost in the 80s, we had those arcade games with the- with your car at the bottom. You just had to dodge the stuff and you play this game with just mousing over it and in controlling the car ... it was awesome to see that people actually having fun with it, you know. Not very big. They're very scared of doing anything new or ... I still don't know, actually. I must actually ask Rachel `How did that happen?` 'cause we so used to ... anything that's different or anything's that's really ... it's tough because- But it comes from being a global brand and the local client being very scared of stepping out of the boundaries or doing something that hasn't been done before or whatever. So I think, yeah. That's a huge stumbling block for us. On Shell, specifically ... I mean, Shell is our biggest client, downstage probably with [J&B 00:19:28]. We do find that that global thing is a big limitation to client ... trying new stuff or ... daring stuff or just- Or not even. Just something different. Anything different to what they're used to, they kind of see alarm bell or hear alarm bells going off. So I would say very small tolerance. ... I mean, [inaudible 00:20:13] just for the- With the [inaudible 00:20:15] first time in this agency really, that I work with a global clients and ... for me, I mean. I think most people's feelings just like `you just get this stuff from overseas and you kind of slightly adapt it.` So, it's kind of ... feel very limited. I mean, there are the exceptions but it is more the exception to the rule that you get to do something different or- Like, on J&B, we've got the J&B Met area, so that's another thing where they really trust us and we can just go and it's- It's awesome and a fun project to work on.  The overruling feel- The biggest feeling on global is like it's just rehashing of the same stuff. It's like, all translating, it's all adding the new website and so it's kind of ... and it's that thing of those- they're just sitting all far away and everyone's kind of scared that they're gonna bomb something or ... you know? Whereas local clients can also be difficult but in a different way. I think everyone prefers that at least you can see them face to face and you can ... it's easier, probably, to convince someone when you're sitting with them around the table. You do get difficult local clients as well but I would definitely prefer local clients- I mean obviously, you need the global guys as well but I mean, I think to work with and for is much- It's much more fun working with local clients. I think it is that personal thing. Just to the fact that you can speak on a one to one level with them. They also understand the culture, they understand where an idea comes- I mean, yeah, that's the problem with global a lot of the times. If we do something that's intrinsically South African, there is just no ... I mean it's just the way life is. They're not gonna get it. There's things in the country that you only gonna know about if you live here, or have been living here for awhile so. I mean, obviously local clients will understand. That's a big thing ... I think that's the two biggest things. They understand the culture, we're all living the same culture, and the fact that you can build that personal relationship with them ... I think is the biggest thing. ... I think ... I'm just trying to think of the clients we've got like Green Cross, the shoe company. They're local guys. Challenges for them ... but you can't really say it's because it's South African or local but I mean, they just flippin' hard-headed people. It's like these two brothers that's got this company and they just- The thing is, they don't sit around the same table even, or they don't agree on most things, so that kind of makes it difficult but I mean, that's not a South African thing, that's just a ... What we've seen with them ... we had a- At my previous at [BBDO 00:23:31], we had Checkers, which is the supermarket chain, and it was like ... It's just this giant thing and that was the whole thing of- Just too many cooks in the kitchen. It was just like, you could never get anything approved or it just- When it runs down on the food chain, you're so scared to approve anything and ... so. It was just a very ... That was a very difficult client to work for.  mean, there [inaudible 00:28:40] obviously is kind of another company that does and trusts to do- I think they're as good as they were a few years ago. I think in the middle they changed agencies or something, I'm not sure but ... just is an example of a company that's kind of doing that. So [inaudible 00:28:57] very much possible. It was, again, I don't really know why, but it just was very smooth. They loved everything, they never bombed anything, they always just said `Yes, we love this stuff. Just do it.` You know? So, yeah, it was really great. Flippin' awesome. He was just a legend. Because ... look, in the first place, we all- Our department, now as well but especially back then within- It extends from ... any company or whatever, it really comes from the boss, what the vibe is and how everyone works together. Now, Doug is just, he's a ... I mean before even- We were all just great mates. So we were great friends. We enjoyed being together and spending time together. He's a brilliant- in my mind- he's just a brilliant creative director. He's got a good eye for what will work and what won't work and he's very encouraging. The thing is, he got the best out of the people that work for him. So he was like ... when he saw a good idea, he would push it and then would do anything to make it happen. He got excited about stuff. You get some of these guys that's just like, they never get excited about anything or ... you know. So, yeah. It's difficult to pinpoint one thing. I think it starts with everyone just loving coming to work and like loving to sit close to each other every day and having fun together. Then, wanting to do good work. Doug always wanted to- He was always like `No. We can do better or we can, you know, let's push it. Well let's try this.` So he's a guy that pushed things. He's a guy that got along with everyone, that everyone wanted to do good work for him. It was also very smooth, I seem to recall. Yeah, it was a very like, team effort and everyone loved the work so everyone was kind of like, it was - In that sense, it was kind of easy because everyone thought it was good. It wasn't hard to get it through or to- Didn't have to explain it to anyone that could see what it was and ... so yeah. I would say it was very good. I'm just trying to think back. Yeah, 'cause we kind of [inaudible 00:08:05] below the line with ... we haven't done much online advertising as in banners and that kind of stuff and microsites, websites and stuff. That was kind of one of our first real projects with doing that. I don't know how- It's difficult to pinpoint why it was so successful. I think a big part was client- was ... I mean you know how it is and I think everyone probably complains about it, about how clients kind of shoot ideas down or are too scared to try stuff or whatever? For some reason, for some odd reason, when we did that they just loved everything and it was just like `Do it` and `There's money for it` and `There's just no excuses` and [inaudible 00:08:53], you know. And that was also a new experience for us was ... because we haven't done kind of stuff before, we've never had that feedback, and to get that feedback was really brilliant 'cause just to know that what we're doing is actually working and ... people are responding to it and stuff. That was really cool ... Yeah ... and that kinda sucks, if I ... I wasn't too involved with it. That was about ... Yeah, 'cause I've got these two- I've got Diesel Extra and V-Powered Diesel? This year they wanted to go on this whole thing about Diesel Revolution. It's not more- Not any longer the old days of ... You just get the crap diesel. Which now I've got this other offering but our crap diesel is actually also quite cool. So it just isn't now `Whoa! Diesel Revolution. We're changing the face of diesel` kind of thing, this year. But we ... I don't think it ... yeah we went- That was a game. It was kind of just the client's view. What difference the client can make from being totally supportive and totally alarmed as to do what we do, to going `Oh, this is what we want. We want guys with flags ... and like, doing this and they're walking up a hill and it's the Diesel Revolution.` Then we end up just doing that 'cause it's like, they won't budge on it. We'll fight in the beginning and after a while, it's just like ... it's just not worth it so we'll just do it. So ... Yeah! Yeah yeah yeah! No no no no, it like goes down to the detail! They must be wearing this and there's like three black guys, then a white guy, then five more black guys you know. It just becomes silly so ... you know ... yeah.   What else about it? I think ... also, we had- We sometimes get very busy and you don't always have the time to sit and work things- the details out and stuff and that thing ... everything is work together. We had enough time to sit and brainstorm those banners. We had a good- That's also the partner that we got into, actually design the stuff. To design those internet banners and to design the microsites- Yeah. They're called Hellocomputer. They were absolutely brilliant. They did very well at The Loeries Awards this year with ... or they won like loads of stuff. A small company ... I'm not sure but they're really small and kind of new. We got them in and they just got it from the start and kind of ran with it and added stuff to it so everything on this project just clicked. Then I think the last- Most like, cherry on the coke for us really, was the feedback.

    "text": "And we'd written this spot ... which we felt was really good and then, client had a problem with it and they wanted it changed- the ending? I'm just- First thing I can think of now. It's not a major thing. I mean, but it's just maybe an example of how things can, in my eyes anyway, go a bit wrong for no reason. It went backwards and forwards quite a bit, like the spot was in a- We kind of had PeeWee [inaudible 00:40:30] at the beginning but near at the end, `Are we summing it up or whatever? We're not like totally convinced and stuff`. The arguments that they had, what they wanted to do, it was almost like explaining- Like, we kind of wanted to lead it in the listeners mind like `fill in the blank` kind of thing whereas they just wanted to spell it out, you know, spell out what we're trying to say. That just became so dumbed down for us and it was like- And we fought about it for awhile and backwards and forwards and try to do it a different way but not their way. It went back and forth, back and forth. From then, we just said it's actually not worth it. Let's just finish it up because we have to record like, tomorrow or whatever and it just- Yeah. So, I think that's a very frustrating thing that sometimes happens for me, especially because I love radio so much and like hear about it and stuff. You want it to be right 'cause the thing- You're gonna hear it yourself on the radio and then when you hear it and it's not right, then it flippin' irritates you and it's like ... so. That was a big thing and that came from- And that I can't explain to you why that happens. I seriously, I mean- among ourselves, we've got like this `This client is just flippin' stupid` and like `They're never gonna get it` and I don't know how to explain it to them that they get it. It's kind of a way we feel, that they should trust us because we're supposed to specializing in this and like, it's communication. It's like, we're not there to spell everything out to people. We're there to involve them and to reward them for listening to our radio ads so ... it's like `Ah, I get it` you know? That's kind of what you're looking for. You just get clients- and this happens a lot, it's not just this client- where they don't get that. They just don't [inaudible 00:42:17] but no, you must tell them. Tell them what we've got to offer them and whatever. You gotta be more subtle than that. You gotta be like, kind of, trust that they've got a few brain cells and they can work it out for themselves, you know, 'cause then they feel like `Oh!` They feel involved in this thing and like, you know, for us it's kinda like basics. That's like 101 that they teach you. Don't complete the circle for the public, or for the listener or the viewer or whatever. Just leave something so that he finishes the thing. So, it's that kinda thing that kind of happens and ... I can't explain why. It's like you'll get a client who's just like dead set and they're just like `No. We want to say this and we will say this and then that's it.` That's the best example that I can think of right now You gotta be more subtle than that. You gotta be like, kind of, trust that they've got a few brain cells and they can work it out for themselves, you know, 'cause then they feel like `Oh!` They feel involved in this thing and like, you know, for us it's kinda like basics. That's like 101 that they teach you. Don't complete the circle for the public, or for the listener or the viewer or whatever. Just leave something so that he finishes the thing. So, it's that kinda thing that kind of happens and ... I can't explain why. It's like you'll get a client who's just like dead set and they're just like `No. We want to say this and we will say this and then that's it.` That's the best example that I can think of right now. And it ruins it, yeah. Especially when we get the opportunity to do nice radio and creative radio and they don't get it. That's kind of frustrating. We don't really handle- I mean, we kind of argue in words with client service. 'cause they have the liaison. They will go and speak to- We never actually speak to the client. Well, rarely actually speak to them about it. Client service would come back to us and say `Your client says they don't get this, they won't say this and this` and we'll have a little, like `No, but you gotta explain to them that this is what we're doing. This is what we're saying. This is why we're saying it like this.` That's where diplomacy comes in, where you've seriously- and I've got a lot of resect for them, that they have to do that ... the client service, go back and- be the middle man between this whole thing 'cause it's not easy. You gotta kind of, then, go back to them- to the client- and kind of ... it's all about diplomacy I think really. You don't wanna- it's such a fine line between dissing them, like making them feel stupid or whatever, and convincing them that what we're trying to do is the best thing for them. It's kind of in their interest to do this way and not that way. So ... like I said, we don't personally- We, to the best of our ability, try to explain the reasons, like `Step 1, 2, 3` or whatever, to client service and `Okay, look. This is what you're saying their problem is. This is why we've done it this way. This is why we think their way is gonna detract from this way` and ... Maybe their option seed is like `Okay. We can take what they've said and kind of try and implement it or we can change it slightly or whatever` but kind of, I think- The feeling at the end that we try to get back to the client is that we're really working hard to make it the best for this job for you. It's not because we're trying to be funny or whatever. This is what you're paying us to do. You're paying us to sell this product or do this thing. Let us do our job basically. So, yeah, but that is, I think ... It's probably the most frustrating thing for all of us and ... but it's part of life, you know. ... that would be ... I know who it was but it would've been one person 'cause it was ... a very hard-headed person. They got, yeah- but it's also they got involved in the details. I mean, they were happy with a thing- like the script and whatever. Then they got involved in like the little details- At the ... giving it back to them, yeah. As for the brief, they weren't still happy until they got the script. Then they saw like one little detail and they were like ... freaking. Then it was a bit of back and forth and created options. I think, like, various different options of what we can do now after hearing what the problem was. We tried to- We went back with, I think, three or four different options to the same script and just changing- No no no. We pushed for- We gave the options back like kind of, fiddling with it and [inaudible 00:49:34]. We still backed our original one the whole way through but then we would say `Okay, if not that then maybe this` or whatever. It kind of went back and forth and we said `No, maybe try this, maybe-` it kind of went like that for awhile. They kept changing their minds as well, you know, like `Eh ...` or they would send one back and say `No, no. We've thought about it again. Like, maybe we should say this at the end` or whatever. So through that process, we kept fighting for what we believed in until, like I said, at the end it just became a time issue where it's like `Well, we gotta go and record this thing now.` Actually, we were sitting downstairs in client service, when client service- The person when Rachel came back again and said like `[Brian 00:50:18] does not sit ... this again` and I just said `Okay, that's it.` I'm all for fighting for stuff or whatever but it was just like, whatever you can't try and explain something so many times. Oh yeah, yeah. Just like- Flip, you know, 'cause- it's also, the thing is that we were going- especially since Doug let- we just, we've gone into this time where it's ridiculously busy. So we constantly juggling ten jobs or whatever and this thing keeps coming back and keeps coming back and whatever. It was just like `We don't need this right now. We've tried! We really tried but it's gotta go.` I think client service kept it quite- I mean, we were kind of ... but that's why we never speak to them- Rarely and from my ... I was getting angry or just like, you know, just please get this thing done so we can get on with it. I think client service kind of just shields them from all of that. They never see that or they never ... so I think that the relationship was pretty good. I mean, they just saw this like ... conversation or whatever. I don't know. The radio one. With accounts, it was fine. It was like ... you know, we discussed the problem. I mean, she was the liaison personnel [inaudible 00:53:25] and ... she always saw our point, which is good. She understood what we meant and kind of went back to client and try to explain it to them as best as possible. So, yeah. I think that relationship was- I mean that's quite enough normally how it goes, you know. Whenever there's ... you know, we kind of communicate internally and she was always there, she always understood and she always went back and tried something. That's all you can ask so ...   Strategy was good. [Russell 00:54:00] ... Yeah. Relationship very good, Russell's brilliant. He gave us all the right stuff that we needed and whatever and ... Yeah. No, strategy's always- since I've been here- we've had two strategy guys and they're both really brilliant.",

And quite a big team that are quite experienced and have had a lot of experience because then, their ideas obviously become our ideas. And I gained a lot from that, personally. Yeah. We're still waiting to find out what the outcome of it was, but yeah. To me, it was very complete. It was broad. It was [inaudible 00:06:33] it. It was in the case of we just did it. It was ... we pulled a lot of ideas, a lot of thoughts, a lot of actual physical doing the work. And then we came at it from a very objective angle. And just to make sure the whole time that we were on track, that we were on brief. That we had the right thing. And it was very exciting to see how it had evolved from a small idea to actually quite a well thought out, massive thing. [inaudible 00:07:08] in terms of strategy, creativity. Yeah, and what we had to offer the client. Yeah, what other ... I think in the time that I've been here, each job has actually been quite successful in itself. But it's probably because I'm still a new broom sweep clean. Cause everything's great. Yeah.   Absolutely. And that, I think for me, as well as being able to pitch the work that you do. Have somebody able to actually sell it at the same time and be confident and energized and vibrant and excited about the stuff that we do. Which is cool.",

    "text": "What was so great about it is the fact we came, we addressed it from a South African agency, so we kind of incorporated the Joburg agency quite well into it. The Jo burg Creative Director came down, and then he was actually presenting the work to the client, because Con was away. Because of that happening we pulled all the Joburg creatives as well as the Cape Town branch ones. And then halfway into our tangent we stopped and we presented to the MD, Jim. And we presented Cape Town's ideas. Then Dave, the Joburg Creative Director, presented what the Joburg guys had done. It was really interesting to see the Jobug's ideas in comparison to ours. There was a lot of overlaps, we had come up with similar ideas. But then it was kind of picking out what was working in one, and what wasn't working in the other, and then just kind of merging the two as best as possible. Which I found quite interesting, and it was also nice to get an outsider's, or look from an outsider point of view at the same job. If you know what I'm saying. And how they approached it. And then looking- [crosstalk 00:01:39] Cause then it was interesting for us cause then we could then obviously see what was working for us, and then also see what wasn't. Similarities were, for example we had come up with the idea to have this club. A card club, that was consistent in both of them. And obviously the card offered those things. What else did we have that was kind of similar? Basically a lot of the elements, the mechanics of the campaign were very similar. Kind of coming with two different concepts, one was very much based on respect. The other one, our one, was based on stepping into a different environment. So that was cool. I'm not too sure, actually. Perhaps, it could be just the creatives themselves, who ever briefed them, how they perceived the brief. How they understood it. It's supposed to be quite elite, but subtly so. Or accomplished, let's say. And we approached it from more like you're accomplished but you don't mind letting your hair down at the same time. Whereas they didn't maybe take that step further and go like we're letting our hair down although we are accomplished. It just kind of stayed at accomplished. I don't know if it's perhaps becomes the time that one is given, where creative thought processes stop or have to stop. That maybe refers back to what I was saying about things not really starting, it just is a cycle and you stop where you're told to stop so to speak. We then picked it apart, addressed what was working, what wasn't working, and then pulled it all together. For once, before the picture actually got like too many ideas we learned that having too many good ideas is as bad as not having anything at all. So kind of picked it apart and then embraced the areas that we thought Joburg was doing well at or better that us at. And then took our own theme and created our own which we finally pitched. And I think that was pretty solid in the end. Yeah, that was quite successful actually. It's cool to have the interaction between the opposites. I find being part of something gives back, gets people, I don't know, I get a lot out of being a team. I think knowing you've got more people on your team striving for the same ideals, and the same motives can be quite successful. You feel like you've got more of an impact perhaps. Because of that happening we pulled all the Joburg creatives as well as the Cape Town branch ones. So kind of picked it apart and then embraced the areas that we thought Joburg was doing well at or better that us at. And then took our own theme and created our own which we finally pitched.

    "text": "I'm trying to think of ... nothing here at present, that I can comment on. But yeah like in the past, projects that don't go well I think are based on the money element, where people just give up good ideas to compensate for the fact that they're getting paid. Not having a, I think it's really important to have a, one figure, as like a token of strength you know. And so that you've got, if you've got an issue, or you need somebody to fight for what you actually do, you got one person to do it, that's willing to do it, and that's got enough confidence in you, confidence in themselves, to carry it forward. You know what I'm saying. Cause, as far as campaigns go, if your client ... So yeah, which was, the whole thing carried itself on the visual. It had to look like it was intense. And then the client said but we've got this picture of a guy throwing Coke over his head with a little cup. And we're like, it's not the same thing. And they're like, why? It is. And to have a creative director not stand up for the fact, that truly that is the guy clunking Coke on himself. And that was gonna say that this is the most intense race you've ever done? So I had to throw Coke in my face to make it worse. So yeah, I think it's key to have a backbone. My boss should have recycled her campaign. They actually did do a cheapy shoot to rectify the situation but it was no where off, like the mark where we were actually heading. Really embarrassing. Yeah, so. Yeah. I don't know, these [inaudible 00:21:52] rectify creative directors that don't have, like a backbone. You could have a creative director pouring Coke on his head, going “get a new job”. Massive gripe would be politics, internal politics in offices. It's like ... don't even come to work, it's pointless. It very much becomes like ... sure, we're doing the same thing every year. But none of them, if you had to put them up, they don't even look like it's under the same brand, if you know what I'm saying. If the logo wasn't there, you wouldn't be able to say that that is definitely Cycle Tour, pick and pay Cycle Tour. The consistency was in the treatment of the ad, which I don't think is where you're waiting should lie. You're waiting shouldn't lie in the treatment of the ad, it should be in the bigger idea. And I think it was very much compensating big ideas, for it to look like it sort of did last year. Pieces of the bike, the bike chain would make a mountain, or you know, those kinds of things. It never became like, a personal thing. I suppose the elements, their challenges, there are, as well would be the fact that limited for cash, limited for shooting. I think, as an agency we shouldn't see ourselves as people that come to work and sit behind computers. We should be seen as creative people, you should be interactive with creative people. So, get photographers in, let's look at people's portfolios, let's see how's good at doing this, and who's not so good at that. Get people who are sculptures, you know, don't be static in the ideas and development. Always kind of, focus. Like I always think to myself, the best way to start the day creatively would be just to stop and pick out the Communication Arts Annual and just check it out. Just gear your brain into new ways of thinking, or tackling something, and then carry on with your day. Don't just carry on with your day like you did yesterday, because it's just moves us into the same motion, the same way of thinking, the same ... yeah. He went to get his own idea. Because it had been running for so many years, and worked with them for so many years, let's just say that the relationship was good. I've seen them the clients to our agency on a social interactive level, and you know, generally seemed like good rapport. So yeah, I can't exactly say or not that ... We're so tired of each other. It was so funny because a new girl started, and she'd come to me and she'd ask me, “ Don't you just want to come around here and have a look at this type thing I've done at the bottom?` I'd go, `cool, no worries.` [inaudible 00:36:10] Oh yeah, that's really cool. Don't listen to me, because in therapy, what I say, Andre says the exact opposite of. So, she would go `oh, hahaha.` [inaudible 00:36:26] rest of the day. By the end of the day I saw a printer, I went, ` did you get rid of the box?` Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah, very much so. I think what is also very interesting is ... peoples perceptions of something. I think once you've created a perception ... how group dynamics also affect, that perception of you as a person. And, how politics as well can affect you. You, haven't changed how you do things, or too much of a degree. Just the simple way that the cards fall ... ends up being more important than the actual job getting done. So, you've just gotta go, “okay, I'm going to go do the job somewhere else.” I don't think that the work that's been generated was necessarily ... you know plaque top like, you know if I'm looking at to scale yeah, probably so ... maybe four. Very much on the four. And I think that the clients were happy with the relationships, but did have a tendency to go, oh but give us a little bit more. And yeah, I think very much sitting in like the safe zone, from all sides. So, it's touch and go. I think more team efforts. I definitely think that the team was lacking, the sense of we're in this together or we have the same goal, focused on it, I think ... You know a lot of things happened ... you know with the chiefs, and there was a lot of chiefs and the guys doing the work weren't really aware of it. I think if you're not really aware of your purpose you're not going to do it very like, with dedication, with motivation, it almost becomes like the puppet, whereas you're not really part of the play, you know. Coke over his head with a little cup. And we're like, it's not the same thing. And they're like, why? It is. And to have a creative director not stand up for the fact, that truly that is the guy clunking Coke on himself. My boss should have recycled her campaign. Yeah. Okay, I think another problem there is, that job has been done by the same agency for ... at least ... five years, I think that was probably the fifth year we've done the campaign and under the same creative director and the campaign's almost, tend to look the same. You've got logo, you've got when the date is, you've got sponsor logos, and you've got this space where the big idea goes, you know. And it becomes very static. And I think it was very much compensating big ideas, for it to look like it sort of did last year. Pieces of the bike, the bike chain would make a mountain, or you know, those kinds of things. It never became like, a personal thing. Only to come back a week later, so we started, we told him all our ideas and then he went “Oh yeah these are my ideas`, because it's his company. Yours are crap, mine are great. We're so tired of each other. It was so funny because a new girl started, and she'd come to me and she'd ask me, “ Don't you just want to come around here and have a look at this type thing I've done at the bottom?` I'd go, `cool, no worries.` [inaudible 00:36:10] Oh yeah, that's really cool. Don't listen to me, because in therapy, what I say, Andre says the exact opposite of. So, she would go `oh, hahaha.` [inaudible 00:36:26] rest of the day. B It just go to that stage where he'd say X and I'd say Y. I don't know if it's just old school thinking and new school thinking coming in. He's the person in the situation that doesn't want to take the risks.You know what I'm saying? I'm happy to take the risk, probably because I've got not much to lose. Whereas he's not willing to take the risk because, he's got everything to lose. That kind of conflicts ... and stops you from going forward, I think, at the end of the day.   For example, I design logos. I think the best ones, he would completely shoot down. They wouldn't even get to the client to ... end up presenting. Old school stuff that wasn't cool, as a result. Yeah ... I think, as far as -  think more team efforts. I definitely think that the team was lacking, the sense of we're in this together or we have the same goal, focused on it, I think ... You know a lot of things happened ... you know with the chiefs, and there was a lot of chiefs and the guys doing the work weren't really aware of it. I think if you're not really aware of your purpose you're not going to do it very like, with dedication, with motivation, it almost becomes like the puppet, whereas you're not really part of the play, you know.",

    "text": "What happens off that, they presented and then the next day it was really, seldom happened. As a creative person you got like a little, you need to be nurtured, and looked after, so if you put in a lot of work, you know we work the whole weekend, it's great when somebody comes back to you immediately and says, you know, this is how it went. I mean, that's really important. And the next day we've called everybody in the whole agency and sat down in the board room, and they basically pitched to us what they had presented. So, that was really nice because for me, although you've got the creatives working on it, and the ideas, and we're making movies, and doing all the creative bits and pieces, you've also got the strategy guys working their asses off on case studies, strategy, that kind of thing. So, for me to see that portion of it was quite exciting, and beneficial, and appreciated, so yeah it was just, we all come out of the meeting, what they pitched, remembering case studies of things that we've done before, and just reassuring everybody here of what we are, and what we are trying to achieve, and I think unless you've been here a long time, you're gonna walk away from that going you know this is really dull. I think the majority of the people came away like, yeah, you know, excited about who we are as an agency and what we do. No I wasn't. But basically yeah, apparently very positive. They already good relationships with the brand managers at Smirnoff and JWT, cause we're doing both the [inaudible 00:04:30] at the moment as well. So, it's basically pitching for the below the line stuff. So, yeah ORD basically lost the below the line account, so we are at the moment, are doing a bit of the work as it stands, as we are the above the line agency. But then still have to pitch for the below one. I think we're one of five agencies that pitched. Hardy Boys been one of them. I think they were just so happy and impressed with what actually, with how it went down and the work that we put into it, that it was kind of like, we need to show everybody. I think that - I would say that they have, because we do above the line stuff, and have done a lot of work for them and have that relationship, they are pretty open minded and pretty secure in us as an agency and what we have to offer. Yeah, they kind of employee us to do our job, where, and times before in the past we've experienced, that we're employed to do what they want us to do. Why spend the money employing us when you're not going to use our ideas, you're going to still make us do your ideas, which is kinda of defeatus isn't it? It was interesting in the sense that kind of, because there was so much, so much stuff and so many ideas, it was a case of like constantly challenging it, going is this the right thing, is it the right, you know making sure it is on brief and on key. And I think because there were so many people involved and attacking it from different angles, that was key. Because sometimes you have a small bunch of people who have to do a lot of work, and then you just end of charging them in the one direction because no one's actually reigning you back to actually go have you look at it subjectively. So I think that was very key to the outcome, in the sense that the creative people would get cracking on it. And then you get, so then the strategy would come and check, we'd present to the strategy guys and then they would start asking us questions and make sure that we had thought of our. So yeah, and then from there as a strategy and creative team it was then presented to the MD. And then looked at it objectively again and then presented. You know what I'm saying, so it was constantly revealed and then challenged on a day to day basis, which was you know - Apparently it was good. Apparently because, all because we've done so much work with them in the past, that the relationship's already there and pretty cemented which is definitely beneficial. I think ... I think there's a competitive thing that also happens as you say, we've got the above the line guys, and the below the line guys, I think the competitive nature between the two of us, like that's almost you know, dissolves itself or it could be geared up or used to be benefit. Because we'll do something on our side, then they'll do the exact same thing, but their way. so yeah it was just, we all come out of the meeting, what they pitched, remembering case studies of things that we've done before, and just reassuring everybody here of what we are, and what we are trying to achieve,  where, and times before in the past we've experienced, that we're employed to do what they want us to do. Why spend the money employing us when you're not going to use our ideas, you're going to still make us do your ideas, which is kinda of defeatus isn't it? No one was impartial to it, and said `oh no we don't want that`. It was a case of we don't really know what it is, or no one has really given us a valid reason to drink it. So it was almost kind of based on validating it, you know, what is it and why you should drink it. And why. So basically, that's the brief was.   It was interesting in the sense that kind of, because there was so much, so much stuff and so many ideas, it was a case of like constantly challenging it, going is this the right thing, is it the right, you know making sure it is on brief and on key. And I think because there were so many people involved and attacking it from different angles, that was key.",

    "text": "We had to adapt a part of the stuff and come up with new executions. So, and it's quite difficult, those kind of projects with the brand off stuff, because it's got very tight restrictions. I mean, everything didn't run smoothly. But what I did like about the project is getting everyone involved in the same room. Like, I don't like having to work with the retouchers separately, and the photographers separately, and ... I actually like it if everyone is on the same page the whole time. And I won't brief anyone separately. It works very well, 'cause you get your expert and I get my photographer, my retoucher talking from the very beginning. And you know, I also like ... what we did in the project is we came up with the staff and then before I had to say `No, we're shooting at like, and this and this and this,` I first speak to the photographer, 'cause he's a guru in that area, so why would I go and with my limited experience, say ... so I spoke to him, gave him the whole, like the scans and stuff, and said `What needs to be ... how are we gonna solve this? What is the best way to solve it?` Because it's quite difficult having a five meter mirror ball in a real life scene without creating a ... putting shadows, reflections, how are we gonna do it ... So in the end, and the global stuff, there was a lot of stuff that I think was done quite badly. I mean, it was cool, but there was some stuff that was quite ... we wanted to break away from it a little bit 'cause there was a lot of like, that. In one of them, the hand was lost in the ball. It wasn't even there. It was badly done. But I mean, people don't notice. Oft, what they just see is cool, you know. Anyways, so ... yeah that was really nice, because he got his retoucher and they worked it out exactly. And I like having that much control over the product beforehand, like, knowing there'll be no surprises. Like, we know the wardrobe is definitely this, the colors are working together, from the beginning I know my mixers this ... they were all in the meetings. I mean, that's a normal, people aren't actually meeting, but just before that, all the problem solving, that was quite cool. 'Cause, I mean the one ball was six by a hundred, so I mean to actually shoot a thing that's--'cause it was a continuous train, the bauble was like a train with people pushing mirror balls. And the whole thing wasn't mutually conceptual. It wasn't creatively conceptual, this idea. It was more the working that felt, the whole process was quite smooth. And it was all because of the communication that there wasn't any gaps. And it was ... you know, it was cool that he wasn't, you know, he wouldn't phone me and say `I need ...` it wasn't like a `what now? Kind of thing. It was constantly working together on it completely. Like, and his expertise and putting mine together and getting the retoucher together and having discussions and then getting the sliders together before we even do anything. So that was very cool. And also just from one house. I think it's the one house kind of thing, 'cause they organize their casting from the ... so there was just no room for someone not knowing or falling off the gap or anything like that. And then, yeah, it just came out very well. I'd say like, just the process for me was like an absolute joy. It was just lovely. Just knowing like ... there were some problems one the client side. The whole thing almost fell apart on the day of the shoot because there was miscommunication on the ... they didn't approve a thing, they thought it would be fine, and then on the day they said no, they wanted more ... they had comment about the one tower, and it's, or something like that, there wasn't a tower, and there was a whole thing. So in that way, often the approval process takes quite long, especially with global stuff. And they get quite scared. Guys here get quite scared of, it's almost like they don't trust us here. So we get a lot of hindrances that way, because they think ... you know, if global does something, then they trust it, if we do it here, then they think it can't be or ... you know, and our budgets are often very small, that's very frustrating.  you know, and our budgets are often very small, that's very frustrating. But often now, the projects as well. There was another one also we worked on, was J&J, Sleepy Boys Dreamed Of. Also again, it's nice when you have a big idea and it fleshes out quite well, you know, it has all, it answers all the boxes. It's not a lot of miscommunication. But see, in the end there was some miscommunication, because it's not all from the same stable. Like we have a, there was a Below the Line company that did their stuff, so [inaudible 00:20:46], it's all the, I have to go through client service to get ... it's sometimes incredibly frustrating, 'cause you actually just want to speak to the other guy and say `Oh, all the files, it's all here,` but then there's so much gaps and ... in the end, the projects get so long, or you get the thing so late, and you've got like three days instead of where you could have had two weeks. Oh, yes, it was very ... my creative director went over, drove over to them, and convinced them by showing pictures [inaudible 00:24:06], showing the setting, because it was all about the setting. Showing them the setting and saying, `Does this look ... what does this remind you of?` And because a lot of the people, they said, `Oh, Joburg without the tower in it.` And we said, `The tower will be there, but like, because it's the same angle, but buildings is blocking it, so we just had to move the one thing so you can see it.` But people were like `Oh send it, send it.` So most of the people in Brandhaus, they went like, `Oh ...` and then they, because the research, out of their little small group, 'cause there was one guy going `No no no.` Which, anyway, there's people who said no, didn't have a say, they were actually global, it's not really their say. Our client was fine with it originally. But she's obviously, they're scared of the [inaudible 00:24:57], the global guys, even though it's not ... they were more into codes on legal stuff, on like `is the dress too short,` or `is this too that,` you know, that's what they say it's about, but they're not, they say isn't really about the location. But they said it and she was a bit nervous. Yeah. And I think because they've lost a lot of money, that also helped us, by saying, `okay, well this is the cancellation fee.` You canceled late. If they wanted to cancel then they should have done it earlier. And we, often with clients we have that problem. Like, very last minute they want to change something, and then ... but you can't just do it at the last minute. 'Cause like, there's ... in a way, clients need to be educated in that way. I feel very strongly about that, because we can't say yes for everything if ... they should know. You can't just do that. You say, now there's lots of things that have to follow. That's very much ... but they can, I mean, I do think, if I compare some of our clients to others, when a client is more educated in advertising in knowing how the process works, it's incredibly important. If they don't know, then they really expect, and it's very up to the client service people to get that across, to explain to them the process, and how long it takes, and yeah. You have to set your boundaries in advertising so hectically. On this project, or ...? Oh, this wasn't a new project. No, they were quite nervous, I think. But at least they went through with it in the end. We try to make it local. So I remember us all sitting, having cocktails, thinking of stuff together, because we got stuck with a [inaudible 00:33:56] by 101. And we obviously want to use the sights to its maximum to do something different still, even if it is a global thing, to do it even better, and even more different. Still try and be creative with it. It's a little bit difficult, because ... it's difficult to stay creative if you know it's a thing that ... you won't get recognition for it because it's been another one, so adapting it then, and still trying to do the craft well, I think depends then on your, you know, if you're doing it for the client or if you're doing it for your own like ... than win an award. Because it won't win an award, because it, not so many, because it's their idea, and our execution. But yeah. On this one? It was actually ... well I didn't have a personal relationship with her, but client service girl, yeah, quite a cool relationship actually. She's very, see, she was actually very cool. It was the top guy that she spoke to, 'cause she got a little bit nervous, 'cause our thing was quite risky. Because it was all the de-editor codes on this project. We had a whole meeting. We almost thought, we warned them and said, `As long as you know ...` 'Cause with the local thing, the whole thing of rolling a mirror ball down the street, if you had to compare that with a normal de-editor code, they'd never allow that, because it's like, on the street, and you can do, you're saying this, and you're saying `irresponsible this,` and ... there's lots of things you can say, 'cause I mean, we couldn't even, there's so many things we can't do here because of those laws. And they have the same stuff but it seemed to past this. So because we're going from that we're like, `Oh, okay, well we'll roll the balls down this train station. It'll be fine. On a rooftop.` I mean, usually you wouldn't be able to do stuff like that, on a rooftop with a ball, because I had a TV ad. So ... but she was very nervous because they then, afterwards, the big guys then said stuff like, `Ooh, they don't know about that, you can't do it on Mandela Bridge, because it's Mandela's name,` and we're like [crosstalk 00:35:53] Okay, it was successful in the way that we worked together on it. That's a, yeah, seven and a half probably. The train. The train was quite different. That was quite more, of the project, 'cause we had three that we did, the train was quite something different, and it was quite, using ... the train station was using a billboard in quite a new, innovative way. I haven't seen a hundred meter by six, a five meter by a hundred meters story happening. Like, nothing is repeated, it's all different. That was a ... so in the global way, that was probably different then. Yeah, more time definitely. If we had, if it wasn't so rushed, that would have been better. The rest, you know, it's just the time, 'cause I would've wanted to craft this train station more. Yeah, the time is where the problems came in, because that was, it was the crafting that I missed with, I wanted to clean up things more, and then also with the, you know, because of little time, it led, the whole problem with the location came in, because they didn't have time to look more, and ... just more time. The rest of it was actually quite smooth. Smooth going.  It was constantly working together on it completely. And then, yeah, it just came out very well. I'd say like, just the process for me was like an absolute joy. It was just lovely. Just knowing like ... there were some problems one the client side. The whole thing almost fell apart on the day of the shoot because there was miscommunication on the ... they didn't approve a thing So in that way, often the approval process takes quite long, especially with global stuff. And they get quite scared. Guys here get quite scared of, it's almost like they don't trust us here. in the end, the projects get so long, or you get the thing so late, and you've got like three days instead of where you could have had two weeks.   Yeah. And I think because they've lost a lot of money, that also helped us, by saying, `okay, well this is the cancellation fee.` You canceled late. If they wanted to cancel then they should have done it earlier. And we, often with clients we have that problem. Like, very last minute they want to change something, and then ... but you can't just do it at the last minute.  I think depends then on your, you know, if you're doing it for the client or if you're doing it for your own like ... than win an award. Because it won't win an award, because it, not so many, because it's their idea, and our execution. But yeah. If we had, if it wasn't so rushed, that would have been better.",

    "text": "Even with us doing these fillable stuff, it was such a rush, such an incredible rush, and then everyone was just working through the night, and then it sits on people's offices before it goes out for a long time. And that's often the problem with creative process. They ... everybody, even the crafting, like it's important, a good idea can be fantastic. If it's not well crafted, it can fall flat. You can't do it the other way around, but I really really believe a good idea can become a good idea through crafting, except its idea is crafting. But the other way around, you can have a fantastic concept, and if it hasn't got a good budget, or you haven't got the backing of the organizing, of the ... which leads me to a bad project. It looked quite successful, I think. Overall it was successful. It was successful. But our process was, like, I think the workers, like, I was incredibly overworked for that time, because everything was very badly managed in the way of communication. You know, things would, we had like, an idea, and it was presented, then it came back, it just stayed in the system for a long time. Like they bombed it. And then in the end there was only very little time left. That's often when the process goes, 'cause then you haven't got the time that you needed for it. If you had the same kind of idea at an event company doing it, they'd have years to, or six months, or whatever, doing a big project that has a lot of logistics and ... you can't just do something quickly, and then ... You know, and that project often felt so much miscommunication, 'cause also Smirnoff thing, it was Division 7, and was this promotion with MTV Base and Smirnoff Storm. And yeah, I just ended up being, like, taking so long, I mean, for, actually for stuff to go ahead, and I actually started working on stuff before we got the go 'cause I knew that, like, there's no was I was actually doing this thing in the timing if I don't start. I still worked on staff, I'd already had the deadline without having any briefs on my desk. And then, I mean, there wasn't briefs, it was so badly, it was so badly done. And it was just miscommunication and things not, it was too much work, too little people. That was actually the problem, I'd say. We're being understaffed. And you can't just get something out. It's not about, you know, if we had to brief someone outside to quickly do a design thing, we'd give them proper time. You know, you'd give them ... but in house, if you do something in house, you can't just, you can't expect it to happen here and do the same quality. To have the same crafting time. Often. We had the same thing happen with ... there was another project the other day ... it was very frustrating ... had everything already down the line. Ooh, it was actually, that was a bad project. Actually that was worse than Division 7. Ooh, it was bad. It was another billboard. I did quite a lot of billboards in a row. It was another billboard, so between the Division 7 thing. And at the time we were quite understaffed. So our traffic lady was doing like, traffic buying as well as ... our buying and traffic. And that's nuts. You can't do all of that. And with that project, it was very embarrassing because our time was incredibly tight. This one was also too tight, the timing. It was too tight. And what happened was she was ... after we had, because we had to go along with the process, and the client said we have this much. So we got a nice photographer from London to come out. She used to live here, but then she came through. But then, in the end I had to cut the thing by less than half, something like that, which was insanely ... it's a very very bad way, we couldn't cater, we couldn't warm the pool, we couldn't ... it was actually quite embarrassing. It was terrible. That's actually happened quite a few times. Cutting budgets suddenly. It's really not cool. It's them. It's suddenly realize they have less money. That's hap-...

    "text": "That's cute when they do that. Oh, I miss my niece. Anyway, how it started off, it was incredibly rushed. We had to, it was, again, it wasn't a super-creative thing, it was like, we had to come up with `quickly, something that is clearly fresh!` And it was really rushed, and didn't, it was very much an odd direction thing, we didn't ... you know, the line was really cracked, so it was just odd direction. And we had a big budget on it, something like ... I don't know, something like, 1.5 million or something for billboards, like a lot of money. And we, yeah, so the idea we came up with was very much, it was very much a crafting idea. You needed the best of ... it was very much a David LaChappelle style. So we sold the idea, and the style, our client loved it, and we explained to them this and this. We got the photographer, and said, `This is the photographer's work, this is perfect, she can do this.` But because we had a big budget, and a budget I could [inaudible 00:41:14], we were like, `Cool, we can actually fly her in.` 'Cause she's not here anymore. And the other guys that do fashion in Cape Town, that kind of fashion, the one guy's doesn't work so ... I see sort of like [inaudible 00:41:23], and the other guy, not so good at expressions. And this woman was British. She's perfect for the job. And we've worked with her before and she's, she was just perfect. So, but she didn't want to work in South Africa anymore really because of the fact that budgets, these kind of things always happen here. So we said, `No no no, we've got a big budget, everything's cool.` But now at this stage, [inaudible 00:41:45] was insane. We had to shoot already very soon. So we explained her idea, and she was super excited about it, she wanted to work with Conn again, and we didn't have final sign-off, but our timings were so tight that we had to start getting the ball rolling. So then, we spoke to Herbert, like, `this is what we're thinking...` and then she started putting in input, which she probably shouldn't have done, put input already. She started putting in input. Now ... and she was right for the job and everything. She was getting incredibly excited. She was seeing her staff and editor. Then, just before she was gonna ... we had to do this very quickly. She had to fly down, everything had to happen very quickly. So ... and she got a team together of people that she was thinking she'd work with. So we got some of ... in fact, nice people, 'cause with this kind of thing, this kind of execution is very much on the, based on the execution. It has to be done like, really diesel/David LaChapelle. Very styled, very, you can't just get a normal stylist, you need like ... so then she started giving input, and then just before she had to fly, like ... oh, it was such a mess ... the budget got cut in half. Now she's from London. She's already had input. What we should have done probably in the project is, we should have then counted our losses and said to her `We can't use you anymore, our budget's cut.` Yeah, that's what we should have done. But the thing is, it was very uncomfortable because the ideas she gave and the ideas we bounced together, was what we would then use, and you know, it would feel very bad using it and going ahead with it if she gave some input, you know? So that was very terrible. Yeah, so then she ... we told her this is the scenario, it's been cut, you know, `What can you ...` and she was like, `Well, okay,` she still wants to do it, but it's, she can only do it for so much. So then our traffic lady at this time wasn't really such a good art buyer. She wasn't really ... art buying wasn't really a thing. It was more traffic. So she estimated the cost for us for the models and everything. And she estimated, I mean, we did a green cross shoot a while ago, and she estimated according to the cost for the models for that. No, we didn't, I didn't do cost, so it wasn't our fault. I didn't know, like, she had costed for that. So the cost got approved and everything. She put down like, very little for models, we needed about 20 model, or 10 to 20 models, and they needed to be the best. They needed to be ... that they were able to paint it on the type of models. They needed to look international. They needed to have long legs. They needed to be perfect bodies, 'cause it's in a swimming pool with a blow up, big spin bottle. And, ooh, just [inaudible 00:45:14]. r So then, also, but our models also got cut into, they have to be 25 and, they must look 25 and older. Now we can't get them, most of them were overseas at the time. But except for that, we can't afford nice models. And like, Jillian's coming down, we tried to do casting, none of the models are right. We haven't got money, the ones that are right are too expensive, we can't afford them. Then our stylist went ahead and got all the stuff and everything, and then there was some miscommunication with the money. JWT took long with the payments, they had to pay out of their own pocket for staff, which is very embarrassing again. Then they started phoning me because the art buyer doesn't, she doesn't know what to say to them, because the payments aren't going through. She can't say. So they start phoning me and asking me for the money, and I'm like ... it was terrible. And then the art buyer got me to ... she's like, `I mean, you definitely should just drop some catering stuff by.` I'm like `What?` She's like `Just drop it on by.` In the end, there was like, no proper catering done, like, it was, like, people from the agency was taking catering there, like, all these models were freezing 'cause the pool, I had spoken to the guy about the pool, I shouldn't be talking to people about pools. It's not my job. And they couldn't heat, they said the pool would be heated. The pool wasn't heated because I didn't use, didn't have enough money to use the proper heating thing. The models were miserable because it's cold water at a cold time. The photographer's pissed off, the stylist hasn't got her money, oh, it was a big, it was such, it was such an embarrassment. And they kept on phoning me, I had to fight with the agency afterwards and say, because then there was this big thing with the retouching, there wasn't enough money to do the retouching further. Quick, quick, quick, but in the end, that thing lay on someone's desk for how long? We could've actually ... the girl didn't have to work after hours, send the thing on whatever through. They would fight with me for saying `I'm here on a Sunday, the girl hasn't sent her stuff through.` There's no one to tell me, you know, I can't ... I have to make a call and say `Yes, you'll have to just send, you'll have to do it now. Because we can't off the deadline so that you're subject to it and pay you overtime or whatever.` It was, oh, it was very badly managed. And it was quite a, I almost flipped out, because it was so bad because like, next time, after that, when people say to me, `Will you please phone this person?` I'll be like, `No, I'm not going to, because it's not my job.` 'Cause it starts, oh, it was a big, big, big, it was so embarrassing because she's such a cool photographer to work with. I don't think she'll ever work with JWT again. And even the models, they were absolutely miserable. I mean, it was really bad. And after this whole thing was approved, they almost bombed it. Off it was shot. The legal guy ... everything was approved and everything. They came back and said `This is how you do the old codes.` They came back and said that the blow-up bottle ... there's one woman. The blow-up bottle was very big. It was like, three meters or five meters, so it's big. And all these people in the pool, it's clearly fresh, and [inaudible 00:48:14], it was very much executional. Slightly over the top, you know, the glistening, that very [inaudible 00:48:19]. And the one girl held it up like that. Thing's big. And it floats up at all the people around, and then they came back and said, `No, it looks like she's giving it a blowjob.` I mean, it's a big bottle. I think it's, well it's not the main client. It's like the legal, it's also part of Brandhaus, but I think they do the legal stuff, you know, is the top too low, all the [inaudible 00:49:50] code stuff. I think it's to do with, they have to submit to them, you know, they're like, everything must be right according to them. So they're not really for the ... I think so. I mean, I'm not sure exactly, all about that. I just, you needed to just hear the comment. Of the ... no. Because ... but another project that also went very bad was another thing, was also with art buying because we didn't have a proper art buyer. And it was, I worked with Michael Marshfeld, which was the one that, the J&B guy that was so cool to work with, photographer. And another project I worked with him was also terrible because budget was cut and then, I ended up looking for clothes, and I ended up looking for, because we had already made this promise. And it's very, that kind of thing is really, it's not cool. It's a lot of cuts. But next time I will learn by saying, `I'm not going to,` or ... Yeah. I mean, with Jillian, she knew the budget had been cut and all that stuff, but in the end it was an issue with us, because she was ... she actually wrote a mail and everything. She was so upset because she wasn't paid like a month afterward or like, very soon afterwards, she still didn't receive her money from JWT. Because there's so much legal, not legal, so much paperwork that has to be done, that, I mean this has happened before with JWT. I think it's quite, it's very bad actually because a few times now we've had people that'll, that don't want to work with us because, well I know about this one illustrator that does scamping for us, and he's just like, `No, you guys take too long to pay. You don't pay.` And I think they shouldn't have to phone, and she had the same thing. Like, it was, oh, and she's world-known. It was so embarrassing to ... we worked very well together. She understood that I was like, so hurtful, and I didn't know what to say to her, and I just kept on saying `I'm so sorry.` It's very bad when you're in the middle like that. But like, I got along with her very well. She was very cool and it was lovely shooting with her. Lovely shooting with him as well. But if you're, yeah, the organizing is very important. And not over-promising. t's very bad when you're in the middle like that. But like, I got along with her very well. She was very cool and it was lovely shooting with her. Lovely shooting with him as well. But if you're, yeah, the organizing is very important. And not over-promising. No, probably not, no, I don't think we ever promised, it was difficult to do the same thing on the budget. And that way we did because the budget was so cut that, that kind of thing, we had to do it again. Because timing is so tight, and billboard's already booked. It's like, you can't really end, you know, you should know. Even if it's in that way, the client must know, never do that. And client service, who was client service again? Was it the same girl? I think it was. It was the same girl. Shame. She was so overworked. Yeah. It was about four, five. And traffic girl, same traffic, same thing. Oh, that's it. And you know, you can see the difference between good, like, that's why I was so relieved with the starter party thing, because I was so relieved at just proper organizing. I was like `Oh, this is lovely.` And you know, and models, casting, wonderful! `Yes, let's go for those!` None of this nonsense of no one knowing what's going ... I won't let my head like that again. I will demand on ... Shame, they were lovely people. Very lovely. I can't blame them completely. It was very much the budget being cut and all this stuff, but ... Yeah. I did a lot of their work. Like, I ended up speaking to people about digital members that she must have found out and I ended up phoning, doing catering. I mean really. It was a lot of ... Anything I would have wanted to do different with that other project actually, is if I could have flown up and ... it's always, with casting, it's difficult to see a casting if you're not the agency, the people in person. And because I was in Cape Town, they're in Joburg, and we didn't have a lot of time, and the budget was halved, I couldn't be there and see the people in person, and that's very important. You have to see them in person, 'cause they change on their photo. Oh, everything. Everything. From a ... We shouldn't have gone with Jillian [inaudible 01:09:37], but she's thought of me. We should have cut it off and said `I'm sorry. I know you've put in, we'll probably use your ideas, but ...` Because that was, we all spoke together. None of us should have done that. None of us. But the thing is, if we hadn't done that, that's why this is such a catch-22, we would never finish timing in what has to be done in the time. We had to get the ball rolling. With the end client, we should have strictly, we should have stuck with what they gave us, I should have earned with that Division 7 thing. I should have proved a point by not working until I get my brief, 'cause that's how it works. I should have done that. With this thing, I should have ... all of us, we shouldn't have done anything until they had the file going, which if we had done what they had done it, we would never have finished. But then, that should be like that then. They should know that that's how it works. Then they would learn, you know? Then we still would make it happen. I think stick to the protocol. I think that's what I learned out of all these things. Don't bend backwards for them because, just ... it's important to bend backwards, but, you know, tough love, almost. That's how they have to learn. But that Division 7 thing, it would have been a disaster if I didn't work beforehand on the stuff. We had to, it was, again, it wasn't a super-creative thing, it was like, we had to come up with `quickly, something that is clearly fresh!` And it was really rushed, and didn't, it was very much an odd direction thing, so then she started giving input, and then just before she had to fly, like ... oh, it was such a mess ... the budget got cut in half. We can't use you anymore, our budget's cut.` Yeah, that's what we should have done. But the thing is, it was very uncomfortable because the ideas she gave and the ideas we bounced together, was what we would then use, and you know, it would feel very bad using it and going ahead with it if she gave some input, you know? We haven't got money,   `I'm here on a Sunday, the girl hasn't sent her stuff through.` There's no one to tell me, you know, I can't ... I have to make a call and say `Yes, you'll have to just send, you'll have to do it now. Because we can't off the deadline so that you're subject to it and pay you overtime or whatever.`  I worked with him was also terrible because budget was cut and then Yeah. I mean, with Jillian, she knew the budget had been cut and all that stuff, but in the end it was an issue with us, because she was .",

    "text": "Yes. In Cape Town. They're also global. It wasn't one project. It was a long project but was a great piece of work to be involved in. It came from a really good strategic place. What they wanted to say was quite clear. All we had to do was think of interesting ways and different ways to just sort of actually ... the radio was probably the best part because there was a TV campaign which was [inaudible 00:08:04] was quite well established. But radio's always a tricky one for them to crack. They'd never done radio. The campaign worked well on TV but they couldn't translate like this was another agency before they came to us. They could never try to put that into radio. Just didn't know how to do it for radio. Some of the humor's funny to look at but to hear it's quite tricky as well. Jokes on radio sometimes aren't that funny. They think they're funny but they aren't. Well, the co director who was Francois and us two but we kind of ... the kind of people we understood quite well. We both had kind of quite dry humors. So we slotted in quite easily. So a lot of the stuff we'd do anyway because we knew they were funny and they were good and they were alright. But yeah it was just the two of us. I mean occasionally you'd get some help from Curtis would throw a line or two and you could make that into that. There was a little bit from the side but generally it was [inaudible 00:13:38]. I think the trick with that job was converting the humor from TV onto radio. That was the trickiest part. That was the part that had me [inaudible 00:17:04]. The other part was the best part. [inaudible 00:17:06]. On that one was very good, exceptional. They bought almost everything we did. There'd be occasional ones where they'd say that's too risky. We can fight it. Whatever. Whatever. We'll do once or twice for you guys but ... Well, just some of the humor was just a little too close to religious issues. We did a couple of those. So yeah, but they ... they were generally ... they were great. They really were great. They never ... they kind of let us do our own thing. I mean we knew obviously when you present which one's going to be a problem, if it's going to have religious or sexual issues or whatever you know or to upset. You know when you're passing the bar. But they were very amicable. They were very keen to work with us. They understood what we were doing as well. Obviously to make a joke, you have to piss somebody off. You can't be nice all the time. Some of them I don't think anybody, there probably were complaints on one or two but there was probably the risk the brand was willing to take because they were to be out there ... they had to be noticed. And you can't do anything with wallpaper. They were fine. We were fine. They were fine. I mean we had a better understanding of the brand than he did. His background, his cultural background was quite different to ours and his sense of humor was quite different to ours. We kind of left some to show where he didn't always get it. Well, I mean obviously there are when the spot is too risky and you can't do that. Try [inaudible 00:19:51] and we'll take that as a backer and that kind of a thing so, yeah. I think his background was very different to ours, even though he was a [inaudible 00:20:00] person, we came from different ... he was Afrikaans. And he was quite [inaudible 00:20:06] and young. So we kind of got it a little quicker than he did. I don't think they were [inaudible 00:20:30] but I don't remember any stumbling blocks in that brand, especially with client service. I think everybody ... oh yeah. I think it had to do with that it was such a fun bit of work to be on. Everybody kind of shared in it. You know? Just [inaudible 00:20:54]. Just didn't know how to do it for radio. Some of the humor's funny to look at but to hear it's quite tricky as well. Jokes on radio sometimes aren't that funny. They think they're funny but they aren't. But he'd get it wrong. It was quite funny. They were a little bit rude as well but [crosstalk 00:10:36] the rude ones. And they'd be sexual because they're quite funnier. People like that. Yeah, that was a huge campaign. I think they did 35 radio spots hat he used to ... a little [badge 00:10:46] front. A little bare jingle and it's, `Welcome to another session of [crosstalk 00:10:52] Barman Larry.` [inaudible 00:10:58] yeah that was great for us. It became huge for the brand. They still do them. And that was quite a coup for us because they were like doing ... conveying their humor from TV to radio was ... hadn't been cracked yet. Nobody had done it. Even when it was with Hunter Scott, they hadn't done [inaudible 00:11:33] a respected agency would manage to do that. So it was a really cool first. It never won any awards unfortunately which is always a bone of contention but it's still good for the brand. You know it's good for me. They still use it. Well, the co director who was Francois and us two but we kind of ... the kind of people we understood quite well. I suppose his superior who and it was one of those brands as well where there was a fair amount of success already. So if you tamper with something that was quite established would be very silly. So it just let itself go quite easily. We would ... I think we just bulldozed it a lot of the time because is was [inaudible 00:19:30]. Yeah I think and also it got to the point where kind of he trusted we knew what we were doing. I think his background was very different to ours, even though he was a [inaudible 00:20:00] person, we came from different ... he was Afrikaans. And he was quite [inaudible 00:20:06] and young.   I don't think they were [inaudible 00:20:30] but I don't remember any stumbling blocks in that brand, especially with client service. I think everybody ... oh yeah. I think it had to do with that it was such a fun bit of work to be on. Everybody kind of shared in it. You know?",

    "text": "The brief was sent out. It came to us. What the fuck was the [pov 00:22:21] line? Connect. Get connected. Connect. Something like that. It was about connecting with Bern, connecting with people, connecting to other and J&B's got an integral role in connecting people. We were meant to do a TV ad for ... one TV ad and we went back and forth probably presented about 14 scripts. We'd gotten 20 but when you use 14 of those scripts and we went back and forth back and forth and client didn't know what they wanted to say ... and, yeah, strategically all over as well. They didn't really know what they were doing and the personality of the brand. The brand had gone through quite a rough patch. Probably five or six years of quite a bad patch and they were all over the show. There was no single line of thought. Just them saying different things. So that was all over. They didn't know their brand either. And we ended up with one ad that was great that we did present. We even went to brief directors. So it was quite close. We were on track. I think they researched. They put into research with some other global work done by an agency in Germany and their work was quite ... what would the right word be? It was just easy work. It was flat. It wouldn't ... it's nice. It's fine. It wouldn't do anything crazy and they eventually went with that after about a years worth of work on one TV script. So that was quite ... that pissed us off quite a bit. You know it works [inaudible 00:24:31] which is very boring. It's just fine. You know we would have done something really different, especially for the whiskey ... in the whiskey category. Would have been one of those ads that would have stood up and noticed. It ended up being something that was quite user friendly for all countries as well. A person in India, it'd be fine. I person in South America, it'd be fine and we understand. You know? Yeah all the working, successful brands piss somebody off. You know? They definitely stick out. They do something interesting and I think those clients, which are still are clients [inaudible 00:26:55]. I think a lot of it had to do with they didn't understand ... the brand manager didn't understand their own brand and what they want to say and want to look like, what they want it to feel like so it was ... I don't think they really put that together agency enough and ... but they didn't leave it up to the agency. Quite a lot of people calling the shots as well. A lot of clients have probably three, four. So within their ranks there, there was a lot of indecision. So within them they didn't know what they were really about. I mean I know a lot of ... obviously on a lot of, especially alcohol brands, there's a lot of rules and regulations and it is [inaudible 00:28:32]. You've gotta be sensitive. But within that there are a lot of brands out there that do take the risk and do reap the rewards. During the process? I think it ... no. It didn't. No. Didn't really. No. I kind of think it was the ads changed quite dramatically during the process. No. It didn't. We probably got ... we weren't very inspired at all by that point. It was kind of a point where we were just trying any angle, anything. Doesn't matter, you know? It just kind of got to ... we didn't know really what we were saying. We kind of knew what we were saying but we didn't know how to say it anymore. We'd gone through so many options. Kind of like the road we hadn't taken. What does that do? Just ... we weren't inspired but when it did spark something off, it did become quite exciting. It did take a while to get there. I think once we got there it was just kind of it was a great reward. [inaudible 00:31:05] there was cool. Yeah. I think it was kind of exhaustful [inaudible 00:31:11] or so we thought. To what they were telling us. It was fine. It was quite frustrating. It was frustrating. I don't think they knew either what the solution was. Strategy on that one. I think it was pretty much the same ... I don't think ... I don't think we got enough direction from them. I don't think the brief was quite right. The brand had gone through quite a rough patch. Probably five or six years of quite a bad patch and they were all over the show. There was no single line of thought. Just them saying different things. what would the right word be? It was just easy work. It was flat. It wouldn't ... it's nice. It's fine. It wouldn't do anything crazy and they eventually went with that after about a years worth of work on one TV script. So that was quite ... that pissed us off quite a bit. You know it works [inaudible 00:24:31] which is very boring. It's just fine. in the whiskey category. Would have been one of those ads that would have stood up and noticed. It ended up being something that was quite user friendly for all countries as well. A person in India, it'd be fine. I person in South America, it'd be fine and we understand. You know? Yeah. It just never went away. It just kept coming back. They'd go and research. We'd make some changes to a board. Put more black people, [inaudible 00:25:34], whatever you know. Do this. Just make subtle tweaks and go back sort of reverse and go back and no we need some more options. And we'd make some more. Why? I think client often wants to be everything to everyone. It happens too much. And you look at successful brands doing do that. No successful brand does that. I think it was a problem that's blown up. [inaudible 00:26:14] clients want to be nice to everybody. And you can't. Well you certainly can't have ... you won't be noticed if you want to do that. And I think that they did that on that job. Just want to play safe all the time. They do something interesting and I think those clients, which are still are clients [inaudible 00:26:55]. I think a lot of it had to do with they didn't understand ... the brand manager didn't understand their own brand and what they want to say and want to look like, what they want it to feel like so it was ... I don't think they really put that together agency enough and ... but they didn't leave it up to the agency. Quite a lot of people calling the shots as well. A lot of clients have probably three, four. You'd get like the head marketing director who'd agree with the ad and then the brand manager is disagreeing with it. We probably got ... we weren't very inspired at all by that point. It was kind of a point where we were just trying any angle, anything. Doesn't matter, you know? It just kind of got to ... we didn't know really what we were saying. We kind of knew what we were saying but we didn't know how to say it anymore. I think they kind of took us down a route or kind of approved a route, made little changes along the way on one route and then eventually said, `No, no, no. We can't do that. Do something else.` So I was part really frustrating because they didn't know what they would do. They wanted to say. And it was a lot of back and forth. They started sweating the small stuff and we didn't ... they didn't give us any real direction. You know, they didn't say that is right. They just kind of ... also got people sort of got lost along the way.   Kind of [inaudible 00:32:47] but presenting. I think we kind of ... I think we probably let it go for too long. Probably let it go for too long. We should have stopped a lot sooner. And said, this is a direction but if we're gonna start changing one scene all the time. Then now everybody has to wear you t-shirts because it's J&B color in TV ad. They'd start putting in things like that which in the big scheme of things is really irrelevant. That's sort of the kind of things they were coming back with and you know I think we kind of let that stuff ... let it get too far without looking at the big picture. You know what I mean? And we got of course kind of sucked into ... ou know? So I think there was a lot of frustrated ... I mean we were all in it together. We were all, you know, feeling a little bit worn out and, yeah. Obviously tense there just ... fucking [inaudible 00:34:32] please, come back with something. And they'd come back ... almost there. Can we just do this? Yeah, we'll do. I don't think they were a hard enough client as well. You know? So I think there was a lot of frustrated ... I mean we were all in it together. We were all, you know, feeling a little bit worn out and, yeah. Obviously tense there just ... fucking [inaudible 00:34:32] please, come back with something. And they'd come back ... almost there. Can we just do this? Yeah, we'll do. I don't think they were a hard enough client as well. Well because Kahn was here as well. Kahn jumped up an down, kicked and screamed. He was out front. He was there. So we couldn't take his word for it. It happened just say keep going. We're almost there you know? We'll get an ad out soon. I don't think they were forceful enough as clients because [inaudible 00:35:44] there which is ... fine. It's a fine add but it's not gonna have a local feel to it. It's not gonna belong to us [inaudible 00:35:56] do an ad for South Africans. So I think we were let down with them as well. They could have been a bit stronger.",

    "text": "Sorry, for Halls? I don't know, because that guy he suddenly he was not afraid at all, maybe the idea was not too risky. It is not risky, I would not call it quite well ... It was just simple and bright, and nobody was afraid of that. Well we have very good relations with the creative director, with Ivan [inaudible 00:20:14]. Not only with that project, but with any project we have together. It's not close relationships, but good, official relationships. Yes, it's very important and I started feeling that importance when I came here. I used to work in a small local agency with only about 40 people staff. The relationships were quite close, we were as family there. It was a bit difficult to tune yourself to global agency, where people are not so close. Where people only work together, they don't spend time after work. We used to spend some time with the previous agency, with the people from the previous agency, we were really close. We really understood each other from [Russian 00:21:48], as we say in Russian. When you come to a global agency where people just send tasks and describe what you should do. It's a little bit difficult from the beginning, but then it's okay. With me, with the client, with anything. The processes are not really professionally built, even now. Though they start being changed and being improved, and I appreciate that. Maybe it was just an exception and the client was quite relaxed, and understanding. They trusted Ivan, all our clients trusted him, he's [inaudible 00:24:54] winner, and anything ... He's quite an experienced person, and everybody knows that. So actually so many things are about this person. Planning was okay, the client ... You know, the whole project was okay from the very beginning. But I don't think that it's due to this or that department, this or that person. I don't know why the project goes so well. Maybe it was just an exception and the client was quite relaxed, and understanding. They trusted Ivan, all our clients trusted him, he's [inaudible 00:24:54] winner, and anything ... He's quite an experienced person, and everybody knows that. So actually so many things are about this person. In two words, in two words. I would rather say that I don't like the way the planning department work and the account department works in our agency I think that advertising as an industry is quite a young industry in Russia. So many people come here being not very good professionals. You may see so many young girls in account department. They don't know how to work, they don't know how to speak with people, they are not good psychologists. They're good at nothing, but it's not their fault actually. It's just the objective reality of the industry that we don't have people. There's a big lack of professionals in the industry, and that's why we hire somebody, and we start learning them. Making them learn things, like teaching them of course. So many people grow un-taught. They don't become better. Yes, you see a young girl working as an account manager with you in the agency, another young girl working on the client side. They communicate with each other. So they're like postmen, they don't do anything, they just deliver tasks and documents. But still, they may have some ambitions, like what do I have? Is it a nice text? I don't like it. Why should you like it? I don't write it for you. But she may still be an obstacle there. So that's what I call bad processes. You know, when talking about the planners, my personal experience is quite different. In the previous agency I had a very good planner, very good strategic planner. Actually he's the best within the industry I know. All the people that we have here are far away from him. They are not good. The process, yeah, I think that the processes within an agency, actually with a Russian affiliate, the processes are not yet tuned well. Actually until some moment in the past they were completely untuned. It was a mess. Now they are much better actually, because we have other persons, just another understanding of the problem and things start being more or less attuned, constructed, and it's much better than a year ago, I think. But the project I mentioned was a year ago, and it was maybe partially it was because the client is okay with us, and the persons that worked at that time there were adequate. We just had only one presentation of the ideas. We just came up with them and they selected the ideas just from the very first presentation. It's an exceptional thing, well at least with me, with my career. They say, that's okay, we like it. We actually shot one of the ideas was shot afterwards. Actually there was one decision-maker, one general decision-maker. At that presentation we had only three persons from the client side, and it was evident that only one of them makes the final decision, and he made the decision right during the presentation. He said, `Okay, I like this idea, and this idea too. Let's make the shortlist.` The process, yeah, I think that the processes within an agency, actually with a Russian affiliate, the processes are not yet tuned well. Actually until some moment in the past they were completely untuned. It was a mess. It's difficult to say, because every time we meet with every client, with every task, there may be quite different number of decision-makers. Even the quantity of managers is different from time to time. Now we only have one manager, then somebody else may come up, then again, and the ... The more people you have at the meeting, even within some internal meetings, the more difficult it is to satisfy them. I think they're not tolerant, they're afraid of risks. I can understand it, because the managers they depend on the money that they will get in the end of the year. Or they are afraid of ... It's their maybe task to be afraid of something, I don't know, but sometimes they seem to be too scary. Quite a definite thing. You know, I like Jim Carey as an actor, and as a comedian, I like his movies. One of the films actually give me a hint, it was Truman Show. There is an episode in the film where he sits on the bank, or actually on the shore, and he starts crying and the rain starts falling right on him as a pillar, whoosh. He had rain only around him. Yes, it's very important and I started feeling that importance when I came here. I used to work in a small local agency with only about 40 people staff. The relationships were quite close, we were as family there. It was a bit difficult to tune yourself to global agency, where people are not so close. Where people only work together, they don't spend time after work. We used to spend some time with the previous agency, with the people from the previous agency, we were really close I would call them ... I can't find the nice word to describe them. I would rather not describe them. I don't like the relationships with almost any account manager in this agency. But that is probably my problem, not the problem of the agency. I don't know. I know how it could be better for me, if somebody doesn't like the way I work, for example. I know how to scare me, for example. If I know that I may lose the job, and I'm very afraid of that. I'm not a Muscovite, I came here from the regions. Which is quite important for Russia, because I cannot find work of the kind in my home city. It is almost only within Moscow that you can find nice job of a copywriter, well-paid. So if I know that I may lose it, I'm going to tear my ass apart. I don't know if it works with other people, with me it does work. They're good at nothing, but it's not their fault actually. It's just the objective reality of the industry that we don't have people. There's a big lack of professionals in the industry, and that's why we hire somebody, and we start learning them. Making them learn things, like teaching them of course. So many people grow un-taught. They don't become better. PROJECT ID   They are not convincing, they are not smart enough. They don't have sometimes appropriate education. So I see that they are not good, they're not relevant.",

I'm still in for some other indefinite work. So they don't what they want me to do, I don't know what they want me to do again, or as well. Sometimes it all comes from the global way to some details, to the way that we come to presentations, and we find that there's some misunderstanding because the managers did not understand each other. Or the managers from their side may have sent something to our managers, which they didn't accept, or didn't find relevant to ... Didn't find necessary to tell us. You know, this project, and this client just takes away the powers from me, and it takes so much time. I still don't know if there will be any advertising campaign next year. Maybe it's just a waste of time, and we ... Maybe you know, we live in Russia in some kind of isolation. We still think that every agency of the world is Alliance winner, and all the people around the world are so creative and bright, and only we are dumb and our clients are dumb, and scary. Now we know that the situation is a bit different. Within the agency? Oh, again, every time there's a new number of people. We have at least two people from managers department, from account department. We have a person from the strategic department. Something like that. that No, to the market it's quite okay with the market, but they are not quite okay with the way we think. You know, considering yourself a creative person makes you think that you may think for somebody else, or you may create something really interesting, outstanding. Something bright, original, all sort of things. When I come to presentation I know that they will not understand those originality, brightness, blah, blah, blah, all those aspects that makes my idea nice. Just one simple, [inaudible 00:40:36] and that's it. So I can understand that, so it doesn't offend anybody, older audience, for example. The time is okay, because we started to work in the beginning of the year. Now half a year have passed, and we are still, for nothing, we still with nothing we have to go with, so we are pressed for time right now. I'm at a loss every time we present. So okay, they look at me, `Okay, uh-huh.` They're nodding their heads, `Uh-huh, mm-hmm (affirmative). That's okay, uh-huh. Just omit that nice thing at the end, and we'll approve that.` But that's the gist. I cannot just remove it, because ... `But you know with this thing, it sounds a little bit dangerous, it may ... No, just rewrite it without that.` So I find myself starting writing things just automatically, just for quantity. Maybe this will come through, maybe this one. Actually we made a TV scene, we shot it in January. Even the script they were being not quite bright, but still had some joke. Even that joke, was eliminated and reduced to nothing, and I cannot put the TV scene to my portfolio. Though the client is happy. That's okay, we have a nice results. Again, the situation and the difference of JWT Moscow, or from other JWT offices, I don't know, or from other agencies, is that so many relationships go through one person, through one definite man, Ivan Chimburov, Chief Creative Officer. He acts as a copywriter, as a creative person. He acts as an account manager, though he doesn't make any calls, or he doesn't type documents. But still he communicates with executives on the client side, maybe that's the ... It's different because actually there was a quite nice planning department work in the beginning. But you know, when the client doesn't know what they want to have, just do so many parts of work, we're just thrown to a trash basked and ... Every time we start working, we just try to guess. So every trial is a guess. Perhaps they will like this, perhaps they will like that. Perhaps they need this. They don't know what they need. We may try to guess. Well we have feedbacks every week. Well not every week, maybe every two weeks. But it's the feedback for what you've done last month. ... absolutely the opposite to the first one, because the girl there who sends the letter, she just really collects them and makes a list, without thinking what the comments are about. I'm still in for some other indefinite work. So they don't what they want me to do, I don't know what they want me to do again, or as well. Sometimes it all comes from the global way to some details, to the way that we come to presentations, and we find that there's some misunderstanding because the managers did not understand each other. and only we are dumb and our clients are dumb, and scary.

Why the hell didn't you do that? We told you about it, I told you. He told something to me different, why should it ... Okay. No, they are very, I would say that they're very afraid of doing something, though the product is for young people, for younger audience, they themselves are not that tolerant to risks as young people. I would say that they're not understanding to what? To ...

    "text": "Mm-hmm (affirmative). Two weeks from first briefing to you on air. We need ... We had to create a TV commercial. It was TV commercial for children and their parents about special offer. For parents, they had IT in this offer that any parent could know everything about calls his child done. This project was created near September so we done TV commercial about ... in typical school manner. We used very touching music. Music which are known for any people in Russian. We have several small histories in this script. Histories about the children who ... I'll try maybe to make some pictures. They, don't know, but MTS has the brand shape like e. And we created the children shoot collected into the shape. For example, small boy playing with leaves with beautiful red or yellow leaves. And he put it up and they are shaped into a brand shape. Or maybe there was a story about one class who stands for photoshooting and they stand in their brand shape. So it was a rather simple, plain but it was very touching because we offered very beautiful music and it was very hard to conduct casting because it was summer. And in the summer, there are no children in Moscow at all. Actually, it was about three or four. It's actually too hard within this because it's a Russian company and they have a lot of levels and they have a lot of managers. And their manager almost often doesn't know which project is on the other levels. Actually, I think it's a problem in Russia because a lot of clients tell us about ... they would like to see something new, something fresh, but then we created it, they afraid of fresh ideas because they say, `We need fresh ideas. We should only show our product and show the price maybe.` And people would buy it. In Russian actually ... has beautiful phrase. I don't know how to say it in English. In Russian, it sounds, `People [inaudible 00:21:08].` Which means-  And now it's a real situation in advertising area and between our clients so it's too little clients who can decide or to do something fresh because they really afraid of ... and of course, we communicate with low level management. And they're afraid of decisions about any actually fresh or new because they also should ... they are responsible for sales. And it's more suitable for them. We had creative director, but formal creative director who took part only in one, maybe two meetings. There was a previous creative director, Vadim. I mean not Ivan because Ivan is still creative, but lower level. So he was nice actually because he was very busy and the most ... his functions wasn't mine. Account. Oh, it was beautiful relationship because there was a very nice girl, very responsible and very caught to the project. I mean very interested in the project. Actually, in this project, it was absolutely my own project because I have no art director on this project. It was absolutely... I have done it almost alone because no other director, almost no creative director. It was too hard but I'm glad that I had the job. That's all. Yes, yes, yes. And I know that the group which now is working with this client, they have a lot of problems because they produced manager, I mean, top level manager who before the day of on air the project, he could say, `I don't like. Create something new.` So it was a problem. Actually, I think it's a problem in Russia because a lot of clients tell us about ... they would like to see something new, something fresh, but then we created it, they afraid of fresh ideas because they say,   Everything. And now it's a real situation in advertising area and between our clients so it's too little clients who can decide or to do something fresh because they really afraid of ... and of course, we communicate with low level management. And they're afraid of decisions about any actually fresh or new because they also should ... they are responsible for sales. And it's more suitable for them.",

Sometimes, we have [foreign language 00:30:46] several mistakes maybe in any project, something else, but it's not critical and not same about bad project. Maybe, I have the one project in previous agency which was bad. I hope, I think, bad. (silence) It was a project for mayonnaise. No, local brand mayonnaise. It was a client who doesn't know what they want. It was nice. They invited us in their restaurant, in their factory, in their office. We communicated a lot, but there was communication about something else but not the product. I don't know. I changed the agency, then I know several people from that agency change the area of their interest of responsibilities. They left advertising and got a job. Yeah, but I survived. I think, yes, it may be important and of course it will be helpful for both sides. For example, I'm as a copywriter, I work with our director as a couple and if I had bad art director, I have to find new one or my boss should do it and if I had good art director and we had ... It's not a question of relationships. For me, it's a question of experience and knowledges because I could have good relationships between me and art director for example, but I realized that he have knowledges for doing the work. For example, sometimes we need to make a picture. Sometimes, we need to communicate with directors, I mean shooting directors. Sometimes, we need to understand different stages of shooting process. I understand these things but I would like to see the person in my couple who will understand too. But relationships, it's ... I think is very important thing because I saw several couples, they had bad relationships and nothing good ideas. Mm-hmm (affirmative). Actually, I can't remember any worst project because in any project, I try to do everything. Their factory, yes. Their factory. We saw how they create their mayonnaise. It was really interesting, but they didn't want to mention about the process of production of mayonnaise. Because actually, it was a very different period in this agency because we had no creative director and we have several teams which was absolutely different without one head. And our manager [inaudible 00:35:32] decided to give the project to several groups. It was very ... it was bad situation because there was several group leaders who didn't decide to find agreements and ... but we have a rather good customer service, I mean accounts. They tried to save situation.   No. Actually, have presentation, present it to the client our ideas and there were about three ideas. I think it was ... They were rather nice but because we had three leaders for three ideas, I think client was really disorientated. So in the finally, client has changed another idea, not our agency idea about testimonial.",

    "location": "Moscow",
    "text": "For me? For me, when probably it's an inner feeling. It's like I feel I've done a good job, and it's a job nobody has done before. Well, maybe when I show the work to some people of the same industry, or some people out of the industry, which are just consumers, and they see it and they say, `Yeah, I like it,` this is probably the best thing for me to hear. Of course it's not that I'm looking for their praise or something. It's just that when they're sincere and I ask their sincere opinion and they say it's good, then this is probably the evidence for me that the project is done well. I worked for Phillip Morris, and we had quite a challenging task to make a sort of activity out of nothing. We had no money, we had no time, we had nothing actually. Me, together with my art director, created a promotion when people had to tell their story, which was limited to 280 signs, if I'm ... I don't remember exactly but approximately this number of signs. They had to tell their story, short and funny story, and the best selected stories were published in the magazine. No he is really, because he just came back from shooting and he now has to do the cuts and things like that. The copper lines were actually these fake stories from all over the world. We have them on the outdoor. That really generated a buzz in the city, and we had a very high response rate. I actually quit Leo Burnett by that time, but my art director kept working there, and he told me that the response rate was really a very good one. They received a lot of stories. This is the project which I actually liked, because we had very limited time. We had almost no budget, and we created something out of nothing. The client felt positive about the project, and I felt positive about the project, because nobody has done this before. So, we were sort of pioneers by creating something out of nothing. As I said earlier, it's quite important that people have the same understanding of what is good and what is bad, and there is no interior politics interfering with the business process, which actually often happens with big companies like this one, and like Leo Burnett, like [inaudible 00:11:08] where I previously worked. I really hate it, because I think it really stagnates the process, prevents it from moving on, and doing our best. There are too many people, and too many people want to show everyone they're so damn important, and I think it only does harm to the business process, and that's what we quite often face, esp working with a network, there is a lot of misunderstanding. It's not that I don't trust other people's experiences, it's a very good thing when people come and share it, but it's not a very good thing when a person just relies on his experience in a different country, but he thinks that since he has this great experience, he knows what to do here in this country. Each country is different, and you have to understand how things work here, and not to be so stubborn and prove you're the most important person. So, I think it's a really, really great problem of huge companies. It's not only [inaudible 00:12:22], I think it's almost everywhere. Yeah, it's all about these ill natured ambitions I think, of some people, which to me, it's just ridiculous. Well, if we're talking about this project that I've mentioned before, then there were only two people, me and my art director, who created the idea. But generally, the team was definitely bigger. It was around, let me think, one, two, three, well, let's say about five people in the team, including account people because they were definitely important. By that time, I think we really had a great team of supporters, and probably two or three around that. But as I said before, we really had a team of supporters, and we were very much supported. But the good thing about her that she was not afraid to take a risk upon herself. She was not afraid of expressing her own opinion openly and freely. This is something that you really find in marketing people, because generally, people are damn scared to express their opinion, because they're afraid it will not match the opinion of the person at the top. She was not afraid of that. I think it's a very, very rare thing, not only in Russia but everywhere. I tend to work with people from abroad, and my opinion is not that they are more experienced or braver than Russian marketing people. Same thing. Yes, if we talk about international companies, then I think business process work much better there than within Russian companies. In Russian companies, I think this ambition problem that I've touched upon before, is actually even higher and bigger than within the international companies. In international companies there is a scheme which they use throughout the world, which in a way refrains people from being ill ambitioned, if you know what I mean. I think within Russian companies, it's very much, it's quite typical I would say, for Russian companies, esp for people who do well, who have good positions, top positions, top management. I actually face it over here, working with a huge Russian client that they only trust their opinion and intuition, which is quite often not based on any professional experience or cases, or whatever. So, it's just like, `Well, I like this, so, we're going to do this, because I like it, and that's it.` I think it's not a correct approach. I think they did not do any research because of time. They didn't have time. They were not actually very much inclined to do the research. My inner feeling is that, doing these endless focus groups and things like that, does not bring a lot of good, because the situation when you test creative materials, is quite artificial. The psychological pattern to which people stick because of the situation, is completely different from their occasional attention when they see it on TV or as an outdoor. So, the reaction that you receive from people is sometimes just so ... My experience with focus groups, because I really hate focus groups is that, people tend to choose the most neutral and the less inspirational creative work. When it is produced, it is insipid, absolutely insipid. It's about nothing. So to me, it's just the malfunction of the method itself, because the situation is artificial. I have just completed the article about sex and advertising. In this article, I was also talking about my experience when we tested at commercial, which was very, very difficult ones in terms of ... On the one hand, we had this heaven idea, this Adam and Eve and that kind of stuff is the plot of the story. We also had some sex in that. The reaction of people was incredible. Half of the audience really liked the ad. Another half hated it because of this mixture. Interesting thing, I asked marketing people, different people from Nestle, from Dannon and other companies, and none of them said it was because of the religious feelings of people who were at the test, but rather, it was because they were quite embarrassed to talk about this in public and to say, `Yes I like it,` because the subject was quite a tricky one. So, it was like, `I want to be socially acceptable. I want to be a normal member of the society. I don't want other people to think bad about me. I'd better say it's not a good ad.` So, that's just ... I'm sorry I somehow- nteresting thing, I asked marketing people, different people from Nestle, from Dannon and other companies, and none of them said it was because of the religious feelings of people who were at the test, but rather, it was because they were quite embarrassed to talk about this in public and to say, `Yes I like it,` because the subject was quite a tricky one. So, it was like, `I want to be socially acceptable. I want to be a normal member of the society. I don't want other people to think bad about me. I'd better say it's not a good ad.` So, that's just ... I'm sorry I somehow- I actually don't very much believe in the research. I think if a company wants to conduct good research, it should research the material in different ways, not only focus groups, which all companies like. But also, some quantitative research just to have a thorough picture of what's actually happening. Absolutely, absolutely. They don't think generally, they think with some exact details they see, and that's the problem that you come upon. Well, there is also such a thing that people, the society is actually structured. It has several layers, social layers. There are some trend spotters, trend followers, and that kind of stuff. So again, advertising and industrial design in particular, I'm not sure that they have to stick solely to the opinion of trend followers, because sometimes it is better to be half a step ahead of these people, to attract them. Trend setters, they will like it, and somehow, the trend followers will follow the opinion of the trend setters. I think research companies, they often miss this. They just don't consider this. Mostly negative I would say. I would say mostly negative. There were some really good projects that were highly estimated, highly liked by the client, but in most projects, we had a very, very difficult time with this client. From this project on, I personally felt, I had more credibility from the client, and it's much easier for me to express my opinion and why we do this and not that. Yeah, but anyway, it was quite limited both time and budget. Taller deadlines. Deadlines. I remember that we sat together with my art director, and it was midnight, and we sat at the kitchen in the office, and it was like, `I feel so sleepy, I want to sleep so much. The metro will close in an hour, we'll have to take a taxi, oh my God! I don't want to take a taxi. The company will pay for that, but anyway, I don't want to go like this,` and that kind of stuff. Somewhere after yeah, but she was the one who accepted the project, and who loved the project. Moreover, I know that headquarters did not like the project. She took the risk upon herself, and she persuaded them that we should have this project. As I said, she was a very, very brave marketing person. Somehow, I thought that's probably not what I want, because I still want to eat where I go eat and drive my car, and that kind of thing. So, I decided to stay within the industry, but still, I started making some steps to decide still being here. I also thought, if I cannot change the situation, then what am I going to do? Change my view upon it. I worked on that, and I'd actually succeeded. So now to me, it's a sort of game. When I go to a client, and I see a completely insane person, who knows absolutely nothing about people who buy the product, about the consumers, but who believes she or he knows absolutely everything about the audience, that she has great professional experience and blah, blah, blah, and actually, she or he does not need creative people because she can write everything on her own, or maybe he, it doesn't matter. So, I started playing the game like I'm a psychiatrist and they're my patients. So, when I come to their offices and I talk to them, I try to be very attentive, I smile, I talk to them, I agree and I say yes, yes, yes. But to me, my inner feeling is like, I'm a psychiatrist and I talk to insane people, and that helps me work here. Otherwise, if I took everything seriously, I would go insane myself. There are so many beautiful things in life that I want to keep sanity, brains. There was another thing also, there was another thing also. We didn't have any arguments within the team. So, we just came and said, ` We love this idea, and we've got to sell it.` That's what we did. There were no people interfering with their great experience, their idea of what the clients would like, and what the clients would not like, that kind of stuff. So, nobody interfered into that. That was our personal responsibility, and we had credit for that. That's very important, and that's actually what often hampers us from doing a quality, quality work, too many people interfering, with their great professional expression, their great judgment on how things should be done, and that kind of stuff. I think that there should be only one person, who takes ultimate responsibility upon him or herself, only one on the project. That's it. He is the one who decides whether we go with this or we don't. When there are strategic director, account director, creative director and some other directors, and everybody wants to express his or her valuable opinion, that hampers us from ... That's a barrier. That's an obstacle to do a good job. There should be only one person who has the last word, yes or no. As I told you, I can't remember exactly whether we had the creative director by that time with us or not. I remember that we were selling this to the account director. We came and said, `We have a great idea, we love it, we want to present it.` She was able to listen to people, which is quite important in our work. I can't remember whether we had a strategic department structured as we have it here. We had a person who was, she was the managing director of the BTL agency of Leo Burnett, called Black Pencil. You might have heard of it. She was Australian, great girl. We talked to her. We presented that idea to her, she liked it as well, and she was more business minded. She said, `The strong points are this, this and that. The weak points are, this, this and that. But overall, I like it, and I think we should sell it.` So, she was, I think if we talk about strategy, then the strategic person was probably that managing director of BTL agency of Leo Burnett. So, we didn't have any specific strategic department for Phillip Morris. but it's not a very good thing when a person just relies on his experience in a different country, but he thinks that since he has this great experience, he knows what to do here in this country. Each country is different, and you have to understand how things work here, She had a very strong, persuasive power I would say. She was able to persuade everyone that she was right, and she was able to take a risk upon herself. Her career's still a good one. She had a very, very, good promotion, first within Phillip Morris, and now she's with a huge Russian mobile operator, and she feels very well.   My experience with focus groups, because I really hate focus groups is that, people tend to choose the most neutral and the less inspirational creative work. When it is produced, it is insipid, absolutely insipid. It's about nothing. Taller deadlines. Deadlines. I remember that we sat together with my art director, and it was midnight, and we sat at the kitchen in the office, and it was like, `I feel so sleepy, I want to sleep so much. The metro will close in an hour, we'll have to take a taxi, oh my God! I don't want to take a taxi. The company will pay for that, but anyway, I don't want to go like this,` and that kind of stuff. Somehow, we were sitting, joking, yawning, and that kind of stuff, and it just struck. I don't remember who was the first, me or him, to say it out loud, but it was just, we were thinking on that, but we were talking about some other things like, which night club are we going to? Is it next Friday? That kind of stuff. No, at some point, there was another woman taking the position of the girl that I was talking about earlier, the girl that was group brand manager or something like this. She had a promotion, so, she still controlled the actions of the girl who came instead of her. The girl who came instead of her, she almost, almost every time consulted the senior girl. To be perfectly honest with you, two years ago, maybe one year and a half, I was very much depressed about my work in general, because I saw that most work we do here has nothing to do with creativity actually. It's like selling hamburgers. You understand what I mean. Yeah exactly, exactly, and you go and do that, especially with the companies that we have within our agency portfolio, and I actually work with almost ll companies we have as clients. I felt very much depressed because of that, really. I tried to make some steps to some other industries like PR kind of stuff, then I realized that if I change the industry, that I will lose money because of experience, because, anyway, people who started at PR industry, they have great experience, they have better social connections that I do. So, it means my salary will go down anyway. When I go to a client, and I see a completely insane person, who knows absolutely nothing about people who buy the product, about the consumers, but who believes she or he knows absolutely everything about the audience, that she has great professional experience and blah, blah, blah, and actually, she or he does not need creative people because she can write everything on her own, or maybe he, it doesn't matter. Yeah, yeah. Honestly, it helps me a lot. When I talk to people and I understand, she's nuts, `Okay, let her be nuts, she wants to be like this, okay. I'm a psychiatrist, I have to understand her. You are Napoleon, okay, yeah sure. No problem, no big deal.` Well, I was scared of her, I hated her, and I thought she was the hysterical type, and I still think she is. I don't think that a professional person, I believe that a professional person can keep emotions, can manage her or his emotions, and somehow refrain from shouting at people, and things like that. I think it's highly unprofessional to do that. I'm a very emotional person, and I know that sometimes when I'm just fuming, I can start shouting. I hate myself for this. So, I really work hard on eliminating this terrible feature, because that's really terrible. I think for marketing people especially when they are close to the top, it's completely unprofessional.",

    "text": "There were many projects like that, but again, it depends on what we mean by didn't go well. Let's say, I had an experience when we had a brilliant idea, but, it was very difficult to sell it to the client here. We managed to sell it with the help of our London office. But later on when the person, the key person from the London office went back home, it all was redone, and what we went with finally, was something, to me it's rubbish actually. Well, it has some strong points, but still, it's something very, very average. The other issue is that, he was friends with the marketing director, but that's all rubbish. The fact is, he sold it. So, he sold the idea that we created here and he liked it, and everybody liked it. I remember the creative director, our creative director, he had a very positive opinion about this idea. Again, this idea was generated by me and my art director, with whom by the way, I worked at Leo Burnett. At that time, he was here with us. So, that London person- By that time, the London person went back home, and I don't know what exactly happened on the client's side, but what we finally heard, that the client refused going further on with that idea, and made us create something else. Sergei, whom you'll interview tomorrow, he created the idea, and he found a very strong visual element I would call it, within the idea. I think that was a very strong point of this idea. But overall, I think the approach itself and the idea itself was weaker than what we sold before. But, the client went with that because they said, `Here is our target audience, it's quite important that we show our target audience the TV commercials, because otherwise, people will not understand the commercial is for them,` and that kind of shit. It's an absolute crap really. Well, it's hard for me to judge, but I think it's the problem of most clients here. They believe that if they don't show a target audience within the commercial, then the target audience will not get it is for them. They will not relate to the commercial. The commercial that we- Yeah, Russian Kit Kat people, yeah. The commercial that we initially sold to them was like this, there were two burly men in a showroom, at a table with a lot of hoses and tights and that kind of stuff. So, they were now stretching those tights, and there was hoses and that kind of stuff. They looked at colors and patterns, and they discussed it between themselves, `Look, such beautiful flowers here. I like pink tights,` that kind of stuff. Then, one of the men said, `Let's have a break,` they had Kit Kat. Then, through the cut, we saw them robbing a bank, wearing those funny hoses. Yeah, that was really funny, that was quite, quite unusual for Russian advertising. What I personally liked about that is the sense of humor that was in. I don't think that advertising which makes people laugh is a bad one. I think it's a very, very positive feeling and you have very positive attitude towards reels with humor. So, that was the idea. The feedback we had from the client, eventually, we had from the client is that, there is no target audience, people will not relate to it, they will not understand it, it will not drive sales, and that kind of stuff. What they finally went with is a story. Well, there was actually three stories about young people. There was a girl who said, `You can get a mark at the exam for profound knowledge or for beautiful eyes.` Well, there is an expression in the Russian language, beautiful eyes, which means for nothing, for the beautiful eyes. For the beautiful eyes, it's like an idiom, a play upon words. Then all of a sudden, it read Kit Kat on an armchair appeared in the room. She jumped on that, ate the bar, and then she said, Tomorrow, I'll wear a miniskirt.` That's it. So to me, it's really flat, there is no humor in that.   The only strong element which I see here, strong in terms of branding, is the armchair, which was created by Sergei, and that was a strong point in the reel, but that's it. There is no humor, there is no touch, to me. Maybe to other people there is. But anyway, I think it's flat, to me it's flat. That's what we went eventually with. There were so many people I'll tell you. There were strategic people, creative people, I can't remember exactly. But, the team was really huge. It was about maybe seven people participating, and that was another problem, that we had so much discussion within the agency, what we should do and what we shouldn't do, that kind of stuff. Tiring, really tiring. Maybe, maybe. That's so funny. They sometimes tell us, `We went through the office asking our colleagues what they think about this video.` I see those zombies and I can't imagine what they tell them, because they are abnormal people really. They're not consumers that watch TV. They're so far away from that, really. I would say half of those people participated in the process. There was one person or maybe two, from the creatives, one person from the strategic department, and one person from the account department. That's a very rough breakdown, so it's not exact. Yes, the creative director participated in that. He was actually very happy and very positive about the first idea that was sold to the client. I'm afraid they did not test it, I'm afraid they did not test it because they ... By the way, I'm afraid that the year that we sold that idea, they did not have any tests. I remember them having tests one year after that, when we worked on the U Campaign, but by that time, I was not participating at this riveting activity. Yeah, yeah. Well, it might have worked against us as well. My attitude towards test is, it's a very, very cunning thing, very cunning thing, especially because they're quite flat. They don't go deep down, they don't use some techniques that they should use and should think about creating, inventing those techniques. Yeah, of course. It's just to hide yourself behind the papers, `I have the research results.` Absolutely, that's so incredible. The worst thing is that it was just after I came here. So, I came here and I had that project. I was so depressed. Really, I thought I would quit, I would quit straight away. So, I started calling to HR people saying, `Probably, it's not the place I want to work with.` Again, we sat and drank with my art director, I can't remember anything in particular. Just thinking in a more or less relaxed way, if you know what I mean. It's not that we disregarded the deadlines, it's just that we don't create inner stress within the team. No, no, no, not exactly. That was probably one of the occasions, and I have enough fingers on one of my hands to name those occasions when our network really helped us a lot. It was not like we had a clash with them or we had a misunderstanding with them, it was really a hard period we went through with them, because we had so much shit from them, really, absolutely biased one. But still, the person who came, he did the key thing that people here could not do. They could not sell their idea to the client, he managed to do that. `Here is our target audience, it's quite important that we show our target audience the TV commercials, because otherwise, people will not understand the commercial is for them,` and that kind of shit. It's an absolute crap really. They can't stand any risk really. It's better to stick to something very flat, which will give them 1% of sales. Otherwise, what if they drop sales by 10%? They will all get fired. That's crazy. Can you imagine? People that say everything is crap, for almost two years.",

    "text": "But on the other side, it was really interesting, and what we've got finally was really interesting. Because when you are given ... When you are approached by a client that doesn't want to do any ads and moreover in the way they state themselves is that they've got a charter, I think, that says that they don't advertise, which is already an interesting idea to approach an ad agency with such and such a client, you know, being such a client. Anyway, sometime ago, we won Google locally, and I do have some Google accounts in some other countries, but anyway, they don't advertise, but on the other side they wanted to do it. Finally ... I'm speaking for the end of the process. We finally did a campaign for Google. It was the first organic Google campaign in the world because the previous experience they had, and we knew about that. It was in China when they tried to do something and they never got the approval of the central lodge, I'd say because it looked like a sect actually. Then we started spending a lot of time with them, really a lot of time. Spending a lot of time with the product, spending a lot of time with the people, and finally somehow in these conversations actually, we found out what we want because we were bringing them a lot of things. We invented. We put a lot of mind into it. At the other side, what we really had to do instead of that, we have to talk, like talk a lot. This is the moment where we all took part in it. We all became Moscow experts. We started finding out really interesting stuff on history, on like encyclopedic information. At this moment, we were stopped by the client that said, `Look, this is good. We can have about 60 to 70% of this type of stuff but we would like also to be useful.` Being useful is being minute in these type of things. It didn't look the same as these encyclopedic information so we had to struggle for each and every message so that it would be interesting and at the same time useful and not mundane and wouldn't be just road signs. This took us into writing about 500 ads, which is tedious, and we spent ... I practically spent my lifetime there. I mean I went there in the morning and I left in the evening because this is where it was not to work not in the office but with the client because they won't be able to react very fast, and we have to do it fast. This took us into writing about 500 ads, which is tedious, and we spent ... I practically spent my lifetime there. I mean I went there in the morning and I left in the evening because this is where it was not to work not in the office but with the client because they won't be able to react very fast, and we have to do it fast. Finally, we've got everything in the streets and a lot of people saw these things. To my feeling, it should have stayed there longer but I know that it finally got the third place on the Moscow Festival for this campaign, and I'm not sure if they haven't taken it somewhere else right now. I mean like [inaudible 00:14:03]. But I'm not sure. I don't know if Ivan has taken it. Anyway, the main thing here was to stop dictating to the client what they need. It was this moment when we have to stop being this big agency from network that knows better and just start listening to the people. At some moment, we were not doing it and we were losing it all the time. Then finally, we just started being very intelligent and clever and just talking. We found out that it's a lot of fun, and we made very good friends with them so now they're bringing us absolutely impossible things to do and then they're saying, `Well, we know you're like great. You can do it.` Oops. This is somehow ... Now, it's funny because it's like a kid that has broken the vase and he knows that's you can actually mend stuff and he's bringing you something very, very broken. He says, `Well, you can do it. You're the big guy so you can do it.` Sometimes it's tedious and but at the same time, it's fun. Well, I would say that this is how ... Maybe I didn't describe it properly but this is one of my favorite experiences here. No, no, no, no. Actually, lots of people were involved and then one person approved everything. It's funny but it couldn't stand any offline communication. Every time we went offline, we were in trouble. Every time we were there, and we were with them or they were here, but basically usually it was the other way around, it was ... It went fluent. At the same time, once again, we decided that we would decide that everything else would be on email. It all stopped because ... I don't know why. These people are representing the second ... next era of electronic communication. At the same time, they are very bad on maintaining it for themselves. They invented for other people but they're very hard for themself. Yeah. Because they were not totally clear what they need and we try to dictate. We tried to invent something for them and we ended up nowhere. All of a sudden, we came up with this not very ad-like thing and everybody ... All of a sudden we went off work and we did a good job. Yeah, yeah. The one who decided and his mates. There were a couple of people there but of course, he's the main guy. He also wanted to do something because first of all, I thought he's also against it but then I found out that they have a lot of restrictions. I mean they still have to sit in front of these people and the- I would say for me, I would say even some of my colleagues would say that this guy doesn't want to but I know him ... I think I know him better now. He's just very cooperative style person, like corporation guy. But he wants to. Yes, it's unusual because usually the big problem with this country would be ... I don't know how ... I wouldn't say these days it's not worse but it used to be this way. You would meet the client on the project and the client would be local and would be a girl that would say, ` You know this is risky and the people would not understand us.` Then I would say, `Look, we should sort of do the educational thing. We should do it and make them move a little bit.` She wouldn't say that back to me but she would mean something like `I do not want to take the risks and I don't want to because I actually don't care very much because in a year or two, I'm going to marry some ... I know a guy from [Lasana 00:30:37], and ...` Like for example, if that's Nestle or somebody else, and just leave. They were not really concerned about the market here. Now, it's a little bit better because there are a lot of enthusiasts on the market. Because I know there were times when they took a lot of risks just because nobody knew what's going on. It was very new. I mean the industry was very new and they were risky. They were doing interesting stuff and then actually it was the only time when we got ... when this country ever got aligned, and actually Ivan took part in it. There was times when nobody knew how to do it. Now, everybody knows and somehow at the same time, they're not taking that many risks. Well, it happens when kids start walking. They don't know how to walk sometimes. Yeah. Then they start falling some moment because they become confident. It's called I think the syndrome of a fake professional because you think that you're professional enough then you start falling. Anyway, then sometimes in time, people lose momentum and it's easier for them to do things they know how to do and they stop making risks. Oh, that was a funny moment because in the middle of the process, I found myself running up to our client service director, Katz, and saying, `Guys, I'm sure it's a good thing we're doing but maybe it's not worth it because we're spending so much time.` They went back to the client and said, `Look, we are spending a lot of time on you.` They said, `Maybe we should streamline the process,` and they just said, `Just tell us how much it cost. We want this to be done, and if it has to be done with a lot of resources, just let us know. We'll pay.` Very warm because at some moment ... I'd say the coefficient of tolerance now is crazy because I can joke about stuff. It's like you can joke about the process and you can actually say very serious things to them and they listen because at some moment I said, `Look guys, it looks like we're trying to have sex on a jumping board because we're not ... We all want it very much but we're always flying by each other and we can't finally get to it because ...` They understand such things now. So I would say there's a lot of personal ... Well, it's a very personal business. I mean all our business is very tied into relations. In the way of once you get into it, I mean like first meetings with the client, any client especially client that have previously spoiled relations with ... For example, when they change the team and stuff and you get on it. You have to do a series of very good jobs for them so that they start being more ... give you more credits and stop walking each and every step with you and being more ... It's like taming some animal. I don't know. Then finally, all of a sudden, you have very good relations where you got ... and at the same you got huge amount of freedom. This is the thing we all like very much. Sometimes maybe too much because sometimes too much freedom doesn't yield a good decision. Yes. This is the thing. Before you spoil anything, you have more credits and more freedom because they know that you've done good some times ago. Sometimes people change. You've used to work with this person and then the agency, and all of sudden, he's a client. Whoops. Something happens to this person. Well, sometimes it does. Sometimes it depends. It just all depends whether the person is reasonable. I mean if this was not the fault of mine and the other person, maybe it won't. But [crosstalk 00:41:28] if it was somebody's fault like mine for example, yes, of course, it will. Usually, there are two aspects to it. Sometimes you wouldn't take such a project because for me, I'm very ... I remember bad things very well. That's the way my mind is working. I'd say I've got a very good memory for bad things. No. I'm joking of course. Usually, I would try to improve relations of course. I've tried to improve the way people take me or the company for that matter because I'm usually very much oriented toward making a good relation with the client so that the company has a very good image. Well, of course, I mean like this cat won't respect you. It won't respect you anyway but it's just because cats are like that. If you give a cat a ... What do you call it? When you punch it with a foot or if you ... the cat would fly away but it will fly its own direction. This is how it usually happens with the creative guys. See, if you try to punish them or something, they just take it. They just move their own way. Now, I'm joking of course but on the other side, I think it's possible to make people create. So the client service, since they were on this process also, they were much on our side. Well, I don't know. I don't have much problems. Personally, me, I don't have much problems with client service usually. I'm very client, account-oriented because I know that you can't live without them and I don't despise them as the other creatives do. I think it's a dogma and I don't like dogmas. We could have arrived on it earlier. We could have gotten best, better media and we could have just maybe streamlined the process because the client could have, I don't know, been faster on taking decisions. On the other side, it's a good project. I would say the nature of it is ... You can analyze stuff only if you have previous knowledge, right? nyway, the main thing here was to stop dictating to the client what they need. It was this moment when we have to stop being this big agency from network that knows better and just start listening to the people. At some moment, we were not doing it and we were losing it all the time. Then finally, we just started being very intelligent and clever and just talking. We found out that it's a lot of fun, and we made very good friends with them so now they're bringing us absolutely impossible things to do and then they're saying, `Well, we know you're like great. You can do it.` Oops. This is somehow ... Now, it's funny because it's like a kid that has broken the vase and he knows that's you can actually mend stuff and he's bringing you something very, very broken. He says, `Well, you can do it. You're the big guy so you can do it.` Sometimes it's tedious and but at the same time, it's fun.   `Well, we have problems because we don't have any strategic feeling about ... You don't have it. We haven't written you anything on that because you didn't think about it.` There were three of us. It was me and the group. Actually, everybody was digging up information and stuff. Basically, there was a copywriter and there was a now director girl but we all took part in collecting information and getting interesting stuff out of thin air and then finalizing it. Just because I even invented ... I said, why don't we take two groups and one works on odd days and the other works on even days because they always change their opinion and so that they could work properly like  At the same time, they are very bad on maintaining it for themselves. They invented for other people but they're very hard for themself. The local client was really, really for it but they have to battle with the center that never has done such a thing, and so we were like a test, too. She wouldn't say that back to me but she would mean something like `I do not want to take the risks and I don't want to because I actually don't care very much because in a year or two, I'm going to marry some They were doing interesting stuff and then actually it was the only time when we got ... when this country ever got aligned, and actually Ivan took part in it. There was times when nobody knew how to do it. Now, everybody knows and somehow at the same time, they're not taking that many risks. Well, it happens when kids start walking. They don't know how to walk sometimes. Yes. Very good. We have to because we spend a lot of time together. I'm an affiliative creative director. I usually value relations more than some other stuff. Well, of course, the work has to be done but on the other side, I'm affiliative. I think that in our department, it's impossible to do anything to people if they don't want to because otherwise ... Well, of course, there has to be discipline but on the other side, you can't make people create. his was something which spoiled a lot of effort because for example they would forget ... They would buy us a address program that wasn't very convenient for this project, and we have to beg them for variants and each variant would be rewriting the respective text. So that will be a lot of hassle on this end. Of course, everybody was ... It added up some nerves to it.",

They said, `Well, how much time and how much money do you need to produce this?` There we are. In three weeks, we're in there with that thing.` Then the stocks went out. They lost the stocks.

    "text": "With me, personally, I have to run from a client and I mean I really have to run off the account because ... and now, we've got a group doing this stuff because somehow I got really ... I really got into getting crazy because it was so strangely organized on the client side. It's not the client service side but it's their own thing. They never know what they want. They have a lot of disrespect to the agency. They're trying to compete their agency. There's a very good book that was written by a guy. His name is Johnny Gatardo and the book is called Advertisement Beats Working for a Living. It's a very small book but on the other side, there's a lot of very nice stuff there and these are like ... They have seven deadly sins of the client and seven deadly sins of the agency. These seven deadly sins were committed ... All of them were committed by the client. They had a very tedious general marketing director. She's a very strange lady. Estranged I'd say. These guys were competing with us. They were giving us a brief and at the same time, they were trying to think of something on their own every time and all the other stuff that they were doing. I had to run from it because somehow I really started falling ill with them because when ... We are soldiers sort of. We cannot get ourselves in the situation wherein we're not performing. We're trying to perform all the times and if it never gets any life, it's like you are losing your function. This is something which puts me in an asylum, you know. This is the moment I just threw the towel, and maybe that was childish but I said, `Well, you know, it seems like I can't work on this exact account because it beats me. It defies my ...` Yes, yes. When came to the agency and I found out that this account, this client ... I mean this product has such a badly built base and they still have so little visual material that we can show and all sorts of things. I was beating the whole thing. I said, `Well, I've got a lot of ideas how we can improve, and I have them.` By the end of the day, I said, `Well, you know, you've killed me, guys.` Which was not professional and it's still a big fault of mine I think. I don't like myself for nothing for this exact story. Zillions. I mean from our side, we have a dead team because they couldn't work anymore and when I came, they were still on the project but they were like dead so I picked it up myself which I shouldn't have done. It was me and the strategics and their client service and somehow ... No. We ended up three people doing this project now. At first, I just couldn't put anybody there, and I had to do it myself and this is where I maybe I burnt my fingers. Well, basically, it's funny because there are four or five minion ladies and there was this main lady. Also, we had the network. It was doing strange things to us because we couldn't show anything to the local client before the networks use it. The network is not very cooperative on this thing. It wasn't. It wasn't. Somehow that was maybe something else or some sort of personal thing there. So, basically four I think. There was one main lady that didn't take credits of the fact that she is ruling the main market for this product except for Germany and she didn't take the responsibility. I mean she could have used it to be more decisive and she didn't, and this is a pity. Yeah. It was funny. At some moment, I was so negative. I said, `Look, guys. You are actually biting all our fresh leaves off.` I said, `Why, why?` I just feel we can do it this way.` All of a sudden, the client said, `Okay. Let's go into research.` This is where we should have stopped ourselves and said, `No, no, no, no, no. Let us decide here exactly what we researched because if you're going to interfere on the preparation stage, we're not getting a right answer and it means like you're mostly framing us this way.` But still they did research and the research went out. It has come out as all the research is happening with this client because they are advertising one thing and they are trying to research another because they have male-looking product and they are trying to get out warmth but they never put into the ads. So, it's funny. They're trying to collect something that they don't ... It's like when you plant, I don't know, peaches and try to collect oranges, expect to collect oranges. `Wow, we're getting peaches. We're getting a lot of peaches here. Why?` Because we have a peach tree for God's sake. It's funny. Well, exactly how I described it previously. Trying to get warmth into a very cold and otherwise unfriendly brand, which is the market leader to some extent but we never know. Maybe we should get more warmth into it but then we'll ... Because we are not getting warmth as a ... It should be friendly and sort of amicable, and all of a sudden, this thing is not friendly and amicable. Who in hell decided that if a brand called Monarch could be friendly and amicable? But we ended up trying to do it. Well, I think if not to take the technical issues, they never pay. Well, they do of course but they're not paying time. But that's some sort of their own thing. Yes, I think it was adequate. I haven't done anything. I just run away. But we've done something now and well, I don't know. You should ask [Jima 01:01:36]. He's okay with it. The other- When you get together with the smaller ladies, they were all very nice but all of a sudden, when she entered the room, everybody started being very mean to us. I would say they're mean. Now, it's much, much better because they never ... They never renewed the contract with the old lady so she had to leave to another company. Now, I think everything is better but still they're trying to compete with ... Also, the network is trying to compete with us. They didn't like us doing original work somehow, which I find a little bit of ... Not a law, of course, but I find that in other networks. I didn't see a lot of very generous networks. I mean they all want results and money, and of course, they don't want to take risks or they usually say, `Why don't you take our work?` They were okay but of course they got pissed off when I left. That's all. Of course, since the client wasn't very clear, they sometimes also broke your mind because, of course, they convey a lot of things that the clients sort of invents. Usually, it ends up with everybody's brain damaged. This is the moment I just threw the towel, and maybe that was childish but I said, `Well, you know, it seems like I can't work on this exact account because it beats me. It defies my . I mean this product has such a badly built base and they still have so little visual material that we can show and all sorts of things. I was beating the whole thing. I said, `Well, I've got a lot of ideas how we can improve, and I have them.` By the end of the day, I said, `Well, you know, you've killed me, guys.` Which was not professional and it's still a big fault of mine I think. I don't like myself for nothing for this exact story. At first, I just couldn't put anybody there, and I had to do it myself and this is where I maybe I burnt my fingers. eah. It was funny. At some moment, I was so negative. I said, `Look, guys. You are actually biting all our fresh leaves off.` I said, `Why, why?` I just feel we can do it this way.` All of a sudden, the client said, `Okay. Let's go into research.` This is where we should have stopped ourselves and said, `No, no, no, no, no. Let us decide here exactly what we researched because if you're going to interfere on the preparation stage, we're not getting a right answer and it means like you're mostly framing us this way.` Actually, this is what happened because she said, `Let's go into research` but they tweaked not because they wanted us to fail. They just tweaked it because they felt like it should look like this. We should have researched what we want and it tweaked. That tweaking, I think, to my feeling, tweaking has also obscured the results somehow.   I think, in Russian at all.` It just doesn't. Then in a year or two or three, once you were doing good work, they start listening to you and that's nice. But usually, it comes through a lot of tedious explanations.",
